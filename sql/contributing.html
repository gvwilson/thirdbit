<p>Use <code>uv venv</code> and <code>uv pip install -r pyproject.toml</code>
    to install the packages required by the helper tools and Python examples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The source files for examples are in their section directories
    along with captured output in <code>.out</code> files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Makefile</code> contains the commands used to re-run each example.
    If you add a new example,
    please add a corresponding rule in <code>Makefile</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a level-2 heading for each sub-topic.
    Use <code>{: .aside}</code> for an aside
    or <code>{: .exercise}</code> for exercise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please create SVG diagrams using <a href="https://www.drawio.com/">draw.io</a>.

<p>Please use <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/">Conventional Commits</a> style for pull requests
by using <code>change:</code>, <code>feature:</code>, <code>fix:</code>, or <code>task:</code> as the first word
in the title of the commit message.
You may also use <code>publish:</code> if the PR just rebuilds the HTML version of the lesson.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Why SQL?</dt>
<dd>Because if you dig down far enough,
almost every data science project sits on top of a relational database.
(<a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/">Jon Udell</a> once called <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>
"an operating system for data science".)
SQL's relational model has also been a powerful influence
on dataframe libraries like <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">the tidyverse</a>,
<a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>,
and <a href="https://pola.rs/">Polars</a>;
understanding the former therefore helps people understand the latter.</dd>
<dt>Why <a href="https://pypi.org/project/mccole/">McCole</a>?</dt>
<dd>The first version of this tutorial used <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>
because it is the default for <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>
and because its frustrating limitations would discourage contributors
from messing around with the template instead of writing content.
However,
those limitations proved more frustrating than anticipated:
in particular,
very few data scientists speak Ruby,
so previewing changes locally required them to install and use
yet another language framework.</dd>
<dt>Why Make?</dt>
<dd>It runs everywhere,
no other build tool is a clear successor,
and,
like Jekyll,
it's uncomfortable enough to use that people won't be tempted to fiddle with it
when they could be writing.</dd>
<dt>Why hand-drawn figures rather than <a href="https://graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a> or <a href="https://mermaid.js.org/">Mermaid</a>?</dt>
<dd>Because it's faster to Just Effing Draw than it is
to try to tweak layout parameters for text-to-diagram systems.
If you really want to make developers' lives better,
build a diff-and-merge tool for SVG:
programmers shouldn't have to use punchard-compatible data formats in the 21st Century
just to get the benefits of version control.</dd>
<dt>Why make this tutorial freely available?</dt>
<dd>Because if we all give a little, we all get a lot.</dd>
