## First Collaborator

- Tahia joins the lab
- Wants to use the existing data and clean up some more

<div align="center">
  <p>
    <img src="../files/jess.svg" alt="Jess Avatar" width="20%" /></a>
    <img src="../files/tahia.svg" alt="Tahia Avatar" width="20%" /></a>
  </p>
</div>

- Jess divides the code between two repositories
  - One for data and data cleaning
  - The other for the simulation

---

## Collaboration as Learning

- Jess and Tahia start using pull requests in the data cleaning repo
- Biggest benefit is code review
  - Jess can look over Tahia's code before merging it
  - Her coding style improves as a result of the reviews
  - Which reduces the load on Jess
- Jess has been reading [Stack Overflow][stack] for years
- Starts posting questions for the first time
  - And including links to questions and answers in code and commits

<div align="center">
  <p>
    <img src="../files/stack-overflow.png" alt="Stack Overflow logo" width="40%" /></a>
  </p>
</div>

---

## Sharing Data as Files

- Tahia and Jess decide to put data on [DataDryad][datadryad]
- Get a DOI for every dataset from [Zenodo][zenodo]
- Require everyone in the lab to get an [ORCID][orcid]

<div align="center">
  <p>
    <img src="../files/dryad.png" alt="DataDryad logo" width="30%" /></a>
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="../files/zenodo.png" alt="Zenodo logo" width="30%" /></a>
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="../files/orcid.svg" alt="ORCID logo" width="30%" /></a>
  </p>
</div>

---

## Sharing Data as Packages

- Jess turns the simulation into a Python package
  - Includes a few data files
  - Can be installed directly from GitHub with `pip`

```
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/gvwilson/nitinat
```

- More complicated than file upload
- But allows people to get the data:
  - With the code that manipulates it
  - Using tools they have to learn anyway

<div align="center">
  <p>
    <img src="../files/cran.png" alt="CRAN logo" width="20%" /></a>
    &nbsp;
    <img src="../files/pypi.svg" alt="PyPI logo" width="20%" /></a>
  </p>
</div>

## Regression

- Jess's supervisor takes on an undergraduate intern named Ren to help with data cleaning
- Every change Ren makes works for the file he's looking at…
- …but breaks processing of some other file

<div align="center">
  <p>
    <img src="../files/ren.svg" alt="Ren Avatar" width="30%" /></a>
  </p>
</div>

- Don't be Ren

---

## Testing

- Jess starts adding tests with [pytest][pytest] to the data cleaning project
- Creates small input files, each containing one problem
  - Test that the software reads and fixes the ones it's supposed to
  - And that it actually fails when it's supposed to
- *Testing accelerates development*

<div align="center">
  <p>
    <img src="../files/pytest.png" alt="pytest logo" width="20%" /></a>
  </p>
</div>

---

## Where Do Tests Come From?

1. Working backward from failures
  - Jess creates a reproducible example (reprex) each time the code fails
  - Throw away input until the problem goes away
  - Then undo the last change
2. Working forward from code
  - The [coverage][coverage] module shows which lines of code aren't tested
  - Jess constructs tests to reach untested lines
  - Coincidentally reveals some code that is no longer needed

---

## Design for Test

- Some code is hard to reach with tests
  - Or requires thirty lines of setup for a two-line test
- Both are signs that the code isn't modular
  - And will be hard to fix or extend in future
- So Jess refactors the code so that parts aren't as tightly coupled

  <p>
    <img src="../files/maze.svg" alt="maze" width="30%" /></a>

</div>

## Taschuk's Rules

- Also cleans up according to [<a href="../bibliography/#Taschuk2017">Taschuk2017</a>]
  - Adds command-line argument handling
  - Eliminates hard-coded paths
- Starts linting the code with [black][black], [flake8][flake8], and [isort][isort]
  - Forestalls a lot of <strike>argument</strike> discussion about coding style
- Does *not* write comprehensive documentation (yet)
  - Still too early to know whether it will pay off
  - "Documentation, like research, mostly goes unread."

## What Can Reasonably Go Wrong?

- We knew something like COVID-19 was bound to happen eventually
  - Lots of people told us how to prepare
  - And those preparations would have made daily life better before the pandemic hit
- We can predict some of the major changes that will happen to research software projects
  - Preparing for them now makes life better right away

---

## Things Are Going Well…

- Jess and Tahia publish two papers about the data
  - Add a `CITATION.cff` file to the repository
- Start to get email from other researchers
  - "How can I get your data?"
  - "Please add feature X so that I can clean up my data too"
- Jess belatedly starts a blog
  - [Bewildering variety of tools][jamstack]
  - Eventually settles on [Hugo][hugo]
  - Hosted on [GitHub Pages][github-pages]

<div align="center">
  <p>
    <img src="../files/hugo.svg" alt="Hugo logo" width="20%" /></a>
  </p>
</div>

---

## …And Then It Happens

- Jess completes their PhD and starts working at a government lab rewriting their simulation
  - No longer has time for the data cleanup project
  - Agree that Tahia will become its lead
- At this point Jess discovers that:
  - Project and personal communication are tangled up in their email
  - They do a _lot_ of things that they're not really conscious of doing

## Where You Don't Want to Be

<div align="center" style="margin-top: 10ex;">
  "<a href="https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/7351#issuecomment-1068956346">It seems quite crazy that the owner of the domain
    <br/>
    seems to be completely unknown to maintainers…</a>"
</div>

---

## Communication

- Register a domain name for the project
  - Still use Hugo to build the site and GitHub Pages to host it
- Create an `admin@` account on that domain
  - Takes months to train people to send mail to it instead of directly to Jess

---

## Discussion

- Create a mailing list for discussion
  - Debate using Slack and Discourse
  - Eventually agree they're already being interrupted too often

<div align="center">
  <p>
    <img src="../files/slack.svg" alt="Slack logo" width="20%" /></a>
    <img src="../files/discourse.svg" alt="Discourse logo" width="20%" /></a>
  </p>
</div>

- List is moderated
  - 0.1% of Reddit users generate 38% of attacks on others
  - 1% accounts for 74% of attacks [<a href="../bibliography/#Kumar2018">Kumar2018</a>]

---

## Code of Conduct

- Add a Code of Conduct to the repository
- Luckily, do this *before* announcing the handover
  - One contributor strongly objects to Tahia becoming project lead
  - Comments become very personal
  - Having CoC in place allows them to ban the person without being accused of personal animosity

---

## Checklists

- Jess (finally) starts creating checklists
- Each one is a Markdown file in the project's Git repository
  - Copy and paste into an issue each time the task needs to be done

<div align="center">
  <p>
    <img src="../files/checklist.svg" alt="Checklist" width="30%"/>
  </p>
</div>

---

## Passwords

- Also starts using a password manager
  - Allows them to share credentials with Tahia
  - And gives them a bit of protection from the disgruntled ex-contributor

<div align="center">
  <p>
    <img src="../files/bitwarden.svg" alt="BitWarden logo" width="25%"/>
    <img src="../files/1password.svg" alt="1password logo" width="25%"/>
    <img src="../files/lastpass.svg" alt="LastPass logo" width="25%"/>
  </p>
</div>

<p class="highlight">
  Please see [<a href="../bibliography/#Smalls2021">Smalls2021</a>] for other steps you should take <em>right now</em>.

## Roles and Responsibilities

- A systematic way to create checklists

<div align="center">
  <table class="small">
    <tr>
      <th>Person</th>
      <th>Roles</th>
      <td rowspan="2"></td>
      <th>Role</th>
      <th>Task</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ghopper</td>
      <td>admin</td>
      <td>admin</td>
      <td>merge PRs</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>kjohnson</td>
      <td>admin, commit</td>
      <td align="center">×</td>
      <td>admin</td>
      <td>assign issues</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>aturing</td>
      <td>commit</td>
      <td rowspan="2"></td>
      <td>commit</td>
      <td>publish posts</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>bwk</td>
      <td>commit</td>
      <td>commit</td>
      <td>file issues</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

- Gives you a list of what actually needs to be done
  - It's always longer than you first expect
- Tells everyone who to go to for what
  - Particularly when their first choice is on holiday
- Helps with succession planning
  - "We don't have anyone who does that any more…"
