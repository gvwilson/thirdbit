## Recalibrating

- Jess now needs to redefine "productive"

1. What do we need?
   - And who is "we", exactly?
2. How are we going to build it?
3. What *aren't* we going to build?
4. Who's going to do the work?
5. How will people know?

## Marketing

> Making sure that the people who ought to know
> how you can make their lives better
> actually do know.

- If what you offer isn't actually useful, this relies on psychological tricks
  - Manufacturing desire
- If what you offer *is* useful, the challenges are:
  1. Thinking like someone else
  2. Being heard above the noise
- Your actual product is your grant proposals [<a href="../bibliography/#Kuchner2011">Kuchner2011</a>]
  - That's what people give you money for
- Your papers are "just" proof that you're worth funding
  - Because funders have a signal-to-noise problem too

---

## You Are Not Your Users

- Person writing a paper:
  - Are the error bars right?
  - Do my co-authors agree with the conclusions?
  - Will this be accepted before someone else gets the same result?
- Person reading a paper:
  - Did the authors cite my work?
  - Does this paper support my current research direction?
  - Can I use their data or software to speed up my work?

## Personas

A made-up surrogate for part of your community

> Dalha, 58, is a professor in geophysics and the Dean of Science at Euphoric State University.
> She is evaluated annually on (a) how many high-citation publications faculty produce,
> (b) whether research funding is increasing year-on-year, and
> (c) how many of the university's PhD graduates are offered tenure-stream positions at top-10 schools.
> Dalha is passionate about getting more young women into STEM,
> and worried by the number of faculty and grad students
> who are leaving the university for industry.
