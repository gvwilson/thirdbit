## Hiring

- Different from <a href="../newcomers/">recruiting new contributors</a>
  - Though what you do once someone is hired may be very similar
- People do lots of simple things wrong [<a href="../bibliography/#Behroozi2020">Behroozi2020</a>]
- Ask Human Resources for mentoring
- *Always post positions*
  - One person's "I know a guy" is another's "I wasn't even invited"

---

## 1. Legal requirements

- Every jurisdiction has rules about hiring people
- Institutions often have union agreements or contractual obligations
- Jess talks to Aaron in Human Resources *before doing anything else*
  - Even if you've gone through this before, rules can change

<div align="center">
  <p>
    <img src="../files/jess.svg" alt="Jess Avatar" width="20%" style="vertical-align: text-top;"/>
    <img src="../files/conversation.svg" alt="Conversation" width="20%" style="vertical-align: text-top;"/>
    <img src="../files/aaron.svg" alt="Aaron Avatar" width="20%" style="vertical-align: text-top;"/>
  </p>
</div>

---

## 2. Contact

- Pay attention to details
  - Do they have or need work authorization?
  - Are they willing to relocate?
  - Do they actually have the right skills for this job?

<div align="center">
  <p><em>Please <a href="../hr/programmer-competency-matrix/">explain your classification</a>.</em></p>
</div>

- Responsiveness
  - Acknowledge all communication
  - Give them timelines (and updates when timelines change)

---

## 3. Preparation

- Interview scheduling
  - Use [Calendly][calendly] or a similar service
  - If you have to reschedule, give candidates several days' notice
  - If you have to reschedule twice, you're telling them you don't want them
- Hiring criteria
  - Describe the process and the kinds of questions they'll be asked
- [Automattic][automattic-hiring] is a good model
- [Canonical][canonical-hiring] is not

<div align="center">
  <p>
    <img src="../files/calendly.jpg" alt="Calendly logo" width="40%"/>
  </p>
</div>

---

## 4. Interviews

- Make sure interviewers stick to the advertised process
  - Role-play a practice interview if you can
- Interviewers' knowledge
  - If you don't know enough to judge the candidate, find someone who can
- Make sure they pay attention (rather than answering email)

---

## 5. Hearing back

- Status updates
  - Give candidates a timeline and regular updates
  - Don't try to hide the fact that you're interviewing other people
- Give feedback *if the interviewee asks for it*
  - "You're on the right track, but need to have more experience with time series data"

---

## 6. Offer and negotiation

- Let Human Resources handle this

<div align="center">
  <p>
    <img src="../files/jess.svg" alt="Jess Avatar" width="15%" style="vertical-align: text-top;"/>
    <img src="../files/conversation.svg" alt="Conversation" width="15%" style="vertical-align: text-top;"/>
    <img src="../files/aaron.svg" alt="Aaron Avatar" width="15%" style="vertical-align: text-top;"/>
    <img src="../files/conversation.svg" alt="Conversation" width="15%" style="vertical-align: text-top;"/>
    <img src="../files/silvia.svg" alt="Silvia Avatar" width="15%" style="vertical-align: text-top;"/>
  </p>
</div>

- You *did* publish a salary band, right?

## Firing

- Sometimes people have good reasons for poor performance
- Sometimes they don't
- This is the hardest part of leading a project
- But keeping someone on the team who shouldn't be there is bad for morale as well as productivity

---

## 1. Legal Requirements

- Every jurisdiction has rules about firing people, too
- Again, talk to someone in Human Resources before doing anything else

<div align="center">
  <p>
    <img src="../files/jess.svg" alt="Jess Avatar" width="20%" style="vertical-align: text-top;"/>
    <img src="../files/conversation.svg" alt="Conversation" width="20%" style="vertical-align: text-top;"/>
    <img src="../files/aaron.svg" alt="Aaron Avatar" width="20%" style="vertical-align: text-top;"/>
  </p>
</div>

---

## 1. "Legal" Requirements

- <a href="../governance/">Governance</a> of every well-run open project spells out:
  - Criteria for being a project member
  - Who gets to decide when that privilege is revoked
- *You can't wait until you need these to write them*
- Review them before going any further

---

## 2. Check With Someone

- Hard to work with someone you dislike
  - But not liking someone isn't sufficient reason to fire them
- Talk to someone outside the project
  - More likely to be objective
  - Less likely to let something slip
  - Less likely to feel pressured to take your side because you're the boss

---

## 3. Create a Transition Plan

- It's awkward to fire the only person who knows the password to the production server
  - And risky as well
- Suddenly asking someone to document their work is a give-away
- Better to ask everyone to do it all the time
  - Which helps keep roles and responsibilities up to date

<div align="center">
  <p>
    <img src="../files/checklist.svg" alt="Checklist" width="30%"/>
  </p>
</div>

---

## 3. Create a Transition Plan

- Write out the steps you'll take immediately after breaking the news
  - Change passwords on servers
  - Remove from GitHub group
  - Remove from mailing list
  - Return loaned hardware
- All of this needs to be done when someone leaves voluntarily
  - And helps you realize just how much "stuff" your project has

---

## 4. No Surprises

- If someone is surprised they're being fired, *you* have made a mistake
- If it's for poor behavior:
  - They should know what's in the Code of Conduct
  - And you should have given them warnings for minor violations
- If it's for poor performance:
  - You should have told them that they weren't meeting expectations…
  - …given them a chance to explain…
  - …and given them an opportunity to improve
- You will feel pretty bad if they've been missing deadlines because of a family illness

---

## 5. Delivery

- Write out what you're going to say
  - Keep it short
- Practice it a few times
- Then get straight to the point
- Don't get drawn into discussion of "what if"
- Stick to the practical matters you identified in the transition plan

---

## 6. Tell the Team

- Make sure the team hears the news from you
  - Before rumors start to circulate
- Keep statement brief and to the point
- Do *not* discuss details
  - The person you fired has a right to privacy
  - And you don't want other team members worrying that you'll say something about them some day

---

## 7. Keep a Record

- It's hard for people to think clearly when you're angry or hurt
  - And they may not act in good faith
- Communicate by email
- If they insist on a call:
  - Ask to record it and give them permission to do the same
  - Or have a third party present

## It's OK to Cry

- This is the hardest part of management
- Many of the other things we've discussed are to prevent it being necessary
- "You can't save everyone."

---

## In Between

- Regular performance reviews
  - At which *you* bring up salary
- Career development plans
  - "Where do you want to be in two years?"
  - "How can I help you get there?"

---

## Giving Feedback

- Structure makes difficult conversations less difficult

<table>
  <tr><th colspan="4">COIN</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Context</td><td>What you want to discuss and why</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Observation</td><td>Specific, factual description of what happened</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Impact</td><td>How the issue affects others in the team</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Next Steps</td><td>A clear agreement on the changes</td></tr>
</table>
