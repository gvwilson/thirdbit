I was born in 1963 and grew up on [Vancouver Island][lake-cowichan],
where two inches of rain is considered a light shower.
I completed a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Engineering at [Queen's University][queens] in 1984,
then worked in Ottawa before moving to Edinburgh
to do a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence.
I spent the next six years working at the [Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre][epcc]
while doing a Ph.D. in Computer Science (which I completed in 1992)
and writing popular science articles for *The Independent* and [*New Scientist*][new-sci].

Over the next few years
I wrote and edited [my first few books]({{'/bib/' | relative_url}})
while doing post-doctoral work at several universities
and working at IBM, a data visualization startup, and Los Alamos National Laboratory.
I became involved in open source development, particularly Python,
and started playing the saxophone and Ultimate frisbee (though not simultaneously).
From 2000 to 2004 I was a contributing editor with *Doctor Dobb's Journal*
and part of a computer security startup that was eventually acquired by Hewlett-Packard.
I also published my first children's book and met the woman I'm married to,
and in 2007 we became the happy parents of a wonderful troublemaker.

I was a professor in [Computer Science][ut-cs]
at the [University of Toronto][ut] from 2007 to 2010,
during which time I helped create a [Master's degree in Applied Computing][mscac],
was named ComputerWorld Canada's "IT Educator of the Year",
and wrote some more books
(one of which, [*Beautiful Code*][bc], won a Jolt Award).

I left academia in 2010
and spent the next seven years building [Software Carpentry][carpentries] into
a worldwide volunteer organization that teaches basic computing skills to thousands of researchers every year.
Somewhere in there I found time to edit
[a book on evidence-based software engineering][making-software]
and the first two volumes of [*The Architecture of Open Source Applications*][aosabook].
After a short stint with [Rangle.io][rangle] in 2017 I joined DataCamp,
who I'm proud to say [fired me in 2018][datacamp].

More recently I spent two and a half years developing
an [instructor training and certification program][rstudio-trainers] for RStudio (now Posit)
and was briefly Head of Education for [Metabase][metabase]
before becoming a software engineering manager at [Deep Genomics][dg].
In my free time I helped build TidyBlocks and [Glosario][glosario]
and wrote or co-wrote [*Teaching Tech Together*][t3],
[*JavaScript for Data Science*][js4ds],
[*Research Software Engineering with Python*][rse-py],
and [*Software Design by Example*][sdxjs].
