*Update: congratulations to Tania Allard, KwonHan Bae, and Cristián Maureira-Fredes on being elected to the PSF Board.*

I have put myself forward as a candidate for election to the board of
the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/).
My pitch is below;
no matter what happens,
I hope I'll be able to continue to serve the community that has given me so much over so many years.

> Python has been an important part of my life for a quarter of a century,
> so I would be grateful for a chance to serve its community as a member of the PSF board.
> I believe my experience has prepared me for doing so effectively:
> I co-authored the PEP that added sets to the language,
> am a Fellow of the PSF,
> helped make Python the first-year teaching language at Canada's largest university,
> and have written several books showing how to apply it to real-world problems.
>
> I also launched and then led a non-profit organization called Software Carpentry
> that now has thousands of instructors running workshops on basic computing skills in dozens of countries.
> Building that gave me first-hand experience of the challenges that non-profit organizations face;
> I hope that what I learned about fundraising, governance, community management, committee work,
> and managing changes in leadership
> will allow me to contribute to the PSF in meaningful ways.
>
> My other reason for nominating myself is that I don't like to leave things half-done.
> The first generation of open source contributors proved that
> volunteers working together can create world-class infrastructure and tools,
> but we are still struggling to make such work a viable career.
> Many people struggle to balance their desire to contribute with their need to pay their bills,
> while other simply burn out.
> If elected,
> I hope to help the PSF take the lead in tackling the sustainability crisis,
> and by doing so,
> help ensure that the Python community grows and thrives.
