Short version:
I want something like [Scratch][scratch] for the social sciences—not
a tool to teach programming to social scientists,
but something to teach the social sciences to programmers.

Long version:
Scratch is the most successful "learn to program" tool ever created.
Its block-based interface allows people of all ages
to learn about loops, conditionals, and other fundamental programming concepts
*without* [inessential weirdness][weirdness] making them feel lost or stupid.
What's more,
people who teach Scratch go out of their way to make novices feel like they belong.

What exists for teaching economics, sociology, history[^1], and the like
to programmers who know as little about those subjects
as a typical anthropology major knows about CSS or JavaScript?

1.  Undergrad textbooks don't work for this audience
    for the same reason that
    undergraduate computer science textbooks are a mis-fit
    for librarians who want to learn a little coding.

2.  Most books written by academics for laypeople
    assume background knowledge that my audience doesn't have.
    I've given copies of [*Twitter and Tear Gas*][teargas]
    and [*So You Want to Talk About Race*][race] to colleagues
    who want to learn more about these issues.
    It hasn't gone well,
    but that's no reflection on either the authors or the readers:
    it's just the same kind of mis-match I see
    when programmers teaching programming to non-programmers
    assume that everyone knows what an operating system is.

3.  Most other books I've found are exhortations rather than explanations,
    or split hairs that my audience don't even know exist.

Part of the problem,
I think,
is that experts are often condescending or unforgiving
when someone simplifies things in order to make them more accessible.
When I sent out drafts of [*Teaching Tech Together*][t3] to early reviewers,
for example,
one senior professor's response was,
"You have either not read or not understood the papers you cite."
I thought about replying with,
"I have—I'm just writing for a general audience rather than doctoral students,"
but I don't think they would have accepted that as valid.

So:
what do you know of for teaching and/or learning the social sciences
that is,
like Scratch,
consciously designed to be accessible to people with zero background knowledge
*and* is supported by a community that helps those people *as they are*?
Pointers or introductions would be very welcome.
