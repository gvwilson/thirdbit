Thirty-one years ago
I was teaching high performance computing to a mix of graduate and senior undergraduate students.
There were twenty students in the class—nineteen men and one woman—and
while there were a lot of bumps and false starts,
I thought it was going pretty well.

Most people reading this are probably too young to remember,
but that year was when the World-Wide Web really took off.
All of a sudden people had access to a browser for the first time
and were discovering that there were pages and pages and *pages* out there
on every conceivable topic,
and that if you clicked on a link you would find even more.

So one Saturday night in February I was in the computing lab
trying to make sure that the assignment I was going to hand out that week actually worked,
and over in the corner three young men had just discovered that
there is pornography on the internet.
They would click a link,
wait a few seconds for an image to download,
say the sorts of things young men say about such images,
and then click the next link.
I tuned them out,
finished what I was doing,
and went home.

When I got to work on Monday
there was a note in my mailslot
(yes, an actual piece of paper—remember, this was thirty years ago)
informing me that the one female student in my class was dropping my class:
in fact,
she was dropping Computer Science entirely and switching to Math.
I was puzzled—she had seemed to be enjoying the class—but
I didn't think any more of it.

A week and a half later,
though,
I bumped into her as I was walking across campus
and I asked her why she had dropped out.
She hemmed and hawed a bit,
then said,
"You probably don't remember this, but…"
and reminded me about the three young men in the CS lab.
I shrugged and said something like,
"Well, you know, assholes exist—sometimes we just have to put up with them,"
and she said,
"You don't understand.
I was the only woman in the lab that night
and you were the only faculty member and you didn't say anything to them,
and I don't think I should have to put up with *you*."

I apologized,
of course,
and I'd like to think that I've done better since,
but thirty-one years later,
I can still sometimes hear the hurt and anger in her voice.

Time to make another cup of tea.
If you came in peace, be welcome;
if not, be damned with you.
