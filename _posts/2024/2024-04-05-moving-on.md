Today was my last day at Deep Genomics.
As I said [earlier][sdxpy_parse],
I'm going to spend three weeks working on [some][sql_tutorial] [side][sys_tutorial] [projects][rsdx]
and then start work at [Plotly][plotly] on April 29.
I learned a lot at DG,
and am grateful to everyone who took the time to teach me.
