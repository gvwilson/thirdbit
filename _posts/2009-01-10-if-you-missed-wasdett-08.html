If you missed the Workshop on Advanced Software Development Tools and Techniques held last July (I did---didn't even know it existed 'til December), there's a <a href="http://smallwiki.unibe.ch/wasdett2008/">summary page</a> with some interesting links.  (See also <a href="http://gcn.com/Articles/2008/12/29/Livermore-Lab-pioneers-debugging-tool.aspx">this post</a> about a stack analysis debugging tool developed at Livermore that collapses similar process states together to reduce the cognitive load on people programming massively parallel machines.)
