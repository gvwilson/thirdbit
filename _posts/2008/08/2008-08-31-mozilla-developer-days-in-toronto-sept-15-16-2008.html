Via David Humphrey: a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/DeveloperDays/TorontoSept2008">two-day workshop</a> on developing for and with Mozilla will be held at Seneca College in Toronto on September 15-16, 2008.  The first day is meant for non-Mozilla devs who want to see how they can leverage the platform, contribute, or otherwise learn about Mozilla tech for their projects; the second day is more for current Moz devs and is focused on testing strategies.  The event is free, and people can sign-up at <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/DeveloperDays/TorontoSept2008">https://wiki.mozilla.org/DeveloperDays/TorontoSept2008</a>.
