We're hoping to release a new version of DrProject next week, and persuade some <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org">Trac</a> users to upgrade.  (Multiple projects!  Mailing lists!  Role-based access control!  Scripting interface!)  This is therefore a good time to take a fresh look at what other systems offer:

<a href="http://www.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>: not the first web-based software project portal, but certainly the best known and (probably) the most widely used; not free, and too big for most student projects and startups (though there are lots of cases of both using it).

<a href="http://code.google.com/hosting/">Google Code</a>: much smaller, but growing fast; only available as a hosted service (which rules it out for course projects in many jurisdictions, and for companies that want to keep their software behind their firewall).

<a href="http://trac.edgewall.org">Trac</a>: probably the most popular entry-level open source system; this is what we forked DrProject from, and what we're hoping to supercede.

<a href="http://studios.thoughtworks.com/mingle-project-intelligence">Mingle</a>: a relatively new offering from <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a> specifically aimed at agile projects (and lovers of sticky notes everywhere). Very attractive, but not open.

<a href="http://www.rallydevelopment.com/">Rally</a>, <a href="http://www.versionone.com/">VersionOne</a>, <a href="http://www.scrumworks.com/">ScrumWorks</a>, <a href="http://www.targetprocess.com/">TargetProcess</a>, and <a href="http://www.acunote.com/promo">Acunote</a>: same story as <a href="http://studios.thoughtworks.com/mingle-project-intelligence">Mingle</a>.

<a href="http://openproj.org/">OpenProj</a>: an open source alternative to Microsoft Project, available both on the desktop and as a service.

<a href="http://www.xplanner.org/">XPlanner</a>,  <a href="http://www.extremeplanner.com/">ExtremePlanner</a>, <a href="http://www.projectcards.com/">ProjectCards</a>, <a href="http://www.xpstorystudio.com/">XPStoryStudio</a>, <a href="http://www.planningpoker.com/">PlanningPoker</a>, and <a href="http://www.nordija.com/en/Products/planB.html">Plan B</a>: all target agile processes, but lack some or all of the features of an all-purpose portal.

<a href="http://www.perforce.com">Perforce</a>: my favorite version control system, which also has simple task management, but not the rest of the features a team needs in a portal.

<a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/awdtools/clearcase/">ClearCase</a>: a configuration management tool rather than a portal; definitely <em>not</em> something to inflict on a small team (or a large one, for that matter).

<a href="http://www.jazz.net">Jazz</a>: "an <a href="http://www.ibm.com/software/rational/jazz/">IBM Rational</a> project to build a scalable, 								extensible team collaboration platform for integrating work across the 								phases of the development lifecycle."  Slightly smaller than Greenland, and not yet finished; definitely <em>not</em> for student teams.

So, what have I missed?
