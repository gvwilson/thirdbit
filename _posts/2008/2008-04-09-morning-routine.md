<ol>
	<li>Log in to my desktop Windows box.</li>
	<li>Start a script that does "svn up" in all the repositories I care about (currently 40+, as I'm watching a lot of student projects).</li>
	<li>Start up Thunderbird (it takes a while to load).</li>
	<li>Log in to Google Calendar to see what my day looks like.</li>
	<li>Do a quick pass through email (typically 50-60 non-spam messages overnight): everything is skimmed and either deleted or moved to my "action" folder.</li>
	<li>Check the output of the "svn up" script to see if there's anything I should worry about.</li>
	<li>Log in to this blog to approve or delete comments.</li>
	<li>Check Google Reader to see what the rest of the world is doing.</li>
	<li>Log in to Facebook to check on my Scrabulous games.  (It's a drug...)</li>
	<li>Go through my "action" folder from the top; if possible, deal with one holdover issue before tackling any of today's.  (This morning, for example, I booked a flight to Quebec City.)</li>
	<li>Make up a sticky-note-sized list of things I need to do today (some taken from the "action" folder, some not).</li>
</ol>
If I'm in at 8:15, this is done by 9:00, and I'm ready to face my day.  What's <em>your</em> routine?
