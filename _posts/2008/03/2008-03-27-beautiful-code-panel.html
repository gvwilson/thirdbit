Jon Erickson has posted a <a href="http://www.dobbscodetalk.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=218&amp;Itemid=">video clip</a> from the <a href="http://beautifulcode.oreillynet.com/"><em>Beautiful Code</em></a> panel held at SD West a couple of weeks ago.  Michael Feathers, Jim Kent, Christopher Seiwald, Elliotte Harold, Ron Mak, and Alberto Savoia were there; wish I could have been too.

Later: the <a href="http://dobbscodetalk.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=248">second installment</a> is up now too.

Still later: the <a href="http://www.dobbscodetalk.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=306&amp;Itemid=">third installment</a> is up as well.
