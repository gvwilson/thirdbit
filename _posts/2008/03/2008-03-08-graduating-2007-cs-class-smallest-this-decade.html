According to <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9066659">an article in Computerworld</a>, 2007's graduating classes in Computer Science were the smallest this decade: roughly half the size of the 2003-04 peak.  However, new enrolments were slightly up over the previous year, so classes may start to grow again.
