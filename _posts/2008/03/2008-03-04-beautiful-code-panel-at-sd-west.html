<a href="http://www.ddj.com">DDJ</a>'s Jon Erickson <a href="http://www.ddj.com/blog/portal/archives/2008/03/sd_west_2008_un.html">blogs</a> about last night's <a href="http://beautifulcode.oreillynet.com/"><em>Beautiful Code</em></a> panel session at <a href="http://www.sdexpo.com/">SD West</a>.  I wish I could have been there --- I've gotten to know several of the authors well, but have never actually met them in person.
