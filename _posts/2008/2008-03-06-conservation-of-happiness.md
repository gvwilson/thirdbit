Two messages below the announcement that <em>Beautiful Code</em> had won a Jolt award was a rejection notice from Google---it seems that exploring ways to integrate new technologies into software project portals like <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a>, <a href="http://www.sf.net">SourceForge</a>, and <a href="http://code.google.com/hosting/">Google Code</a> "...could not fit any of the research directions that Google is currently exploring".  At least they were only two months late telling me... :-(
