Kosta has posted some more thoughts about integrating IRC into DrProject. He's still working on mechanisms, but I'm looking ahead to the user interface. In particular, how should IRC logs be displayed? His first pass will be a "magic" wiki page that conversation entries are appended to (or possibly one separate "magic" page for each IRC conversation topic).  That will work for short projects, but:
<ol>
	<li>What happens with something like DrProject itself, which could have tens of thousands of lines of conversation after a year has gone by? Even in undergrad course projects, there are likely to be thousands of lines in a term. Email is naturally segmented into chunks; what is the chunking (if any) for chat?</li>
	<li>What happens to the event log? We clearly don't want one entry in the log for each IRC chat message---what should we show instead?</li>
</ol>
Thoughts?
