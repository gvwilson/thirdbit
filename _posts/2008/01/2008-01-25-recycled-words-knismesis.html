In keeping with today's spirit of re-using and recycling wherever possible, I would like to propose that the word "knismesis" be redefined, so that instead of meaning "light tickling", it means "that slightly disoriented feeling of having invaded someone else's personal space you get when faced with their keyboard bindings, GMail configuration, and other e-preferences".  The adjectival form is "knismetic"; the l33t form is, "Ew, I've been knizzed" or "Ew, that's *so* knizzy..."

You heard it here first...
