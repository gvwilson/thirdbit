I'm supposed to spend 9-10 every morning getting my programming skills back up to par. Instead, I have become a mail relay.  Here's a count of messages sent on business matters (not including stuff I did for <a href="http://www.ddj.com"><em>DDJ</em></a> or <a href="http://beautifulcode.oreillynet.com/"><em>Beautiful Code</em></a>, or personal email) in the past couple of years:

I don't have stats on mail I've <em>read</em>, but the counts are probably 10 times higher. *sigh*
