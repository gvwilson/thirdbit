From <a href="http://glinden.blogspot.com/">Greg Linden</a>, via <a href="http://adam.goucher.ca/">Adam Goucher</a>, comes a reference to a paper by Benjamin Livshits and Emre Kiciman of Microsoft Research. "<a href="ftp://ftp.research.microsoft.com/pub/tr/TR-2007-159.pdf">Doloto: Code Splitting for Network-Bound Web 2.0 Applications</a>" describes an automatic mechanism for splitting and stubbing Javascript, so that only the bits the page really needs are downloaded right away.  As Web 2.0 apps get fatter and fatter, this kind of "just in time assembly" will matter more and more---sort of like on-demand loading of dynamic libraries started to matter for desktop performance about fifteen years ago ;-). It would have made the <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/1309.html">trick</a> <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/1316.html">Alex</a> <a href="https://stanley.cdf.toronto.edu/drproject/csc49x/DrProject/wiki/HowToMakeDojoFaster">showed us</a> for <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a> unnecessary.
