Today, the students in my CSC491 project course gave their end-of-term demos. Each team had 10 minutes to present their work to a mixed audience of students, faculty, and visitors from industry.  It went very well---their talks were clear, their demos ran smoothly, and they handled questions well.  For the record, we heard from:
<ul>
	<li>Mike Conley and Geofrey Flores, who are rebuilding OLM on top of Ruby on Rails;</li>
	<li>Fan Dong, who benchmarked the usability of three scientific workflow packages (Taverna, LONI, and Kepler);</li>
	<li>Justin Foong, Vladimir Markin, and Teren Teh, who integrated Mozilla's Ubiquity natural language interface into Thunderbird;</li>
	<li>AJ Guillon, who is building a mixed task- and data-parallel library for GPU programming;</li>
	<li>Lenny Han and Can Zhang, who extended the Eclipse feature diagram plugin to create a WYSIWYG graphical refactoring tool;</li>
	<li>Mohammad Jalali and Darren Jung, who extend the FlareFlow visual database query builder (and did some usability testing to see if their extensions actually made life easier);</li>
	<li>Eddie Kang and Ben Kim, who created two graph layout plugins for a bioinformatics tool called Navigator;</li>
	<li>Denis Pankratov and Jennifer Ruttan, who have been banging their heads against a wall of undocumented and/or flaky CDMA phone software;</li>
	<li>Miles Thibault, who put together a business plan for a screen writing site; and</li>
	<li>Kosta Zabashta, who built the mail and search components for our rewrite of DrProject on Django.</li>
</ul>
I'm really proud to have worked with them---they deserved all the applause they got.
