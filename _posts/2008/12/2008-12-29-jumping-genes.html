Several people have created family trees to trace the evolution of programming languages (see, for example, the <a href="http://www.digibarn.com/collections/posters/tongues/tongues.jpg">Mother Tongues</a> chart). Given the news that <a href="http://www.mikeash.com/?page=pyblog/friday-qa-2008-12-26.html">closures are being added to Objective-C</a>, I'd like to see someone trace the <em>ideas</em> that make up programming languages, such as user-defined data types, generators, forall constructs, and so on. These seem to me to be like "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping_Genes">jumping genes</a>" (more properly called "transposons") that can move from one organism to another. Maybe UPL (the Ultimate Programming Language) isn't going to evolve; maybe it's going to accrete...
