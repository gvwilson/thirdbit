Steve Souders, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Web-Sites-Essential/dp/0596529309"><em>High Performance Web Sites</em></a>, is now teaching <a href="http://cs193h.stevesouders.com/">a course on the subject</a> at Stanford. Guest lecturers are from Plaxo, Google, Netflix, and Yahoo; the class project is to improve the performance of a top-100 web site. *sigh* I'm jealous...
