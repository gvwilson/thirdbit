<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2008/081216/full/news.2008.1312.html">Interesting piece from <em>Nature News</em></a>: "Anyone submitting to a section of the journal <span class="i">RNA Biology</span> will, in the future, be required to also submit a Wikipedia page that summarizes the work. The journal will then peer review the page before publishing it in Wikipedia."
