<a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2008/12/15/the-evolution-of-the-face-a-letter-to-some-readers-in-tennessee/">Great post</a> from Carl Zimmer: after writing an article about the evolution of the human face, he received a slew of letters of letters from creationists in Tennessee (pretty clearly coordinated by someone).  His reply is an excellent summary of the evidence for evolution, and an even better example of how to speak truth to nonsense.
