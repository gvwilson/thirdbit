I received an announcement yesterday for a graduate student consortium at <a href="http://vlhcc08.cs.unibw.de/">VL/HCC'08</a> on "Expanding the Benefits of Computational Thinking to Diverse Populations".  The goal is worthy:
<blockquote>...people are increasingly relying on computing and       information systems for leisure and home activities...it is no longer sufficient to consume the packaged software and scripted       tasks developed by the professional software industry---many people now       must produce their own computational solutions to a wide variety of       problems, including spreadsheet models, web sites, educational media       and simulations, automated business procedures, and scientific       visualizations...Studies       suggest that [such] end-user programmers outnumber professional programmers       by more than four to one...Unfortunately, current advances toward computational thinking by end       users are not evenly distributed across all segments of the population.       Our society is rapidly evolving into two distinct classes: the "computation       haves" and the "computation have-nots." This class distinction becomes an       obvious barrier to the opportunities for the "have-nots" to advance in       terms of career and influence, both individually and in groups. One reason       for this divide is that very little information technology research is       aimed specifically at the needs of disadvantaged users. Furthermore, there       is virtually no research directed at computational problem-solving and       information manipulation by users in these groups.</blockquote>
However, I'm increasingly impatient with the term "computational thinking".  Jeannette Wing's <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/usr/wing/www/publications/Wing06.pdf">original paper</a> drew a lot of support, but I suspect that's because everyone is adopting the phrase to mean "whatever I was interested in anyway". In one of the breakout sessions at <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~gvwilson/articles/cise-will-not-learn-2008.pdf">a workshop at Microsoft last September</a>, for example, six of us tried to operationalize its meaning by coming up with quiz questions to determine if someone could think computationally or not.  It quickly became clear that we variously meant "can write simple programs", "can use desktop productivity tools effectively", "knows how the Internet works", "can break large problems down into smaller pieces", and so on.

I'd therefore like to bring that challenge to a wider audience. Rather than defining "computational thinking", I'd like you to give me an example of a question that someone could only answer if they were able to do it.  First prize is, well, until I have <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/1496.html">better luck with grants</a> you'll have to settle for my undying appreciation, but I'd be happy to buy you a beer as well.
