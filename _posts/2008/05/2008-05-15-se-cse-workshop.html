One of the downsides of being in Texas is that I couldn't attend the <a href="http://www.cse.msstate.edu/~SECSE08/index.htm">First International Workshop on Software Engineering for Computational Science and Engineering</a>, which was held at <a href="http://icse08.upb.de/">ICSE'08</a> in Leipzig this week.  Papers are <a href="http://www.cse.msstate.edu/~SECSE08/schedule.htm">here</a> (I'll be reading them on the flight home); they look interesting, but the biggest thing for me is the change in the workshop's name---it used to be "Software Engineering for High-Performance Computing Applications" (<a href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/se-hpcs2004/">2004</a>, <a href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/se-hpcs/Welcome.html">2005</a>, <a href="http://www.ctwatch.org/quarterly/archives/november-2006-a/">2006</a>, <a href="http://www.cse.msstate.edu/~SEHPC07/">2007</a>), and I'm hoping the change of name reflects a genuine broadening of focus.
