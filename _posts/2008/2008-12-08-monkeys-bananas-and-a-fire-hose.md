<a href="http://www.thenullpointer.net/blog/monkeys-cage-and-fire-hose">This story</a> has been repeated in so many places that it has to be an urban myth, but all good myths contain a grain of truth. I was reminded of that this morning, when I found the new U of T phonebook in my mailbox.  That's right, a printed-on-paper phonebook: cheap paper, but a glossy cover. I'm guessing at least $2 per copy to produce.  Multiply that by 5000 copies (I'll bet the real number is closer to double that), and double it again for human labor and recycling cost, and you've got 1/3 of a person's salary at a time when the university is facing a serious financial crunch, all for something  that would have been out of date even before the presses started rolling. *sigh*
