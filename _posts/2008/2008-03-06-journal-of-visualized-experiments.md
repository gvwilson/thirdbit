Student teams in my consulting course this term have to produce a three-minute video of their work by the end of term: a screencast demo, a recorded PowerPoint show with voiceover, or anything else that moves.  One reason I added this to the course is that video clips are fast becoming normal in industry: think of the number of product web sites that have short demos, or of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzj723LkRJY">the screencast that launched Rails</a>. A more powerful reason, though, is that other sciences are already doing it---in fact, the <a href="http://www.jove.com/"><em>Journal of Visualized Experiments</em></a> is devoted entirely to showing how biological experiments are actually done.  "The future is already here---it is just unevenly distributed."
