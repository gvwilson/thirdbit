A colleague is trying to expand the subset of SVG that <a href="http://haxe.org/">haxe</a> supports. A sticking point is how to approximate SVG's elliptical arcs with a sequence of quadratic Bezier curves. If you have a flair for numerical methods and would like to offer some help, please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@cs.toronto.edu">get in touch</a>: the pertinent part of the SVG spec is at:
