I had another reminder today of <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/1360.html">why I like to teach</a>.  I loaned a Ruby on Rails book to a student before Christmas; this morning, he sent me a link to the <a href="http://www.isaacezer.com/kanji/">kanji flash card game</a> he'd built.  Neat.
