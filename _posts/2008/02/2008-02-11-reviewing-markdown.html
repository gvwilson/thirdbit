I was talking to my <a href="https://stanley.cdf.toronto.edu/drproject/csc301-2008-01">software engineering class</a> about code reviews last week, while simultaneously thinking about how to <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/1356.html">replace the wiki parser</a> in <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a>.  Two birds one stone, I decided to review <a href="http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/">a wiki parser written in Python</a> and keep notes on what I was thinking as I went through it.  I've posted the result as a <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/pages/reviewing-markdown.html">separate page</a> on this web site; I'd be interested in comments and feedback.

<em>Later: Diomidis Spinellis posted <a href="http://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20041125/">a similar think-aloud</a> back in 2004 that's worth reading.</em>
