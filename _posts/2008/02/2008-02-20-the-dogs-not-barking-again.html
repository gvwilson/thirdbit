The US <a href="http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/">National Academy of Engineering</a>'s site is running a feature on "grand challenges in engineering". You get to vote for which you think is most important: better medicines, securing cyberspace, preventing nuclear terror, and eleven others.  Carbon sequestration is there; so is economical solar power and producing energy from fusion.  "Reducing emissions" is not listed---apparently, the idea of cutting back is still too politically sensitive. *sigh*
