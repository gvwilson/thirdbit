I finally got a summary of graduate students feedback on the consulting course I ran this past winter.  It was pretty good overall—on a scale of 1-5, the responses were:
<table>
<tr>
<td>How much background is required to successfully complete this course?</td>
<td>None</td>
<td>Lots</td>
<td>2.6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>How easy was it to obtain details/background needed to supplement the lecture material?</td>
<td>Easy</td>
<td>Hard</td>
<td>2.7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Did the term work increase your understanding of the material?</td>
<td>Not at all</td>
<td>Very much</td>
<td>4.3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The material was presented:</td>
<td>Too slowly</td>
<td>Too fast</td>
<td>3.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The material was:</td>
<td>Too broad</td>
<td>Too specialized</td>
<td>2.8</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Too light</td>
<td>Too heavy</td>
<td>3.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>

Advice to people who are considering the course in the future:
<ul>
  <li>If there's a project you're interested in or something you want to learn, this is a great way to spend time doing it and getting a course credit at the same time.</li>
  <li>Great course. Find a good project and give 'er.</li>
  <li>This course is what you make of it. You can mold the course in order to get out more of what you are interested in. I found this freedom great!</li>
  <li>Lots of projects to choose from.</li>
  <li>Good if you want some public speaking experience.</li>
  <li>This course is very good for undergraduate students. It will enhance their coding skills and give them a good opportunity to find a job (by linking them to people in industry). If you are a graduate student and your thesis involves building an application, it's a very good chance to pass a course as you are doing so.</li>
  <li>Great course. You will learn a lot, but make sure you make realistic estimates of how long everything will take, otherwise it will be too much work.</li>
</ul>
General Comments—Good
<ul>
  <li>Provides great insight into large project development.</li>
  <li>Lecturer was outstanding!</li>
  <li>Interesting discussions.</li>
  <li>You can do many different things (develop applications) in this course.</li>
  <li>Learn a lot; things you won't learn in any other course.</li>
  <li>Hands-on learning and real-world experience.</li>
</ul>
General Comments—Bad
<ul>
  <li>Very code intensive, not very appropriate for grad students if the project is irrelevant to their research.</li>
</ul>
I'm now looking for project ideas for students in the fall—if you're interested, please drop me a line.
