Spring has definitely started in Toronto—it's 23 degrees outside (yes, Celsius), and the sky is that slightly dusty blue that I always associate with hot dogs, frisbees, and sunburn. It helps put this week's rejections in perspective:
<ul>
  <li>NSERC turned down a proposal to study the usefulness of integrated IM, configurable ticketing, and continuous documentation in web-based software project portals.</li>
  <li>ITCDF (an internal program at U of T) turned down a proposal to see whether short screencasts (including ones contributed by students themselves) could take the place of conventional help pages.</li>
</ul>
Coming on top of NSERC's rejection of my Discovery grant (which would have looked at the impact of reverse test oracles on uptake of test-driven development) and Google's rejection of a proposal similar to the IM/ticketing/docs one I sent to NSERC, it's making me wonder if I've been hexed.  I know there's a lot of randomness in academic grant review procedures, but being 0 for 4 (or 5, if you count the initial submission of the big NSERC proposal) definitely hints at a pattern.

Oh well—it's still a sunny day out there, and in a couple of hours I get to go home and tickle my daughter's feet…
