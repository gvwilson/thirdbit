It's now 10:29 EST, and the room is fuller:
<ul>
  <li>Dave Wolever, Jeff Balogh, Dave Cooper, Luke Petrolekas, Blake Winton, and Adam Goucher are working on DrProject</li>
  <li>Martin Williams, Florian Shkurti, and Tony Yiu are working on OLM</li>
  <li>Yi Qing Sim is proofreading</li>
  <li>Pardis Beikzadeh is working on UTest</li>
  <li>David Chang is working on Flex (no sign of Ian "it's too eaaaarrrllly" Chan yet)</li>
  <li>Alan "Flaps" Rosenthal is doing tech support</li>
  <li>I'm fetching milk for coffee, and making sure the donuts get eaten</li>
</ul>
11:00: helps if all the tests are running <em>before</em> you start to merge.

11:50: DC has merged his RPC interface into trunk; all the tests that were passing before are still passing.

12:10: still no sign of Ian, but I just checked code into DrProject for the first time in more than a year.

14:15: Ian has showed up, Pardis has her VMs, Martin has a new Ubuntu, Blake has a password, Ian has showed up, and tickets are being closed.  Opened, too, thanks to Adam and his new crew, but we will not speak of that yet…

16:30: winding down—the major tickets for OLM have been closed, a double handful for DrProject are gone as well (but Yi Qing, Luke, and Adam have found more), and we have a reservation for Chinese food at 6:00.  It's been fun; looking forward to tomorrow.

Quote of the day: wireless is the new peanuts.

Pictures thanks to <a href="http://hyfen.net/">Andrew Louis</a> and David Wolever—thanks, guys.
