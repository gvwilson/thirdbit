0410: *whimper*

0545: OK, this is silly.  Starbuck's opened half an hour ago, the crazy guy shouting on the street is gone, it isn't raining, and I have grant proposals to write.

0615: I have found my shoe!

0745: Back from Starbucks; rain has started, but first draft of two-page proposal for follow-on work to Software Carpentry has been written, and I haven't misplaced any shoes.

1000: Spent an hour and a half with <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~campbell">Jennifer</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~reid">Karen</a> talking to Stephen Edwards about <a href="http://web-cat.cs.vt.edu/">Web-CAT</a>. It's very cool, and parts of OLM would complement it nicely.

1030: Session on  "Learning for Professionals" learning about the professional master's at Carnegie Mellon West, what new developers learn in their first year on the job (takeaway: most problems arise from inadequate communication skills), and parallel programming.

1200: Good discussion over lunch, followed by an hour of much-needed downtime.

1515: Another good discussion with <a href="http://west.cmu.edu/who_we_are/faculty_staff/?category=&amp;cid=1614697">Ray Bareiss</a> about the Master's in Software Engineering at Carnegie-Mellon West.

1815: Off to the <a href="http://www.rogue.com/locations-portland.html">Rogue Brewery</a> to hook up with <a href="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~jonathan/">Jonathan Schaeffer</a> and others.

2045: Back to the hotel---as good as the beer is (and it's <em>very</em> good), I need sleep more.
