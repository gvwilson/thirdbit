This year's <a href="http://www.meshconference.com/">Mesh Conference</a> is coming up fast: May 21-22, here in Toronto. To add to the fun, there's <a href="http://www.meshconference.com/meshu/">meshU</a>, "a one-day event of <span class="hl">12 focused workshops</span> in three streams (<span class="hl">design, development, management</span>) given by those who have earned their stripes in the startup game".  And the best news yet is that <a href="http://www.meshconference.com/blog/2008/04/21/mesh-meetup-and-meshu-student-tix/">a batch of student-priced tickets</a> have been released.  Get 'em while they're hot...
