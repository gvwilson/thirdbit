Bruce Schneier has written a <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/04/internet_censor.html">review</a> of a new book about internet censorship called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Access-Denied-Filtering-Information-Revolution/dp/0262541963"><em>Access Denied</em></a> that numbers the Citizen Lab's Ron Deibert among its editors. It's a thoughtful review; what I find particularly interesting is that it appeared in <a href="http://www.nature.com"><em>Nature</em></a>, the world's premier science journal.
