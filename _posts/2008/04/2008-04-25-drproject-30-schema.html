One of the ways I can tell that <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a> is getting better is that its database schema is getting cleaner.  I've posted earlier versions from <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/741.html">December 2006</a> (which was 1.0 something or other), <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/img/drproject-1.2-schema.jpg">Version 1.2</a> from early 2007, and <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/img/drproject-elixir-schema.jpg">the first Elixir-based version</a> from July 2007. Today's is much tidier, and I even know what most of the fields are for:

We have to add two or three new tables this summer, but I hope we'll be able to keep things at least this clean.
