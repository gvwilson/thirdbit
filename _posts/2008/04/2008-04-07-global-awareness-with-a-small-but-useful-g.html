Over at Nascent (a Nature blog), Ian Mulvany has <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2008/04/hashtags_a_scientific_use_case.html">described</a> how he and colleagues use Hashtags and Twitter to keep track of what's going on at a conference.  This is cool---anyone know of an academic Computer Science conference where something similar is done?
