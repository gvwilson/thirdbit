A year and a bit ago, I posted pictures of <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a>'s <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/741.html">database schema</a> and <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/830.html">architecture</a>. I'm happy with the former --- the only thing I'd do differently is make it larger and add comments (or change field names to be more descriptive) --- but the latter still bugs me.  It doesn't carry as much information as a napkin sketch of a user interface, much less an architectural blueprint.  I've looked at lots of books on software architecture (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Software-Architecture-Primer-John-Reekie/dp/0646458418">Reekie &amp; McAdam</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Essential-Software-Architecture-Ian-Gorton/dp/3540287132">Gorton</a> being my favorites), but I still haven't found a notation that seems like good value for time.  If you know of one, I'd welcome a pointer...
