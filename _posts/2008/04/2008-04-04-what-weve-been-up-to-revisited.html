On Wednesday April 9, from 1-3 pm, the students in my combined <a href="https://stanley.cdf.toronto.edu/drproject/consulting-2008-01">capstone/grad course</a> on software consulting will be giving demos of their term projects upstairs at <a href="http://maps.google.ca/maps?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;q=molly+bloom's&amp;near=Toronto,+ON&amp;fb=1&amp;cid=43658935,-79394717,3823213073697488722&amp;li=lmd&amp;ll=43.665264,-79.394674&amp;spn=0.025456,0.058365&amp;z=14&amp;om=0">Molly Bloom's</a> (191 College Street, Toronto).  If you'd like to see what they've been up to, you can check out this <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~gvwilson/consulting-showcase-2008.pdf">brochure</a>.  Everyone is welcome; the bar will be open, and there will be <em>no</em> karaoke.
