Google <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2008/04/announcing-accepted-student-proposals.html">announced</a> this year's <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008">Summer of Code</a> projects today.  I'm very pleased that six students from the <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a> were among the recipients:
<ul>
	<li>Matthew Basset / Hackystat: <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/hackystat/appinfo.html?csaid=615119FC73C5B169">Hackystat Sensor for Visual Studio Team Foundation Server</a></li>
	<li>Eran Henig / Python: <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/psf/appinfo.html?csaid=556B21592B571FB9">Python Plugin for Web-CAT</a></li>
	<li>Victoria Mui / GenMAPP: <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/genmapp/appinfo.html?csaid=90FE00341AE130FF">Automatic (Smart) Node and Edge Label Layout</a></li>
	<li>Wong I Wa / Hackystat: <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/hackystat/appinfo.html?csaid=1C78F6822087D826">Visualizing HackyStat Data Using Flare</a></li>
	<li>Qi Yang / Eclipse: <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/eclipse/appinfo.html?csaid=FAB3F61F2769D208">Web-CAT Grader Plugin for Eclipse</a></li>
	<li>Qiyu Zhu / Python: <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/psf/appinfo.html?csaid=F3275527417A78FB">        DrProject Web Administration Interface</a></li>
</ul>
Four students from other schools (Jeff Balogh, Luke Paireepinart, Daniel Servos, and Artem Yunusov) will be doing projects we're involved in, and of course there are our non-GSoC students:
<ul>
	<li>Nicole Allard and Dmitri Vassiliev will continue their work on the feature diagram plugin for Eclipse and browser plugins for SlashID respectively.</li>
	<li>Geofrey Flores and Kosta Zabashta have been awarded an NSERC USRA to study the usability and productivity of web-based and IDE-based grading tools (GF) and to integrate instant messaging into DrProject (KZ).</li>
	<li>Luke Petrolekas will be testing and documenting DrProject (and probably other projects as well).</li>
	<li>Nick Jamil will be doing miscellaneous DrProject development.</li>
	<li>Chris Maddison and Hardeep Singh are going to help beef up the Python multimedia libraries we use in first-year teaching thanks to an ITCDF grant.</li>
</ul>
Oh, and we mustn't forget the graduate students:
<ul>
	<li>Samira Abdi is using machine learning techniques to cluster events in project histories to make them easier to visualize.</li>
	<li>Jeremy Handcock is building tools to visualize software project histories (clustered and otherwise).</li>
	<li>Carolyn  MacLeod will be studying how novices use modeling tools like SPIN and Alloy to see if there are systematic patterns in the mistakes they make.</li>
</ul>
Me? I'm getting married (twice), helping Jennifer, Paul, and Jason finish off a CS1-in-Python textbook, and trying to find some funding. It promises to be a busy sixteen weeks...
