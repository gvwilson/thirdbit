The folks at <a href="http://www.oreilly.com">O'Reilly</a> sent me another royalty statement for <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596510046/"><em>Beautiful Code</em></a> a couple of days ago: sales have (unsurprisingly) leveled off, but we've still raised another $8.5K for <a href="http://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a>.  Better to light a candle...
