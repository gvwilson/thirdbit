I've been meaning to blog about this for a while: CBC Radio is posting most of its shows as podcasts at <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/podcasting/">http://www.cbc.ca/podcasting/</a>. Highlights for me include "<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/podcasting/index.html?newsandcurrent#ideas">The Best of Ideas</a>", "<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/podcasting/index.html?newsandcurrent#thinkaboutscience">How to Think About Science</a>", and "<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/podcasting/index.html?arts#talkingbooks">Talking Books</a>".  One recent entry is <a href="http://blog.marsdd.com/2008/06/09/%e2%80%9cgetting-to-mars%e2%80%9d-on-cbc-radio-this-week/">an interview with Dr. John Evans</a>, formerly of the innovative medical program at McMaster, and the founding chair of MaRS.  In a way, the web is turning radio into books: instead of being ephemeral, radio shows can now be permanent parts of the great conversation we call civilization.
