The one-year anniversary edition of the Toronto Girl Geeks Dinner is tomorrow night (Wednesday, June 25) --- see their site for <a href="http://www.torontogirlgeekdinners.ca/2008/05/next-toronto-girl-geek-dinner-is-june.html#links">details</a>. It's a great event for networking (or so I'm told); I'll try to do a better job next time about getting the word out...
