Sometimes I post links here because I think you'll be interested.  Sometimes I post them so that I can find them again. Either way, it's useful.
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://blog.lilyapp.org/">Lily</a> is a Firefox add-in that lets users create programs visually. It's pretty cool; I'm still wondering why nobody has built a spreadsheet-like interface for creating web mashups yet.</li>
	<li><a href="http://review-board.org/">Review Board</a> is a code review tool that's been getting some attention. I'd like to add review in some form to <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a> one day, so I'd be interested in experience reports.</li>
	<li>Flowing Mail offers <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2008/03/19/21-ways-to-visualize-and-explore-your-email-inbox/">21 ways to visualize your inbox</a>.</li>
	<li>Over at <em>Scientific American</em>, Mitchell Waldrop reports that <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=science-2-point-0-great-new-tool-or-great-risk">Web 2.0 could revolutionize science.  Or not</a>. You, the reader, get to collaborate with him in writing the article---and only a decade or so after wikis were invented.</li>
	<li>A new edition of Chabay and Sherwood's <a href="http://"><em>Matter &amp; Interactions</em></a> is out (in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Matter-Interactions-I-Modern-Mechanics/dp/0470108304">two</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Matter-Interactions-II-Electric-Magnetic/dp/0470108312">volumes</a>). The book uses <a href="http://www.vpython.org/">VPython</a> extensively; if anyone knows of an equally good book on computational biology (all of it, not just genomics), I'd welcome a pointer.</li>
	<li>Over at <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em>, Nicholas Carr wonders if <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200807/google">Google is making us stupid</a>. Coincidentally, Garrett and Danziger have just published a study showing that <a href="http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol13/issue1/garrett.html">people who utilize instant messaging frequently at work report being interrupted <em>less</em> frequently than non-users</a>.</li>
	<li>Yahoo! has published some <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/parent.php?pattern=reputation">reputation management design patterns</a>. Would someone please do this for identity management?</li>
	<li>And in a comment on an earlier post, Gael Varoquaux pointed me at the <a href="http://sd-2116.dedibox.fr/pydocweb/wiki/Front%20Page/">NumPy documentation wiki</a>, which pulls docstrings out of <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/">NumPy</a> source code and creates patches when users make edits. Cool!</li>
	<li>And <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/04/us/politics/04margins_graphic.html">this just rocks</a> (particularly if you're a wish-I-had-some-talent viz geek). <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/1093745">This rocks too</a> (and not only if you're a Python fan).</li>
</ul>
Now, back to editing an introductory chapter on databases...
