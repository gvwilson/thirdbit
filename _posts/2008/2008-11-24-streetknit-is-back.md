After a bit of hiatus caused by getting married (to me) and moving house (with me—and yes, we're still married), Sadie is <a href="http://www.streetknit.ca/?p=68">warming up StreetKnit for another season</a>. You knit, they give it to the homeless to help them get through the winter, and the world is a slightly better place as a result.  If you'd like to help, see <a href="http://www.streetknit.ca">streetknit.ca</a>.
