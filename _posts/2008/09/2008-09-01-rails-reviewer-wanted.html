For the past few days, <a href="http://bwinton.latte.ca/">Blake Winton</a> has been reviewing every single commit made by a team of students who building a medium-sized <a href="http://www.djangoproject.org">Django</a> application. We'd really like to find someone (not necessarily in the Toronto area, but that would make it easier for me to buy her/him lunch) who'd be willing to do the same for a <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">RubyOnRails</a> project that Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~reid">Karen Reid</a> is running. As well as generally making the world a better place, it would also be a great way to meet (and recruit) some of our most talented students.  If you're interested, please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@cs.toronto.edu">drop me a line</a>.

Meanwhile, we're teaching our daughter a new verse to an old song:

<em>The zombies on the bus go, "Brains... brains... brains..."</em>

Parenthood turns out to be fun in all sorts of unanticipated ways :-)
