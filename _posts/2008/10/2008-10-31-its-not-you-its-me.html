After a lot of thought, I have regretfully decided to resign as a contributing editor with <a href="http://www.ddj.com"><em>Doctor Dobb's Journal</em></a>. The magazine is still great reading, and Jon Erickson and his crew have been a rare pleasure to work with, but I simply don't have the time to keep up any longer. It's been a lot of fun --- I'll miss it.
