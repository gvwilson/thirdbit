Via David Crow (who has <a href="http://www.startupnorth.ca/2008/11/25/velocity-project-exhibition/">comments on it as well</a>), an article by Joey deVilla on the <a href="http://www.globalnerdy.com/2008/11/25/velocity-project-exhibition/">Fall 2008 VeloCity Project Exhibition</a> at the University of Waterloo. VeloCity is a dorm reserved for would-be entrepreneurs, complete with  a boardroom, a mobile device lab, high-bandwidth wifi, large flatscreens, etc. The exhibition was a tradeshow-style show and tell of the students' ideas, some of which were as good as the best things we've seen at DemoCamp.  As Joey says, why wasn't something like this around when I was in university?  (And why isn't there anything like this in Toronto?)
