...but too much has piled up for me to do more than post a few randoms:
<ul>

Florian Shkurti has a few things to say about <a href="http://florianshkurti.wordpress.com/2008/11/09/college-puzzle-challenge-2008/">how to do well</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/">Jamis Buck</a> has some interesting thoughts on <a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2008/11/9/legos-play-doh-and-programming">LEGO, Play-Doh, and programming</a>.</li>
	<li>The new president of the Maldives wants to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/nov/10/maldives-climate-change">buy a new homeland</a> for his people in case global warming drowns the one they have.  'nuff said.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.onspec.ca/home.html"><em>On Spec</em></a> magazine will be publishing my short story <em>Still</em> in an upcoming issue.  Yay!</li>
</ul>
