I posted a note about <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/1602.html">Wordle</a> back in June, and keep coming across interesting ways to use it.  The most recent is <a href="http://mndoci.com/blog/2008/11/08/of-word-clouds-and-speaker-bios/">this "abstract"</a> from Amazon's Deepak Singh:<img src="{{site.github.url}}/files/2008/11/wordle.png" alt="Wordle Abstract" />
Anybody doing this for code yet?
