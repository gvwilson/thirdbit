Our apologies to all readers of the streetknit.ca blog who are now getting third-bit.com items: our hosting service, site5.com, has messed up its configuration files, and has so far been unable to un-mess them.  (Yesterday, for example, they were redirecting people to a Lithuanian culture site.)  We hope they'll fix things soon.
