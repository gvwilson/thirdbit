I've been thinking a lot over the last couple of years about what an entry-level requirements and/or modeling tool would look like---something that undergrad students would find so useful in courses that they'd actually want to use it (instead of just going through the motions to get a grade).  Over at InfoQ, there's a good summary of some interesting discussion about <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/06/agile-traceability-matrix">traceability in agile projects</a> that I think is relevant.
