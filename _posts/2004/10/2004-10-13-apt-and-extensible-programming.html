Over in the java.net community forums, Bruce Chapman suggests that we <a href="http://forums.java.net/jive/thread.jspa?messageID=1402&tstart=0#1402">deprecate javac</a> in the next major Java release.  Yup, that's right: no more javac.  Instead, he suggests that we all start using <code>apt</code>, which allows developers to run their own code inside the compiler.  As he says, "Do you want a compiler error when you implement an interface and the javadocs say that implementations must have a public default constructor, and yours doesn't?  Well <code>apt</code> [can] do that..."

It's a pretty cool idea.  It's also a perfect example of the kind of extensible tools that I think are going to dominate programming in the years to come.  If I'd read it a week earlier, I would have mentioned it in my <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/~gvwilson/xmlprog.html">extensible programming</a> article, which has just gone off to <a href="http://www.acmqueue.org/">ACM Queue</a>.  Maybe I can throw it in as a late footnote...
