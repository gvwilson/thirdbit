<p>
The biggest problem with classpaths is that there is no standard way of defining them.  Classpaths can be set through environment variables (which have an OS-specific syntax), command-line arguments to the VM, system properties (which can be set through the command-line or a properties file), and even by arbitrary code running within a JVM.
</p>

<p>
For instance, Eclipse keeps track of classpaths for individual projects through the <code>.classpath</code> XML file in the project's root directory.
</p>

<p>
Ant, on the other hand, builds its classpath from many places.  It looks through environment variables (<code>CLASSPATH</code> and <code>ANT_OPTS</code>, in particular), the system properties, and the build script that's currently loaded.  On top of that, Ant uses at least two distinct classloaders, which maintain their own individual classpaths: one for loading Ant, the tasks, and their dependencies, and one for for actually executing the tasks.
</p>

<p>
When you put Eclipse and Ant together, the potential for distaster increases exponentially.
</p>

<p>
About four-hundred revisions back in time (revision 94, to be exact), I changed the build file around to unify the data model of Hippo with the UI layer, which used to be contained within separate Eclipse projects.  Like all servlet-based web applications, the UI layer stored its class files in <code><em>$WEBAPP_ROOT</em>/WEB-INF/classes</code>.  The test case classes were stored in <code>build/test</code>.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, Eclipse's <code>.classpath</code> file was still set to compile all classes directly into the <code>build</code> directory.
</p>

<p>
This isn't a problem if you use Eclipse's build system exclusively to build and run your code.  It's also not a problem if you use Ant to exclusively build and run your code.
</p>

<p>However, if Ant and Eclipse's classpath configurations are not in sync (which has been the case from revision 94 up to just a few days ago) and you use Ant to build and Eclipse to run, you will get many <code>ClassNotFoundException</code>s.</p>

<p>
Why did that happen?  Eclipse was set to compile classes into the <code>build</code> directory.  Therefore, it added the <code>build</code> directory to its default runtime classpath.
</p>

<p>
When you use Ant to build the project, Ant stores the compiled class files in two places.  The test classes are saved in <code>build/test</code> while everything else is put into <code><em>$WEBAPP_ROOT</em>/WEB-INF/classes</code>.
</p>

<p>
Now when you go to run the tests in Eclipse, Eclipse looks for them in <code>build</code>, but they're really stored in <code>build/test</code> and <code><em>$WEBAPP_ROOT</em>/WEB-INF/classes</code>.
</p>

<p>
So what's the solution?  Configure Ant so that its build process is in sync with Eclipse.  Right now, this is being done redundantly and manually, but I'm sure with a little extra effort, Ant can be taught to read Eclipse's <code>.classpath</code> configuration automatically.
