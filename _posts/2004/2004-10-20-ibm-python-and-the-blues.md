<p>I gave a talk about Python at IBM's Toronto lab yesterday.  It seemed to go pretty well---Paul Buck, who'd invited me out there, said that his group in IBM sees LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and Perl/Python/PHP) as being as big a threat to Java as .NET, so they want to learn more about all of 'em.</p>

<p>That's the good news.  The bad news was the makeup of the audience: roughly 40 people attended, all of them male (except for admin who'd handled the arrangements).  I can't imagine giving a talk to that many doctors or lawyers and finding myself in front of a single-gender audience. *sigh*</p>
