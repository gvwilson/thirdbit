<p>Bruce Schneier is probably the industry's best-known expert on computer security.  Judging from his books and web articles, he's also a tremendously sensible person.  <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2004/12/safe_personal_c.html">This article</a> is an updated description of what (little) you can do to make yourself more secure online.  Highly recommended.</p>
