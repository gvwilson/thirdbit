<p>Michelle Levesque recently <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/heliumblog/archives/000044.html">posted</a> about her discovery that scripting the existing partial implementation of <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/helium">Helium</a> would help her develop the rest of it.  Scriptability is actually one of the system's must-have features: instructors <em>must</em> be able to create accounts and projects by the dozens, to assign people to groups by processing <em>ad hoc</em> flat files, and so on.</p>

<p>So what are our options?</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Web services</em>: have scripts in Perl, Python, and whatever talk to the web interface we're building for <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/helium">Helium</a> anyway.</li>
<li>A <em>library of bindings</em> to whatever scripting language(s) we choose to support (probably managed using <a href="http://www.swig.org">SWIG</a>).</li>
<li>Use of a <em>Java-friendly scripting language</em> that can talk to <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/helium">Helium</a>'s model directly.</li>
</ol>

<p>The third option appeals to me most, as it seems like the least work.  Several scripting languages, like <a href="http://www.jython.org">Jython</a> (the Java implementation of <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>) and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">Rhino</a> (Mozilla's pure-Java implementation of JavaScript) can manipulate Java classes directly. It <em>sounds</em> like a good fit, but I've never used either in anger.  I'd enjoy hearing from anyone who has...</p>
