Links that accumulated while I was on the road:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.artcompsci.org/kali/development.html"><em>The Art of Computational Science</em></a>: lengthy (several hundred pages) PDF book on numerical simulation in astrophysics with examples in Ruby.  This would be a great counterpoint to <a href="http://swc.scipy.org">Software Carpentry</a> if it was (re-)written in Python... ;-)</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/nwp/external/fcm/">Flexible Configuration Management</a> system: built by the British Met Office, it combines Subversion, Trac, and a custom extract-and-build tool to give scientists and environment for managing complex climate modeling codes. It'd put most commercial shops to shame...</li>
	<li><a href="http://lostgarden.com/2007/07/chemistry-of-game-design.html">The Chemistry of Game Design</a>: I'm not convinced that user interfaces (particularly games) can ever move past "alchemy" to "chemistry", but Danc makes a good case.</li>
	<li>An <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/07/bio_mapping_pro.html">emotional map of San Francisco</a>: this is just plain cool --- and a little spooky.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.6thsenseanalytics.com/">6th Sense Analytics</a>: gathers data about what developers are actually doing.  In any other context, it would be called a surveillance system --- there's no way I could get ethics board approval to do this to my students, so why is it legal for companies to do it to their employees?</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.artima.com/forums/flat.jsp?forum=276&thread=210719">Improvements to JUnit</a>. Yes, that means even more features...</li>
	<li>A Google Tech Talk on <a href="http://kylecordes.com/2007/07/12/youtube-scalability/">YouTube's scalability issues</a>.  We should be teaching this stuff...</li>
	<li>Yet more talk about <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/07/uc_berkeley_rev.html">universities abandoning desktop office suites and moving to their web-based cousins</a> --- this time, it's UC Berkeley.  Good links to evaluations...</li>
	<li>Google releases <a href="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2007/07/google-singleton-detector-released.html">a singleton detector</a>.  Why?  Because singletons make code harder to test.</li>
	<li>Jon Udell interviews Henryk Nielsen on the <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2007/07/25/henrik-frystyk-nielsen-on-the-restful-architecture-of-microsoft-robotics-studio/">RESTful architecture of Microsoft's Robotics Studio</a>.</li>
	<li>XKCD is <a href="http://xkcd.com/294/">frighteningly prescient</a> once again.</li>
</ul>
