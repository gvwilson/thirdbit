I have just posted a [30-minute video of my talk "Software Engineering's Greatest Hits"][video].
In brief:
software engineering researchers have learned a lot over the last 50 years,
but most working programmers don't even know that knowledge exists.
I think the way to close that knowledge gap is to teach a bit of data science to undergraduate computer scientists
so that they'll understand what claims are actually being made,
and _then_ tell them what we currently think we know.
To make this work,
I think we have to teach data science using software engineering data and examples—there are
lots of good generic data science courses out there,
but most people learn best and fastest when the examples are directly relevant to their own domain.
A course like this would fit into the curriculum and be culturally defensible ("Look, math!")
and I think it would also be very popular with students ("Look, data science!").
And if I've learned anything in the last 20 years,
it's that simply presenting the results bounces off:
if it was going to work, it would have by now.
I hope you'll enjoy the talk - comments and feedback are very welcome.
