In the second half of last year (and doesn't it feel so good to call 2020 "last year"?)
a group of us created and translated some concept maps for various topics in data science.
What we have is [online][concept-maps] under a Creative Commons license;
we hope you find them useful.

*If you'd like to contribute, there are instructions on the site.
And if you'd like to make contributing much easier,
please take a look at [this issue](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio/issues/1208) for <http://diagrams.net>:
maintaining translations would be a lot easier if we could store alternate sets of text in drawings...*
