I have just posted a [40-minute video of my talk "What Everyone In Tech Should Know About Teaching and Learning"][video].
It's a quick tour of the most popular material from *[Teaching Tech Together][t3]*,
which in turn is based on training I originally developed at [the Carpentries][carpentries]
and for [RStudio's instructor training and certification program][rstudio-instructors].
The [slides are available][slides] under a Creative Commons license,
and I'm always happy to deliver it as a lunch-and-learn.
I hope you find it useful—feedback is always welcome.
