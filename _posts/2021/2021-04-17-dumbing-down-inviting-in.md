Most of the early feedback on *Building Tech Together* has been positive,
but one person has said that I'm over-simplifying some things and dumbing down others.
I'm not sure what the difference is,
but my answer is that Newtonian physics isn't a dumbed down version of quantum mechanics or general relativity:
it's a simpler model that is easier for newcomers to start with
while being perfectly good for solving a wide range of problems.
It's [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) instead of [Python](http://python.org/) or [Java](https://java.com/),
and I'm past feeling that anyone should apologize
for giving people a ramp they can walk up instead of a cliff to climb.

I also try to respect the fact that
the people I'm writing for don't have time to read the primary literature and weigh its nuances,
and that expecting them to reveals a lot of privilege.
Academia cares less about being right than about not being wrong,
so papers are littered with defensive get-outs like "perhaps", "might indicate", and "however".
In contrast,
every teacher has to teach tomorrow (or this afternoon, or in an hour)
which means they have to decide *now* whether to do X or not.
As one said to me years ago,
if a student is right 90% of the time that's an A+;
if a teacher can do just as well in the time they actually have,
they should be just as proud.
