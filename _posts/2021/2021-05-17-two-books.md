      Hi - I'm Greg Wilson, and this short talk describes two new open access
      resources you might want to use in undergraduate software engineering
      classes.

      The first, called <em><a href="{{'/sdxjs/' | relative_url}}">Software
      Design by Example Using JavaScript</a></em>, teaches software design by
      showing students how to build simple versions of twenty widely-used
      software development tools. The second, called <em><a
      href="https://buildtogether.tech/">Building Software Together</a></em>, is
      a guide to workng in a small team for a single term. Both books are freely
      available under a Creative Commons license.

      Here's how it all started. Back in the early 2000s I taught a course on
      software architecture three times at the University of Toronto and then
      told the department they should cancel it. The problem was a lack of
      material: between them, the eight books I had on my shelf with "software
      architecture" in the title spent a total of less than 30 pages describing
      actual systems. They explained how to gather architectural requirements,
      how to maintain them, and how to communicate them, but didn't show readers
      what real systems looked like.

      In frustration, I mailed 200 programmers and asked them to write a chapter
      each describing the most beautiful piece of software they'd ever seen. We
      wound up with 34 contribution, which were published as a book called
      <em>Beautiful Code</em>. It won a Jolt Award and raised quite a bit of
      money for charity, but it wasn't useful as a textbook: the pieces of
      software contributors described ranged in size from a few lines of code to
      multi-million line systems, and required far more background knowledge
      than undergrads were likely to have.

      Our second attempt was a pair of books
      called <em><a href="http://aosabook.org/">The Architecture of Open Source
      Applications</a></em>. The entries were much more uniform in level, but
      the contributors used such a wide range of languages that once again most
      students would have struggled to follow along. On the upside, all of the
      content was (and is) open access.

      The irony is, I learned most of what I know about software design from a
      series of books that avoided all of these problems. The trilogy that Brian
      Kernighan and colleagues wrote in the early 1980s didn't just teach people
      C and Unix: they taught my generation how to think about programming by
      showing us how to build the tools we used to program.

      Which brings us to <em><a href="https://stjs.tech/">Software Tools in
      JavaScript</a></em>. Its aim is to teach software design by walking
      readers through the construction of simple versions of tools they actually
      use. The book uses JavaScript rather than Java, Python, or something more
      modern because JavaScript is the one unavoidable language - and these
      days, it's actually not bad.

      The material covers twenty tools, ranging from a very (very) simple
      version control system to a browser layout engine, an interactive
      debugger, and a style checker.

      Each entry is short enough to cover in one or two lectures. Together, they
      introduce some common design patterns, show students how to test complex
      systems by mocking or stubbing components, and introduce them to tools
      they should probably be using anyway.

      There are lots of starting points for homework exercises, mostly of the
      form "add this feature to tool X" or "build a very simple version of tool
      Y from scratch". If your students do the latter, we'd be very happy to
      include their work - with full attribution - in Volume 2. And if you think
      of a tool that we haven't covered but should, like a fuzz tester or
      accessibility auditor, please dive in.

      Meanwhile, whenever I run into one of my former project students, they
      tell me that the most useful thing I taught them wasn't about code: it was
      about how to work in a team. I think this is more important with each
      passing year: we used to say, "Move fast and break things," and while I
      don't know if we did the former, it's pretty clear at this point that
      we've done a lot of breaking.

      The second book, <em><a href="https://buildtogether.tech/">Building
      Software Together</a></em>, is what a small team of undergrads needs to
      know to get through their first semester-long project. It talks about
      version control and continuous integration, but it's mostly about the
      human side of software engineering.  How do you run a meeting? How do you
      review someone else's code? How to handle deadlines when you're juggling
      assignments in several different courses whose lecturers don't seem to
      talk to each other?

      I'm still dissatisfied with some parts of this book. In particular, I
      don't think the chapters on security and inclusivity are going to persuade
      someone who doesn't already care about these things that they should. I've
      taught ethics to engineers, and I think that in a lot of cases, they tune
      out while we're talking, tell us what they think we expect to hear, and
      carry on as before. If you or your students can think of better approaches
      for these important topics, please let me know - I'm happy to rewrite.
