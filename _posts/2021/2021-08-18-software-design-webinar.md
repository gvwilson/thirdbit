I'm repeating my webinar on [Software Design for Data Scientists][sd4ds] on Sept 1:
tickets are available through Eventbrite
(at two prices depending on your circumstances),
attendees will get a £100 e-book voucher from the good folks at CRC Press,
and all proceeds will go to [Books for Africa][b4a].
I hope to see you there.
