<p>Cameron Neylon recently posted an article titled "<a href="http://cameronneylon.net/blog/github-for-science-shouldn%E2%80%99t-we-perhaps-build-tcpip-first/">Github for science? Shouldn't we perhaps build TCP/IP first?</a>" His argument is that the web's a good way to move text around, because it was built by programmers, and programmers work with text. It's not (yet) well suited to moving <em>science</em> around, because we don't (yet) have something as granular and portable as text for scientific ideas. Yes, any particular piece of research can be represented as text, but so can any image, or any audio stream, or anything else–it's the structure that adds meaning, and we haven't (yet) agreed on structures. Circling back to today's first post, part of what we're trying to do is give scientists the background to understand and take part in conversations like these...</p>
