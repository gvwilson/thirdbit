I'm glad you asked:
<ul>
	<li>Today was my last day at <a href="http://www.sidefx.com">Side Effects</a>; thanks to a grant from the <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/2012/01/sloan-foundation-grant-to-software-carpentry-and-mozilla/">Sloan Foundation</a>, I start work on <a href="http://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> again on Monday.</li>
	<li>I'm running <a href="http://p2pu.org/en/groups/how-to-teach-webcraft-and-programming-to-free-range-students/">an open course on how to teach programming to free-range learners</a> over at P2PU, which also starts on Monday.</li>
	<li>Volume 2 of <a href="http://aosabook.org"><em>The Architecture of Open Source Applications</em></a> is coming along nicely&mdash;<a href="http://www.amyrbrown.ca/">Amy Brown</a> is doing her usual great job of organizing, editing, and managing reviews, and we hope to have it on the shelves (and the web, and your tablet) in April.</li>
	<li>Ellen Hsiang and I collected some great feedback on <a href="http://sensibleadventures.com/and-then/"><em>And Then...</em></a> just before Christmas, and we're going to try to find time to make some revisions in the next couple of months. I haven't written any fiction since last February, but Sadie has threatened to get me a desk in a shared workspace two mornings a week as a birthday present to shame me into putting my head down and actually <em>finishing</em> one of the novels I've got on the go.</li>
</ul>
It's going to be a busy few months...
