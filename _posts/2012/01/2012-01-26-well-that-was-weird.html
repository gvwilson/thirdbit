It's amazing what you can learn when you don't have cable TV:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://peaceful.com/">peaceful.com</a> says "coming soon".</li>
	<li><a href="http://joyful.com/">joyful.com</a> is a one-man software shop. At least he's Irish.</li>
	<li><a href="http://disappointed.com/">disappointed.com</a> tells you to get over it.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.angry.com/">angry.com</a> and <a href="http://sad.com/">sad.com</a> are both for sale.</li>
	<li><a href="http://happy.com">happy.com</a> redirects to Walgreen's pharmacy.</li>
</ul>
