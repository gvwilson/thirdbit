I don't know if I'll make it to <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/">PyCon 2013</a> or not (lots of other traveling for <a href="http://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> == too much time away from family already), but here are some talks that would draw me in:
<ol>
	<li><strong><em>What I Would Take Out of Python</em></strong>. It's grown a lot over the years; given what we have now, what would you take out, and why?</li>
	<li><strong><em>How the Hell Did That Happen?</em> </strong>How did Rails capture so many hearts and minds when Ruby was a relatively unknown language whose user base in North America and Europe was only a few percent of Python's?</li>
	<li><strong><em>Eloquent Python</em></strong>. An exploration of teachable uses of design patterns in the Python standard library.</li>
	<li><strong><em>Ten Things We Know About Python Programs and Programmers</em></strong>. What do we actually know about execution profiles, common bugs, user demographics, etc.</li>
	<li><strong><em>Error Handling in Python</em></strong>. What are some patterns for recovering from errors in Python (as opposed to just logging them)?</li>
</ol>
