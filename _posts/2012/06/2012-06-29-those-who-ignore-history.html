<strong>1997</strong>

<p>P: Hi, I'm a programmer.  I'm starting an online retail company. What do you two do?</p>

<p>G: Hi, I'm a graphic designer. I know how to select and arrange text and images in ways that are appealing, informative, and usable.</p>

<p>M: And I'm in marketing. I know how to identify people's needs and craft messages that will appeal to them.</p>

<p>P: Huh. Those both seem much simpler to me than programming. I don't think I need to hire you.</p>

<strong>2003</strong>

<p>G&amp;M: So, how did your startup do?</p>

<p>P: It tanked. People kept saying the site was ugly and confusing. I guess I should have hired you back in '97 after all.</p>

<strong>2012</strong>

<p>P: Hi, I'm a programmer. I'm starting an online education company. What do you do?</p>

<p>T: Hi, I'm a teacher. I know how to select and arrange learning materials in ways that are appealing, informative, and effective.</p>

<p>P: Huh. That seems simpler to me than programming...</p>
