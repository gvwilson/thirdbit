Marcus Lau and Maxwell Elendt, two high school students whose science project I was mentoring, picked up a silver medal at the Toronto Science Fair on the weekend. The project was titled "Headshots: Detecting Concussions with Accelerometers"; in it, they hooked an off-the-shelf accelerometer up to a hockey helmet, put it on a mannequin's head, and had people of various ages and sizes whack it with a hockey stick and/or their fist in order to see what kinds of impacts they could produce. It was a lot of fun, and I think they learned a lot about how to work with real-world data. Congratulations on the prize&mdash;it's well deserved.
