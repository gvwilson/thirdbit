<p>
  I am pleased to announce that my YA novelette <cite>Still</cite>
  is
  <a href="www.lulu.com/shop/greg-wilson/still/paperback/product-21193614.html">now available in paperback at Lulu.com</a>
  and
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F1E4Y0W">as a Kindle e-book on Amazon.com</a>.
  The story is an extended version of one that ran in
  the <a href="http://www.onspec.ca/node/143">Summer 2010 edition of <cite>OnSpec</cite> magazine</a>;
  it deals with some difficult themes,
  but it's the piece of writing I'm proudest of,
  and I hope you enjoy it.
