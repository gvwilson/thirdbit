<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Over the last 15 years, Software Carpentry has evolved from a week-long training course at the US national laboratories into a worldwide volunteer effort to raise standards in scientific computing. This talk explains what we have learned along the way the challenges we now face, and our plans for the future. </p>
