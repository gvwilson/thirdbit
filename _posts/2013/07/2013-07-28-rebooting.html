<p>After repeated hackage (and half-hearted tech support from Dreamhost, which seems to have lost all interest in its customers), I've rebooted this blog using Jekyll and a custom theme instead of WordPress.  I'll be migrating to a new host soon as well; I apologize for any disruption in your feeds.</p>
