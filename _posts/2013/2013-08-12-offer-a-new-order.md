<blockquote>
Every movement that seeks to change society faces two great tasks.  The first is to discredit the old order.  The second is to offer a new one.  Without the assurance of a new order, the debate becomes a choice between order and chaos, and order wins.

– William Saletan, in the <em>New York Times Book Review</em>, Sept 26, 2004
