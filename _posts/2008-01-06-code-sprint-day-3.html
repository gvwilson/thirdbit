Florian and Adam opened the place up; Jeff and I were here 10 minutes later; Tony, Luke, and Yi Qing arrived in time for coffee, and DC and his hangover made it eight.  Paul joined us for lunch (pizza... mm...); tests were written, bugs were found, tickets were updated, all in a slightly subdued atmosphere.  It's been a long three days, but very worthwhile: I'm very (very) pleased with how much everyone has accomplished, and very grateful for all the hard work.  Stay tuned for announcements about new releases...
