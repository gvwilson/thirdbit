      (including fees).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Plans for instructor training
      (which also explains why we're delaying the start of the next online course by a month).
    </p>
  </li>

      and the tool we have started building to support that.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Plans for mentorship and assessment,

  We'll talk about all of this at
  the Dec 4 lab meeting

  Hope to see you there…
