Starting in September 2007, the <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a> will replace its current three-course sequence in software engineering with two new courses.  The first, CSC301, will be suitable for students in all streams; the second will primarily target Software Engineering specialists, though we expect a significant number of students from other specializations (particularly those intending to do <a href="http://www.peyonline.com/">PEY</a> internships) will take it as well.  I've included outlines for the courses below, and I'd be grateful for feedback.

<strong><em>CSC301: Introduction to Software Engineering</em></strong>

An introduction to agile development methods appropriate for medium-sized teams and rapidly-moving projects.  Basic software development infrastructure; requirements elicitation and tracking; estimation and prioritization; teamwork skills; basic UML; design patterns and refactoring; security, ethics, and professional responsibility.

<em>Rationale</em>: CSC301 will introduce students to a complete, coherent set of development practices that are widely used in industry, and also appropriate for graduate-level research.  It will be appropriate for students in specializations other than Software Engineering (such as Information Systems and HCI).

<em>Structure</em>: The course will be built around a term-long project, which will be done in two-week iterations by teams of 3-4 students using agile development methods.  An example of such a project is adding internationalization and accessibility support to <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a>; another is building a simple educational game for the <a href="http://www.laptop.org">OLPC</a>.

<strong><em>CSC302: Engineering Large Software Systems</em></strong>

An introduction to the theory and practice of large-scale software system design, development, and deployment.  Project management; ICONIX and the Rational Unified Process; advanced UML; reverse engineering; requirements inspection; verification and validation; software architecture; performance modeling and analysis.

<em>Rationale</em>: This course will introduce students to the problems encountered in building and maintaining large systems with large, distributed teams.  We hope (but cannot require) that students will take CSC301 and CSC302 in consecutive terms, so that instructors will be able to minimize repetition and maintain momentum.

<em>Structure</em>: The course will be built around a term-long project, which will be done in two iterations by groups of 6-8. Unlike CSC301, this course's project will start from an existing medium-sized application.  In each iteration, teams will go through "inception", "elaboration", "construction", and "transition" phases of the Rational Unified Process (RUP).  As in <a href="http://www.artsandscience.utoronto.ca/ofr/calendar/crs_csc.htm#CSC408H1">CSC408</a>, teams will swap projects midway through the course.
