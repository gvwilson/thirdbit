If you're wondering why electoral reform matters, take a look at the Green Party's proposals, and ponder the fact that despite getting several percent of the popular vote, they have little or no chance of winning any seats (and hence of affecting policy, or growing in size).  I don't agree with lowering the voting age, and I don't think there'd be much of a software industry left if people actually banned unpaid overtime, but other than that, this is the most sensible election platform I've seen in years.  (And for those who still think the Greens are pie-in-the-sky treehuggers, read #9 carefully: no new nuclear or coal power, but only if consumers can reduce consumption by 20%.)

  <li>Cut corporate income taxes by $1 billion over 4 years without affecting tax revenues by shifting taxes from profits to resource use.</li>

  <li>Ban the construction and refurbishment of nuclear reactors and phase out coal-fired power plants by 2009 if consumers can reduce electricity use by 20 per cent through conservation and energy efficiency programs.</li>
  <li>Adopt "California-style" emission standards for new cars, light trucks and SUVs by 2012, provide an additional $2,000 over the federal government's existing sales tax rebate on the purchase of fuel efficient vehicles, and add an additional $2,000 levy on inefficient vehicles.</li>
