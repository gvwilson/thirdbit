As I mentioned a few weeks ago, we're putting together some new software engineering courses at the <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu">University of Toronto</a>.  I'd be very interested in hearing from former 49X students: looking back, what did you learn from doing your project?  What did you find valuable in the course, and what was just plain wrongheaded?

<em>Later: Olivier Yiptong decided to provide feedback in the form of a mindmap---another first for this particular blog ;-)</em>
