This, via several sources: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chronicle-recorder/">chronicle-recorder</a> records writes to memory and registers using <a href="http://valgrind.org/">Valgrind</a>, so that it can later answer questions like, "When was location X executed between times T1 and T2?"  Tools like this (and rewind debuggers, and the stuff Andreas Zeller and others have been working on) promise to deliver a new generation of super-debuggers in the next few years.  Now, would someone please write <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/notontheshelves.html#dtp">the damn book</a>?
