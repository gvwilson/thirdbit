I'm pleased to announce that we're adding one more student to <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/904.html">this summer's team</a>. Tony Balkissoon just finished an engineering degree at U of T; he has been very active on campus in efforts to stop the genocide in Darfur, and is heading to Harvard Law School in September.  Thanks in part to support from <a href="http://deibert.citizenlab.org/">Prof. Ron Deibert</a> of the <a href="http://citizenlab.org/">Citizen Lab</a>, Tony will spend the summer writing student-friendly introductions to legal issues associated with software and the internet, including privacy, property rights, accessibility, and reverse engineering.  I'll blog his work here as it appears; we look forward to your comments on it.
