As mentioned <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/1131.html">earlier</a>, Prof. Randy Pausch of CMU has terminal pancreatic cancer.  He gave his last lecture on Tuesday; video is <a href="http://wms.andrew.cmu.edu/001/pausch.wmv">on the web</a>.
<blockquote>When I die, I shall breathe back the breath that made me live. I shall give back to the world all that I didn't do. All that I might have been and wasn't. All the choices I didn't make. All the things I lost and spent and wasted. I shall give them back to the world. To the lives that haven't been lived yet. That will be my gift back to the world that gave me the life I did live, the life I loved, the breath I breathed.
