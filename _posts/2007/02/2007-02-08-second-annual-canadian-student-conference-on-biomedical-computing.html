<a href="http://www.cutc.ca/2007/">CUTC</a>, <a href="http://www.cusec.net/">CUSEC</a>, and now this --- an <a href="http://www.imaging.robarts.ca/cscbc2007/">undergrad conference on biomedical computing</a>, to be held in mid-March in London, Ontario.  The <a href="http://cscbc2006.cs.queensu.ca/">first one</a>, which ran last year at Queen's, was by all accounts a success; hope to see lots of <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca">U of T</a> students turn out.
