The first link that comes up when you google for "Microsoft Press" takes you to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/books/default.mspx">this page</a>.  Using a stopwatch, see how long it takes you to find the email address you should send review copy requests to.  Then guess how long it will take for your message to be answered.  Oh, wait, that's a trick question: after two months, it still hasn't been.  Then go back and look for <em>any</em> relevant contact information; after a few frustrating minutes, you'll find a 1-800 number for John Wiley & Sons.  Call them.  See if the publicist you're connected to has ever heard of Microsoft Press.  (That's another trick question.)

Now, for bonus points: is there a conspiracy to ignore MS Press books? Based on evidence to date, the only correct answer is, "Yes---and it's being run by Microsoft."

*sigh*
