The announcement is out for Google's <a href="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2007/02/speaking-of-summer.html">Summer of Code 2007</a>.  This is a great opportunity for both students and open source organizations; hope we see lots of applicants from the <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a>.
