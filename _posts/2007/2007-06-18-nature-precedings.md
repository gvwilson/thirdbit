<blockquote>giv[es] researchers a place to post documents such as preprints and presentations in a way that makes them globally visible and citable.  Submissions are filtered by a team of curators to weed out obviously inappropriate material, but there's no peer-review so accepted contributions appear online very quickly -- usually within a couple of hours.</blockquote>
