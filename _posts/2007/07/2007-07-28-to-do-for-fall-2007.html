Must... get... organized:
<ol>
	<li>Spend time with my <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/category/family/">family</a>.</li>
	<li>Create and teach <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/882.html">CSC301</a> --- I know what's going to be in the lectures (more or less), but I still have to decide what the extended exercise will be.</li>
	<li>Get my three graduate students (Samir Abdi, Jeremy Handcock, and Carolyn MacLeod) started on their research.</li>
	<li>Lose the 6 kg. I've put on in the last fourteen months (moved up from #10 at Sadie's "suggestion").</li>
	<li>Get more research funding.</li>
	<li>Put together a full proposal for a professional master's degree in <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu">Computer Science</a> at <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca">U of T</a>.</li>
	<li>Get the new ticketing system integrated into <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a>.</li>
	<li>Help <a href="http://davidcrow.ca/">David Crow</a> with <a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCamp">DemoCamp</a> (and try to run at least one on campus, in the afternoon, so that more <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca">U of T</a> folks can attend).</li>
	<li>Finish the "CS-1 in Python" book I've been working on with <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~campbell">Jennifer</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~pgries">Paul</a>, and Jason.</li>
	<li>Talk someone into putting together a <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/notontheshelves.html#aosa">sequel</a> to <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596510046/"><em>Beautiful Code</em></a>.</li>
	<li>Read at least a few of the items on my <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/wishlist.html">wish list</a>.</li>
</ol>
