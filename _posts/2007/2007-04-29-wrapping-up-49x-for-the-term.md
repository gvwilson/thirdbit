Another term, another great bunch of 49X projects:
<ul>
  <li>David Wright and Richard Zhao made a lot of progress rewriting a brain scan visualizer for the <a href="http://rotman-baycrest.on.ca/">Rotman Research Institute</a>.  The project was co-supervised by Imran Somji, an ex-49er himself.</li>
  <li>Muhammad Ali and Adam Foster built a very nice dashboard display for DrProject.  It hasn't been integrated into the main code yet, but that ought to happen in May.</li>
  <li>Melissa Luu, Lisa Ly, and Apple Viriyakattiyaporn improved the user interface for a family tree visualizer for the <a href="http://www.reed.utoronto.ca/index.html">REED</a>.  Their customers plan to deploy it this summer.</li>
  <li>Rick Valenzano and Debbie Winter explored the relationships between game theory and evolution.</li>
  <li>Lillian Angel, Jane Shen, and Martin Williams made a lot of improvements to the Online Marking Tool; Martin is going to continue working on it full-time this summer.</li>
  <li>David Chen and Winson Chung fixed a lot of bugs in the CPython version of Mark Guzdial's multimedia Python library, while Mikhail Temkine cleaned up some in <a href="http://www.vpython.org">VPython</a>.</li>
  <li>Maria Khomenko and Andrey Petrov implemented new kinds of file locking in <a href="http://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a>.</li>
</ul>
It was a very productive term; my only regret is that I was too busy to get t-shirts printed or arrange the usual end-of-term dinner. Maybe now that marks are in…

Best wishes, and best of luck, to everyone who took part—I look forward to hearing all about your future adventures.
