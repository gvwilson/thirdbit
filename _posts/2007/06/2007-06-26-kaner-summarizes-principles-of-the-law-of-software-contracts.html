Again via <a href="http://www.ninjatactics.com">Adam Goucher</a>, a post by <a href="http://www.satisfice.com/kaner/">Cem Kaner</a> <a href="http://www.satisfice.com/kaner/?p=19">summarizing</a> the American Law Institute's proposed Principles of the Law of Software Contracts.  As Kaner points out, these will have a major impact on the software industry in areas ranging from bug disclosure to reverse engineering.  The ALI report costs $25, and is written in dense legalese, so I look forward to more summaries ;-)
