The regular monthly PyGTA meeting on March 20 will feature an introduction to the One Laptop Per  Child project, and particularly the Python-coded Sugar development  environment.  It'll also have some discussion on news and  events in the Python world, such as the University of Toronto choosing  Python as its first-year teaching language.

The meeting will be in the Linux Caffe at the corner of Grace and Harbord.   People will start gathering around 6:30pm and get started with the more formal  discussions around 7:00pm.  Attendees normally wrap up the formal session  between 8:30 and 9:00 and head out for beer, ice-cream and the like.
