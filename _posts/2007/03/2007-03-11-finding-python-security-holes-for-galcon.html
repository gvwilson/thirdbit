I'm (still) in love with <a href="http://www.imitationpickles.org/galcon/index.html">GalCon</a>, a five-minute real-time strategy game that's surprisingly addictive.  Its author, Phil Hassey, would like to provide a plugin API so that users can write bots (in Python).  He has <a href="http://www.imitationpickles.org/galcon/forum/9/180/">posted</a> a strawman proposal, and would appreciate feedback --- he'd prefer if comments about it were made on the <a href="http://www.pygame.org/news.html">pygame</a> mailing list, because other Python game programmers are interested in the answers too.

And hey --- try the game... ;-)
