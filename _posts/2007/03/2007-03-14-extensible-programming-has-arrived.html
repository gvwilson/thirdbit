I've been saying for a while now that extensible programming systems are the Next Big Thing, but I wasn't expecting them to arrive <em>this</em> quickly.  Check out <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~ade/research/ade-aosd.07.pdf"><em>Expressive Programs Through Presentation Extension</em></a>, by Eisenberg and Kiczales (at UBC).  They use Java plus annotations for storage, rather than XML, which allows them to piggyback on the standard Java/Ant/JUnit/Eclipse toolset.  They even provide (simple) graphical embeddings; the only thing missing from the core I <a href="http://www.acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=247&page=1">asked for in 2004-05</a> is debugger support.  Anyone wanna do a PhD? ;-)
