Dale Dougherty, at O'Reilly, posted a rather pessimistic article titled "<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/03/another_war_wer.html">Us vs. Spam: Another War We're Not Winning</a>".  Scary stats: well over 90% of traffic is junk on some servers.  Charging even $0.0001 per message would make spam uneconomic, but as with signing and other proposals, it seems socially infeasible.
