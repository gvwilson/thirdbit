I'm giving a talk tomorrow at the University of Toronto titled "Gibson's Law and Software Engineering".  <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/lectures/toronto-2007-03.ppt">PowerPoint</a> and <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/lectures/toronto-2007-03.pdf">PDF</a> are both now online, for those of you who can't make it.  (Is this what they call "ego-blogging"? ;-))
