Kwasi Kwakwa is a materials scientist who teaches computer-related subjects in Ghana.  He recently posted <a href="http://ghanageek.wordpress.com/2007/03/25/pictures-from-the-competition/">pictures</a> from a programming contest, the eventual aim of which is to assemble a national team for the International Programming Olympiad.
