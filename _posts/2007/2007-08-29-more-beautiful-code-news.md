A lot happened while I was on holiday:
<ul>
	<li>RegDeveloper in the UK <a href="http://www.regdeveloper.co.uk/2007/08/09/beautiful_code/">liked it</a>.</li>
	<li>Jon Bentley gave a talk about Quicksort at Google (<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1031789501179533828&pr=goog-sl">video online</a>). He refers to <em>BC</em> as "a reasonably cool book", which I think it is a good description.</li>
	<li>We discovered that a PDF of the book is already available (illegally) through file-sharing sites. Stealing money from big rock bands might not bother you; I hope that taking it away from people who are trying to help prisoners of conscience does.</li>
</ul>
