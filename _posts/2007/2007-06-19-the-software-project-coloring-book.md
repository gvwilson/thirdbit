For the past three or four years, I've been looking for something that would tell undergraduate students how to run their first team programming project.  The <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/918.html">books and articles</a> I've found so far didn't satisfy me---the books are very dry and out of date, and Stephanie Ludi's excellent <a href="http://www.csc.calpoly.edu/~sludi/SEmanual/TableOfContents.html"><em>Survival Guide</em></a> is too narrow for my purposes---so I'm thinking about writing one myself (sometime) for <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/882.html">CSC301</a>.  Going through old blog postings, I've assembled a tentative table of contents, but this is definitely a case of "what I have" rather than "what students need". I'd be grateful for the interweb's input on this: what do <em>you</em> think students should be told as they set out to do their first term-long multi-person development project?
