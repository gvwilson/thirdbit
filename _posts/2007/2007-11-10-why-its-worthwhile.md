I was pretty depressed by the lack of CS department demos at DC15, so David Crow's <a href="http://davidcrow.ca/article/1768/democamptoronto16-dec-3-2007">reminder</a> of how strong a community has formed around 'Camp stuff in just two years was timely (and welcome).  No sign of CS demos for DC16, either, but almost 40 people from outside the department have stepped forward with project ideas for my capstone course next term.
