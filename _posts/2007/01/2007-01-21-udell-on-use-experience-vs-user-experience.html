Another great post from Jon Udell, this time calling on developers to <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2007/01/20/first-have-a-great-use-experience-then-have-a-great-user-experience/">worry about use experience before user experience</a>.  Coincidentally, I was trying to explain a couple of days ago to a senior figure in a publishing firm why I hadn't reviewed any of their books recently.  "I find out about new releases via blogs," I said.  "O'Reilly, Addison-Wesley, APress, and others all blog new books by category, so I don't have to wade through spam to find emailed press releases, or remember to go to your site once every couple of months to find out if you've updated it."  The response?  "What's a blog?"
