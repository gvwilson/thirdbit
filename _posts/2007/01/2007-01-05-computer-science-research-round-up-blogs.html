There are lots of tech round-up blogs out there, and some interesting corporate research blogs (Microsoft's and Google's come to mind), but I'm still trying to find a good aggregator for computer science research news.  <a href="http://clevercs.org/">CleverCS</a> was aimed at undergrads, and is now 404'ing; <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/">Lambda the Ultimate</a> is very good, but narrow (programming language design).  Anyone have pointers?
