CS Games are an inter-university competition involving Computer Science,        Computer Engineering and Software Engineering students from across North        America. As <a href="http://www.csgames.org/2007">their site</a> says:
<blockquote>For an entire weekend, you will be challenged both individually        and cooperatively in a medley of interdisciplinary competitions targeted        at students of any undergraduate year, including first years!It's not about your IQ. Nor is it about your hacking talents or how you        own everyone at gaming. It's not about being resourceful in a different        environment or being able to work with gurus from across the continent.  	  It's about ALL of the above, and more importantly, it's about having a  	  great time in a great city!</blockquote>
<a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca">U of T</a> has <a href="http://www.csgames.org/2007/sponsors.php">never sent a team</a> --- I wonder if anyone's going to fix that this year? ;-)
