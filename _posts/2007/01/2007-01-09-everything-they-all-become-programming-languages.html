<a href="http://www.artima.com/forums/flat.jsp?forum=276&thread=191025">AntUnit 1.0</a> has been released; it allows programmers to define test cases inside an <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> build file, and proves that every build system (or anything else with a configuration file) turns into a programming language.
