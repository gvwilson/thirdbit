Interesting <a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/2007/1/1/40/1/">article</a> in <a href="http://www.the-scientist.com"><em>The Scientist</em></a> about the headaches people are having with universities' tech transfer offices.  I sympathize, and add that many incubators (like Toronto's <a href="http://www.marsdd.com/">MaRS</a>) are no better.
