Very interesting thought-in-progress <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2007/01/09/future-tailors/">post</a> from Jon Udell about how distributed/distributable multimedia allows us all to become mentors and apprentices.  I'm already thinking about requiring my CSC49X project students to produce a webcast as part of their deliverables this term, and about recording clips of Eclipse, Wing, and other IDEs in action in the hopes of convincing students to use them instead of Notepad.  What other parts of CS practice could be taught asynchronously ubiquitous, lightweight audio+video?
