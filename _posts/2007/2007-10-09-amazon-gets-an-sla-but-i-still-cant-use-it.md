Amazon's announcement that its <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2007/10/amazon-s3-at-yo.html">S3 service now has a service level agreement (SLA)</a> is getting a <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/10/amazon_s3_gets.html">lot of coverage</a>, but I still can't use it for class projects: Ontario's Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Acts (<a href="http://www.accessandprivacy.gov.on.ca/english/act/index.html">FIPPA</a>) don't allow me to store sensitive information (e.g., students' work) in jurisdictions that permit secret warrants, like those mandated by the USA PATRIOT Act.  It wouldn't even help if Amazon ran a cluster farm in Canada, since the PATRIOT Act applies to subsidiaries of American firms operating in other countries as well. Funny, sort of: an American government shreds the Constitution a little, and my students can't play with enterprise-scale clusters...

<em>Later: see also <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/10/google_ibm_give.html">this discussion</a> of courseware built around such technologies—again, off limits to Ontario schools thanks to the current administration in Washington.</em>
