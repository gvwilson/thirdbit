This was just forwarded by a friend:
<blockquote>The High Performance Computing (HPC) community is initiating a study to develop education and training pathways in order to enable scientists and engineers to advance the pace of discovery by taking advantage of high performance computing (HPC) and grids.

In order to inform our study, we invite you to complete a survey about your experiences.  We would like you to evaluate a list of categories of expertise according to how relevant they are for your work. We also would like to collect additional information about your training experiences.

The survey is very short and should only take a few minutes to complete.

Please go to the following link to complete the survey: <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=_2f7D2YUJfkH9Dua0PP_2f30_2fQ_3d_3d">http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=_2f7D2YUJfkH9Dua0PP_2f30_2fQ_3d_3d</a>.

The survey will be open for input through September 11, 2007.

Your input is very valuable to us and will help us understand your training needs.

Thank you for your participation in this study!

The questions seemed pretty random/subject to broad interpretation, but I filled it in anyway---I'll be interested to see what if anything comes of it.
