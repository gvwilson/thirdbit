Joey DeVilla has a good report on the <a href="http://globalnerdy.com/2007/08/08/notes-from-facebookcamp-part-1/">Facebook Developers' Camp</a> recently held in Toronto; David Crow adds links to <a href="http://www.softwaredeveloper.com/features/develop-facebook-app-072607/">developer</a> <a href="http://services.tucows.com/developers/2007/07/25/getting-started-with-facebook-application-development/">resources</a>. I've started wondering whether next-generation software project portals will "just" be extensions to tools people use anyway; oh, to have more hours in the day...
