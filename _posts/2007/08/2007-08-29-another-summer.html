Tomorrow is our summer students' last day (and two are already gone).  It's been a great few months: everyone was productive, and I think they all had fun, too. The post-mortem is tomorrow, followed by a barbecue (and possibly a few games of Speed Scrabble).

Thanks, everyone --- it's been a pleasure working with you. (And thanks to Pat Smith for the photo...)
