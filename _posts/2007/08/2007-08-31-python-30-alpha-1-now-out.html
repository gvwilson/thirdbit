After last week's sprint at Google, the first alpha of Python 3.0 is <a href="http://python.org/download/releases/3.0/">available</a>.  This is the release that breaks backward compatibility in order to get rid of some warts---not enough and not enough for some people, but it's still a big step forward for the languages.  Kudos to all involved.
