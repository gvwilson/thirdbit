If <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/08/whats-wrong-with-cs-research.html">this post</a> was more nuanced---paid more attention to shades of gray---it would be more truthful and more interesting.  It's still both, though, and occasionally funny as well:
<blockquote><em>This entire problem space comes down to a single error in the metamathematical approach to computing, which is that the 1930s  metamathematicians were fascinated by the fact that they could represent  any data structure as a function. While this is true, to describe it as  perverse is an insult to perverts.</em></blockquote>
