You can register to attend at <a href="http://democamp.eventbrite.com/">http://democamp.eventbrite.com</a> (pay-what-you-can donations accepted), and submit a demo proposal at <a href="http://democamp.wufoo.com/forms/democamptoronto-demo-submission/">http://democamp.wufoo.com/forms/democamptoronto-demo-submission</a>.  I look forward to seeing lots of you there.
