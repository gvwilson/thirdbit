I'm starting to pull together project ideas for my students for next term.  If you have something with some intellectual challenge in it, and want a couple of grad/undergrad students give you 120 hours each next term to make it happen, please <a href="mailto:gvwilson_at_cs.toronto.edu">let me know</a>.  (If you were all in one place, I'd just <a href="http://www.rants.org/2007/11/04/want-to-help-fix-the-roof/">put up a whiteboard</a>, but you're not.)  You'll have to be  willing to put together 4-6 Ignite-style PowerPoint slides (15 seconds per slide on an automatic timer) to pitch it to the class, since I'm going to let students pick their own projects.  You'll also have to be willing to invest a few hours at the start of term to get them up to speed, and 1-2 hours per week after that to play customer.  Commercial projects are welcome, but students <em>must</em> be able to show their code to the general public.
