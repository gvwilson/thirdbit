Kushal Munir has <a href="http://rseworld.blogspot.com/2007/11/eclipse-democamp.html">nice things to say</a> about last Thursday's UTest demo at IBM's <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamp">Eclipse DemoCamp</a>.  There are still <a href="http://democamp.eventbrite.com/">spots open</a> for DemoCamp 16 (Monday Dec 3 at the Board of Trade building in downtown Toronto) --- hope to see you there.
