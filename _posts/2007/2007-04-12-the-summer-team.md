It has been another eventful week---and it's still only Thursday. We're very pleased to announce the lineup for this summer's team:

Thanks to a generous donation from <a href="http://www.nitido.com">Nitido</a>, <strong>Alex Krizhevsky</strong> and <strong>David Wolever</strong> will be working full-time on <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a>.  They will be joined by <strong>Jeff Balogh</strong> (from the <a href="http://www.ucf.edu/">University of Central Florida</a>) and <strong>David Cooper</strong>, both of whom have won <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a> awards. Jeff and David will focus on making the ticketing system expand on demand, while Alex and David will---well, check out the current <a href="https://www.drproject.org/DrProject/query">tickets</a>, and tell us what you'd like to see most.

<strong>Xiaoyang Guan</strong> also picked up an <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">SoC</a>; he'll be extending <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mylar/">Mylar</a>, a plugin for <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a>, so that users can edit wiki pages in the IDE.  This, combined with <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mylar/">Mylar</a>'s existing support for editing and filing tickets, will let <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> users work with <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a> seamlessly.

<strong>Martin Williams</strong> and <strong>Tony Yiu</strong> will be working on <a href="https://www.drproject.org/olm">OLM</a>, an online marking tool that uses AJAX and other nifty technologies to support over-the-web grading of programming assignments. <strong>Florian Shkurti</strong> will work beside on an OLM-compatible plugin for <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a>, so that students can view markers' comments right in the IDE.  Martin and Tony are being supported by the <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a>, the <a href="http://www.jonahgroup.com">Jonah Group</a>, and <a href="http://www.ideeinc.com">Idee</a>; Florian is another <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a> award winner.

<strong>Pardis Beikzadeh</strong>, who is also being supported by the <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca">university</a>, will work on <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~gvwilson#utest">UTest</a>, a reverse test oracle that allows students to run unit tests against instructors' sample solutions to exercises, without actually seeing those solutions.  This project is still in its early stages, but we're pretty excited about the possibilities.

It promises to be quite a summer...
