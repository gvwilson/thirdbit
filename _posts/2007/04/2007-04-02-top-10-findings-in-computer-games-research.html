In between feedings, burpings, and other miscellaneous tasks, I found <a href="http://avantgame.com/GDC2007_mcgonigal_jane_gamestudiesdownload_SHOWME.pdf">this</a>, which summarizes interesting recent findings in computer games research.  See also Jane McGonigal's AAAS presentation, <a href="http://avantgame.com/McGonigal_AAAS_2007_experimental_gameplay.pdf">"Experimental Gameplay: Toward a Massively Popular Scientific Practice"</a>.
