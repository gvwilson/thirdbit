As announced <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/882.html">previously</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu">U of T</a> is bringing in two new software engineering courses starting in 2007-08.  Team projects will play a large part in both, so I'm looking for student-friendly guides to project management.  I know of three books and one online resource that focus specifically on this topic:
<ol>
	<li>Dawson: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Essence-Computing-Projects-Students-Prentice-Hall/dp/013021972X"><em>The Essence of Computing Projects -- A Student's Guide</em></a> (Prentice-Hall, 1999, 013021972X).  Focuses on research projects, rather than development, but does have some material on project planning.</li>
	<li>Fincher, Petre, and Clark (eds): <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Computer-Science-Project-Work-Principles/dp/185233357X"><em>Computer Science Project Work</em></a> (Springer, 2001, 185233357X).  Surveys the types of projects students can do, rather than providing how-to advice.</li>
	<li>Ludi: Student Survival Guide to Managing Group Projects 2.5 (<a href="http://www.csc.calpoly.edu/~sludi/SEmanual/TableOfContents.html">http://www.csc.calpoly.edu/~sludi/SEmanual/TableOfContents.html</a>, viewed April 23, 2007). This one focuses mostly on group dynamics, dealing with couch potatoes, and so on.</li>
	<li>Ricketts: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Managing-Your-Software-Project-Students/dp/3540760466"><em>Managing Your Software Project: A Student's Guide</em></a> (Springer, 1998, 3540760466).  More on development than Dawson, but still very traditional in its outlook (e.g., favors planning over agility); includes some useful discussion of group dynamics.</li>
</ol>
I'm sure there must be more out there, but Google and Amazon aren't turning anything up.  I'd welcome pointers or suggestions --- it's tempting just to crib from "grownup" books, but I know from experience that undergrad projects are different from their industrial counterparts, and I'd like 301 and 302 to run as smoothly as possible the first time out.
