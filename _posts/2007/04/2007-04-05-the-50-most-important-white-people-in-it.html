eWeek has posted a list of the most influential people in IT.  Their top 50 are <a href="http://www.eweek.com/slideshow/0,1206,a=203626,00.asp">here</a> and <a href="http://www.eweek.com/slideshow/0,1206,pg=0&s=25942&a=203749,00.asp">here</a> --- all are white, and all but two are male.  Doesn't look like the industry I see here in Toronto; certainly doesn't look like my classes.
