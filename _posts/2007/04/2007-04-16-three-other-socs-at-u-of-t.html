I <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/904.html">announced</a> a few posts ago that three U of T (and one from Central Florida) had received <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Summer of Code</a> awards to work with us this summer.  Turns out that three other U of T students have won awards as well:
<ul>
	<li>Jin Chen, for <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/mysql/appinfo.html?csaid=CFF8D7E887E8D777">a performance analysis and anomaly detection tool for MySQL</a></li>
	<li>Khaled Mohammed, for a <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/mono/appinfo.html?csaid=4E4B40ECDAC27C63">Mono verifier</a></li>
	<li>Wojciech Gryc, for <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/ooo/appinfo.html?csaid=829DB472394EC004">integrating R into Calc</a></li>
</ul>
Congratulations to them all.
