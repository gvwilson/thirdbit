Google has announced the winners of this year's <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Summer of Code</a> awards.  They're spread across more than a hundred pages on Google's site, so I've coalesced them <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/soc2007.html">here</a>.  My apologies to people whose names my script may have slightly mangled (character encodings once again).  Next time around, it'd be great if Google could list the schools the winners are at; I'd be very curious to see the distribution.
