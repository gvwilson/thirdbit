There's a <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20071126.wsb-citycraft1126/BNStory/specialSmallBusiness">nice piece</a> in Report on Business about the <a href="http://www.cityofcraft.com/">City of Craft</a> event coming up this Saturday, at which <a href="http://www.streetknit.ca">StreetKnit</a> participants will---I kid you not---be knitting a house.  If that doesn't warm your heart on a cold November night, I don't know what will.
