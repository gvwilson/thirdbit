Can't wait for this term to be over...

But on the bright side, we're having a <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a>/<a href="http://www.drproject.org/olm">OLM</a>/<a href="http://www.drproject.org/utest">UTest</a> hack-a-thon on January 4-6. Jeff's coming up from Florida, seven others have confirmed they'll be there for at least part of the time, temporary network connections and door cards are in the works, I've confirmed that my favorite pizza and Lebanese takeout places will be open --- it should be a lot of fun.
