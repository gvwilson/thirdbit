Posted on behalf of Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~stefan/">Stefan Saroiu</a>:

I would like to announce a brief session of presentations and demos for the Online Social Networking, a graduate course in Computer Science at the University of Toronto.

The goal of the course was to familiarize the students with recent research in building large-scale systems that enable mass communication in a social networking manner. This is a systems and networking course on research topics related to Web 2.0.

An important component of this course was building and evaluating a system or an application centered around online social networks. The final presentations and demos will be held on Friday December 14th at 1pm in Bahen 5256.

Each presentation will last 15 minutes followed by a 5 minute demo and a 10 minute Q&A session. The presentations are open to the public.

For a listing of the talks and demos, please see <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/syslab/courses/csc2231/07au/projects/">http://www.cs.toronto.edu/syslab/courses/csc2231/07au/projects/</a>.
