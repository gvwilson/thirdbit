<a href="http://www.joltawards.com/finalists.html">Finalists for the 2008 Jolt Awards</a> have been announced, and I'm pleased to say that <a href="http://beautifulcode.oreillynet.com/"><em>Beautiful Code</em></a> is on the list. Thanks again to all the contributors for being so generous with their time; we'll know in a month whether we're going to share a "programmer's Oscar".
