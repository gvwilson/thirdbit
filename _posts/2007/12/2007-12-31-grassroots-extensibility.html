Back when I had time to think about <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/category/extensible-programming/">extensible programming</a>, I predicted that the most likely route to its realization was some vendor creating a new version of a wholly-owned toolchain.  After all, if Microsoft had decided that VB.NET source code would be stored as XML, in a format that allowed for arbitrary extension points, everyone else would be saying, "Gosh, that's cool," and racing to catch up.  But tools like <a href="http://jester.sourceforge.net/">Jester</a> (a mutation tester for Java) are forcing me to re-think: while a uniform representation of source code would make what they do easier, it's clearly not essential.

Now, would someone <em>please</em> create an extensible debugger for me? Please?
