As I <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/1172.html">mentioned</a> a couple of months ago, my next children's book, <em>A Bottle of Light</em>, will be published in the spring.  It won't be available through bookstores (it's coming out as part of a new program for reluctant readers from Scholastic, and will be marketed directly to school boards), but as a consolation prize for a cold, dark morning, here's the cover art:
