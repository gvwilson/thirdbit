Ex-49er Ben Vinegar's panel proposal for "Web Service APIs Your Mom Will Love" was one of the first 30 accepted for <a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/blogs/ia.php/2007/10/19/p317#more317">SXSW Interactive 2008</a>.  I won't be able to attend (yet another mid-March'08 event), but I look forward to hearing from those of you who do.
