Could a development portal like <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>, <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org">Trac</a>, or <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a> be built as a <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> application?  OK, that's poorly-phrased: clearly, one <em>could</em> be.  Would it make sense to do so?  Privacy would be one big concern (esp. for non-open source projects), and I'd worry about it disappearing without warning due to a court order or an acquisition (but that's a concern for SourceForge, Google Code, and every other hosted service too). On the other hand, a <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com">Remember The Milk</a>-style shared to-do list would be straightforward... And a bunch of stuff like account provisioning would be taken care of for you...  Hm...
