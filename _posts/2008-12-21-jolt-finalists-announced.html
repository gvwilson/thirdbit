The <a href="http://www.joltawards.com/finalists.html">finalists for this year's Jolt Awards</a> have been announced.  Very pleased to see Andy Hunt's <em>Pragmatic Thinking and Learning</em> on the list, along with Blueprint Requirements Center from Toronto-based Blueprint Software Systems, Komodo (from Vancouver's ActiveState), and Rally Enterprise (in two categories).  The only disappointment is how few of the other entries I even recognize---my skills really are rusting away :-(
