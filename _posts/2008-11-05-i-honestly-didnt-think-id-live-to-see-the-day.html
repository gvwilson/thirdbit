When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.  This note was a promise that all men would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness... I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed---"We hold these these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal."... I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a  nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character...
