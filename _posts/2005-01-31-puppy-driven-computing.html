From Todd Veldhuizen:
<blockquote>Babbage never succeeded in having his analytical engine finished. However, a father-and-son pair of Swedes, Georg and Edvard Scheutz, succeeded in building a working difference engine in 1843. It was clear that the drive toward computer miniaturization had already begun: Babbage's design was intended to be driven by a steam engine, but the Scheutzes' "...does not require great power, and the machine could be kept in motion by a little dog, of the kind that is used in England as motive power for roasting-spits."</blockquote>
The mind, it boggles...
