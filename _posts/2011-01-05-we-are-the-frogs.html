We all know it's not true, but it's still a useful story: if you put a frog in hot water, it will jump out, but if you put it in cool water and slowly boil it, it'll just sit there, because there's never a moment when it says, "Wow, this is hot!"

As with frogs, so with computing education. This post on "<a href="http://blog.sciencecampaign.org.uk/?p=2616">The Collapse of Computing Education in English Schools</a>" could just as well have been written about Canada, the US, or almost anywhere else. It's been a crisis now for so long that many of us have stopped really noticing how much trouble we're in---certainly, I see no sign that the people with the power to change things have this on their "must fix" list.

Which makes <a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2011/01/05/oversold-and-underused-the-ipad-edition/">this post</a> by Mark Guzdial all the more poignant. iPads in the classroom? It's the kind of thing that gets someone headlines, but if teaching methods don't change---radically---it will have just as much (i.e., just as little) impact as all the other tech-in-the-classroom wizardry that has failed us over the past century.

We're about to start another online run of the <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a> course with almost 100 participants from half a dozen countries. A lot of things <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/2010/12/fall-2010-what-went-right-what-went-wrong/">didn't</a> <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/2010/12/peer-to-peer/">work</a> in last fall's run; we're hoping to fix some of those this time around, or at least make <em>different</em> mistakes, so that we can learn a little more about how teaching and the web can be adapted to one another. It may not give school trustees a pile of boxes to stand beside at a photo op, but changing practices is a lot more important than any number of shiny new toys---and a lot harder.
