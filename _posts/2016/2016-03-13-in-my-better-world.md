  In my better world,
  programming language designers have been
  <a href="http://neverworkintheory.org/2014/01/29/stefik-siebert-syntax.html">studying usability</a>
  since the 1960s,
  and every new language worries as much about usability as it does about memory management or concurrency.
</p>
<p>
  In my better world,
  language designers worry about package management as much as they do about type systems.
  Or maybe more–no, definitely more.
</p>
<p>
  In my better world,
  scientists don't create new file formats every time they sneeze.
</p>
<p>
  In my better world,
  people have implemented <a href="https://gitlab.com/mailman/mailman/issues/119">mailing list throttling</a>
  to limit the number of messages one person can send per day
  so that quieter and more thoughtful people have a chance to keep up.
</p>
<p>
  In my better world,
  every professional programmer reads
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Linkers-Kaufmann-Software-Engineering-Programming/dp/1558604960/">great</a>
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Classic-Operating-Systems-Processing-Distributed/dp/038795113X/">books</a>
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Garbage-Collection-Handbook-Management-Algorithms/dp/1420082795/">like</a>
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Software-Build-Systems-Principles-Experience/dp/0321717287/">these</a>
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052/">ones</a>
  as part of their training,
  along with <a href="http://aosabook.org/en/index.html">informed analyses of real software architectures</a>.
</p>
<p>
  In my better world,
  the standard undergraduate course on software engineering teaches students
  <a href="{{'/2014/10/02/a-better-software-engineering-course/' | relative_url}}">how to gather and analyze data from real projects</a>.
  They then expect arguments about design patterns, agile development, and the like
  to be backed up by evidence instead of shouting.
</p>
<p>
  In my better world,
  image coordinate systems put (0,0) in the lower left corner.
</p>
<p>
  In my better world,
  the ACM and IEEE have been leaders in adoption of open access publishing
  instead of laggards.
</p>
<p>
  In my better world,
  computing education research gets as much funding as data science,
  because people believe that teaching children to program is as important as getting them to click on ads.
</p>
<p>
  In my better world,
  everything uses a USB connector–including my iPhone.
</p>
<p>
  In my better world,
  we used the Internet to create federated systems
  instead of unaccountable single points of failure.
</p>
<p>
  In my better world,
  I can get through a weekend's reading
  without being reminded of every one of these shortcomings of ours.
