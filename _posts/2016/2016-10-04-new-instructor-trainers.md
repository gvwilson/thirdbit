We are very pleased to welcome Karin Lagesen
and Anelda van der Walt
to our team of instructor trainers.
Karin and Anelda have been very active in all of our activities–Karin
is now in her second year on the Steering Committee,
and Anelda has been the driving force behind our growth in South Africa–and
we are very grateful that they are willing to give even more to our community.
