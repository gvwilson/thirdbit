    <p>Never teach alone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No lesson survives first contact with learners.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody will be more excited about the lesson than you are.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every lesson is too short from the teacher's point of view and too long from the learner's.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Never hesitate to sacrifice truth for clarify.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every mistake is a lesson.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>"I learned this a long time ago" is not the same as "this is easy".</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ninety percent of magic consists of knowing one extra thing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can't help everyone, but you can always help someone.</p>
