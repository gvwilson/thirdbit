We are pleased to announce that Harriet Dashnow
and Daniel Chen
have agreed to take over maintenance of the R inflammation lesson.
Our thanks to them for volunteering,
and to John Blischak
and Denis Haine
for all their hard work over the past year and more.

We are also grateful to Erik Bray,
who has volunteered to take over maintenance of
our Windows installer.
As we have grown,
we have come to depend on our community to do more than just teach
(and yes, I just said "just").
If you would like to get involved in maintaining lessons,
mentoring new instructors,
or other non-teaching tasks,
please give us a shout.
