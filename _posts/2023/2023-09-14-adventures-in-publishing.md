Years ago,
I talked several dozen people into writing a chapter each
about the open source applications they had built.
We had a publisher lined up for the resulting book,
but when we delivered the manuscript they said,
"It's too big—you'll have to cut half of it."
I wasn't willing to throw people's hard work away,
so in the end we self-published [*The Architecture of Open Source Applications*][aosa].

Twelve years later,
those chapters still get more visitors every day
than [*It Will Never Work in Theory*][nwit]
and [this site][third] (which hosts both of the *Software Design by Example* books)
combined,
which I guess goes to show that William Goldman was write:
nobody knows anything.
