When I was young,
I got up early to go out and pick blackberries several times each summer.
My mum turned some into jam,
but she always froze a pail or two
so that she could make me a pie for my birthday.
Every year it was sweet and tart and bursting with flavor—exactly what I needed
in BC in January
when the sky had been gray for weeks and everything felt damp.

[Mum died three years ago][mum]
just a few days before she was going to come to visit us in Toronto.
As we were sorting out her home I found two buckets of blackberries in her freezer.
I don't know who picked them for her,
but I'd like to think she was planning to smuggle them onto the plane somehow
so she could make me a birthday pie.

My wife used the last of them this afternoon.
I'm sixty years old;
the seeds will get stuck in my teeth and I'll probably need to wipe my eyes,
but it'll be worth it for just a little taste of those long-ago summers.
