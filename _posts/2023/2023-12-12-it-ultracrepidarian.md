Yesterday I [wrote][meetings] about using a lesson on how to run a meeting
to get undergrad software engineers to think about
the way that "who interrupts who" reflects and reveals social status within groups.
I really want to create a similar lesson about grading—if students are working in teams, then:

-   How do performance evaluations typically work in tech companies?

-   How is grading in undergrad courses similar and different?

-   How much say should teams have in how they're graded,
    or should every team be graded the same way?
    (This seems like a good moment to introduce some ideas from Scott's *Seeing Like a State*.)

-   How should individual team members be graded
    given that the instructor can't watch them all 24/7 to see who's actually doing what?

-   (How) can we stop people from gaming the grading system?

-   How do we give fair credit for "invisible work"?
    Conversely,
    (how) can we design a system that doesn't over-score some kinds of work
    just because it's more visible?

-   Who gets to decide, and why them?

What's stopping me is that I don't know nearly enough about the research on this to start.
Without someone who's familiar with the literature as a writing partner,
what I produce will almost certainly be
yet another [ultracrepidarian][ultracrepidarian] middle-aged guy saying,
"It seems obvious to me that…"
This is another illustration of why these lessons will be hard to write:
programmers like me don't know the research,
and the people who do mostly don't know how to talk to programmers.
