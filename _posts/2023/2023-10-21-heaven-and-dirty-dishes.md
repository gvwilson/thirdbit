After [my sister died][sylvia],
my mother told me that she thought heaven was empty.
I told her I was surprised to hear her say this:
didn't she think *anyone* deserved to be there?
"Oh yes, lots of people," she said,
"But anyone who does will get to the Pearly Gates and say,
thank you very much for the invitation,
but there's still work to be done."
She was the sort of woman who wouldn't leave a child's birthday party
until the dishes were washed and put away,
even if it was someone else's child and someone else's house,
and I wonder sometimes if [the things I've done][directions]
have just been my way of washing dishes.

Time to make another cup of tea.
If you came in peace, be welcome;
if not, be damned with you.
