Things I look for in an engineering manager's CV during initial screening:

1. How many products/projects have you seen through to delivery?
   How large or small were they (features/codebase),
   and which were greenfield vs. maintenance/extension?

1. How large/small are the teams you have led, and for how long?
   What was their range of experience?
   How many were already formed when you arrived, and how many did you assemble (e.g., you handled recruiting)?

1. What range of activities were you responsible for?
   E.g., were you only managing developers or did you have QA, PM, etc. under you?
   Did you define OKRs or were they handed to you?

1. What tools and technologies did your teams use?
   Which of these were you hands-on with?

I don't pay much attention to the names of the processes people used
because everybody says "agile" or "scrum" and means something different.
However,
I do look for mentions of "ran daily/weekly standups",
"developed performance and delivery metrics",
and other things an external observer could see.
I also pay a lot of attention to conference talks, meetup presentations, guest lectures in college courses, etc.:
I know I'm biased, but I think they're a good sign that people can communicate.
