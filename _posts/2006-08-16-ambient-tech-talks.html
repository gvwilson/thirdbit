<a href="http://www.ambientvector.com">Ambient Vector</a> has started a series of tech talks.  Their first guest was <a href="http://suthakamal.blogspot.com/2006/08/ambients-first-techtalk.html">Nick Koudas</a>, from <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca">U of T</a>.  May seem like a small thing, but there haven't been as many ties between the university and local software companies (other than giants like IBM) as there ought to be --- I'm pleased to see that changing.
