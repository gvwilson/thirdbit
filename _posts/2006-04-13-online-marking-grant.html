<a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~campbell">Jennifer Campbell</a> and I just heard that we've been awarded an ITCDF grant by the <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a>, which will let us hire a couple of student programmers over the summer to complete an online system for reviewing and grading.  Very excited---it'll be a chance to do some raaaather cool things.
