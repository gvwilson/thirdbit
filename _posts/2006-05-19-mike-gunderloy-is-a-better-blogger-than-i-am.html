Mike Gunderloy's blog at <a href="http://www.larkware.com/">Larkware</a> is always worth reading.  Today's items include <a href="http://onstartups.com/Home/tabid/3339/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/607/MakingMoneyWithSoftwareInAdditionToUsabilityThinkBuyability.aspx">Usability vs. Buyability</a> and <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/karlseguin/archive/2006/05/18/144881.aspx">Have I Inherited a Disaster?</a> Coincidentally, <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/drproject">DrProject</a> still isn't ready for release because of packaging issues: while some people are able to install it in 15 minutes or less on a clean Linux box, others have wrestled for hours without being able to make it run. I'm tempted to slap the word <a href="http://farm.tucows.com/blog/Platforms/Web/_archives/2006/3/6/1799867.html">beta</a> on it and release it anyway, but (a) that's cheating, and (b) it feels like we're <em>so</em> close.
