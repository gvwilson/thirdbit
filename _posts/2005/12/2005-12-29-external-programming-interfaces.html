<a href="http://www.artima.com/forums/flat.jsp?forum=106&thread=142428">This article</a>, by Eamonn McManus, is a nice little summary of API design principles.  It contains a bit of motherhood and apple pie---nobody would ever set out to make an API difficult to learn or hard to use, for example---but the specifics are good (particularly the discussion of why interfaces are often the wrong thing to use).  The article contains a link to <a href="http://openide.netbeans.org/tutorial/api-design.html">this essay</a> at the NetBeans site, which talks about some of the same ideas in more detail.

Together, the articles got me thinking: why don't we ever talk about or document a module's <em>external</em> programming interface (which I hereby dub "XPI")?  This is the classes, methods, and system calls that the module depends on; more particularly, it is their semantics.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract">Design by contract</a> allows a piece of code to specify what it provides; allowing that code to specify what it requires using similar pre- and post-conditions would be a big help in managing the asynchronous evolution of libraries that makes <a href="http://www.postmodernprogramming.org/">postmodern programming</a> so hard.
