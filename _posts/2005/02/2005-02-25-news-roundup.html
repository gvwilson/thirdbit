Three pieces of news:

A paper by Vlad Mnih, Jonathan Taylor, Lee Zamparo, Paul Gries, and Greg Wilson describing their addition of memory visualization to DrJava has been accepted by the Frontiers in Education 2005 conference.  This work was done as a 49X project in the summer of 2004; congratulations, guys.

Prof. Karen Reid is speaking at 2:00 p.m. on Friday at SIGCSE 2005 about our experiences using CVS to manage undergraduate programming assignments.

Jonathan Taylor (a former 49Xer) is giving a talk on "CAPSGEN and CAPSID: Tools for Genotyping and Molecular Breeding based on DNA sequence information from multiple individuals/ecotypes/strains" on Tuesday, March 1, in MSB 2173, at 4:30 p.m.
