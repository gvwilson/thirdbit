<p>One of my apartment-mates back in grad school was an immunologist.  She told me once about the first rule of public health: it's only a cure if people will actually do it, or use it.  For example, abstinence is <em>not</em> an effective way to prevent HIV/AIDS, or teenage pregnancy, because in practice, people won't abstain.</p>

<p>I've thought about the difference between "works in the lab" and "works in the field" many times in the context of software engineering.  Take the idea of doing rigorous up-front design using UML, for example; it sounds good, but I don't know anyone who actually <em>does</em> it day-to-day, so I don't count it as a "solution".  In contrast, while purists may sneer at test-driven development (TDD) as "hacking to solve hacking's problems", a growing number of people actually do it.</p>

<p>Which brings us to <a href="http://futuremail.bensinclair.com/home/index">Future Email</a>, a new web service that'll send you messages at specified times to remind you to do things.  We all use email as a to-do list to some extent; half of the messages in my inbox right now are things I'm supposed to take care of.  But since it's easy to overlook things that have been lying around for a while, Ben Sinclair has come up with the idea of pinging people when they most need the reminder.  Simple, and a good fit for the way we actually work.</p>
