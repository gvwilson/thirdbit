This <a href="http://news.com.com/Opening+doors+for+women+in+computing/2100-1022_3-5557311.html">C|Net story</a> is depressing reading:
<blockquote><em>...the female share of bachelor's degrees in computer science dropped from 37 percent in 1985 to 28 percent in 2001. And while women comprised 33 percent of information technology professionals in 1990, that figure was down to 26 percent in 2002... The drop is puzzling in part because women are making progress in related areas such as the natural sciences.</em></blockquote>
As Michelle Levesque and I said in <a href="http://www.sdmagazine.com/documents/s=9411/sdm0411b/sdm0411b.html?temp=OVpcxeRxuV">an article</a> last year, the situation's even worse in open source.  Hey, I wonder if it's on the agenda for this year's <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005/">O'Reilly Open Source Conference</a>?  Hm, they seem to have left it out... again.
