A sociologist I once did some work for once told me that all human activities could be classified as belonging to one of a small number of natural timescales, which he described as:
<ul>
	<li>continuous;</li>
	<li>sip of coffee;</li>
	<li>fresh pot;</li>
	<li>tomorrow; and</li>
	<li>sometime.</li>
</ul>
A continuous activity is one that you're completely absorbed in, like typing a blog posting. The "sip of coffee" category includes things like quick compiles, launching OpenOffice, and other activities that give you enough time to check on a background task ("I wonder if I have mail?"), but not enough for you to go and do something else.  "Fresh pot" is rebuilding PostgreSQL from source---you park the task, go and think about something else for a while (possibly forgetting details of what you were doing), and come back some time later.  "Tomorrow" and "sometime" are timescales that involve planning; the difference between them is that "sometime" requires you to put time into planning (i.e., the main task generates meta-tasks).

The sociologist's argument was that revolutionary technologies (or programs) are ones that move an activity from one category to another.  Take desktop publishing, for example---what had been a "sometime" became a "fresh pot" (early systems would sit there and think a while to format a page), then "continuous" (WYSIWYG on first-generation Macs).  Email did something similar to communication, and so on.

I was reminded of all this yet again when I read Mike Clark's recent post on <a href="http://www.clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2005/02/25">how Google Maps is changing the way he works</a>.  By pulling several things together, it moves a bunch of objective-oriented tasks (how do I print the handouts for my course? where will I stay while I'm in Indianapolis?) down a category, as a group.

I think (well, I hope) that <a href="http://projects.edgewall.com/trac">Trac</a> will do the same thing for undergraduate team programming.  From what I've see in the last few years, ignorance isn't the only reason that students don't work like professionals; the other is that when you're juggling four or five courses, you simply can't afford tasks that are in high-cost categories.  It remains to be seen whether we can push 'em down the stack, but I'm hopeful...
