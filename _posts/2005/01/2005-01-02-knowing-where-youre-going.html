One of the hardest things in any project is to figure out exactly
what you're trying to accomplish.  This template is intended to help
software development teams do that by forcing them to state what
problem they're trying to solve, who it affects, and why their
solution is a good one.  It is taken from:
<blockquote>Gary Pollice, Liz Augustine, Chris Lowe, and Jas Madhur: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321199502">Software
Development for Small Teams: A RUP-Centric Approach</a>.
Addison-Wesley, 2003, 0321199502.</blockquote>
The bits on the left, on gray, are boilerplate; the bits on the
right, on white, are to be replaced with something
project-specific.  I will post again in two weeks once students'
vision statements are on the web.
