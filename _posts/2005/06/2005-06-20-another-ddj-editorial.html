I seem to have a lot to say these days... ;-)  <a href="http://www.ddj.com/documents/s=9776/ddj1119213027726/">This editorial</a> on <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/http:www.ddj.com">Doctor Dobb's Journal</a>'s web site is about what to do with the coming wave of multi-core CPUs.  (Hint: provide better debugger support.)
