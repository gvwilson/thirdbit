An editorial I wrote on <a href="http://www.ddj.com/documents/s=9776/ddj1118700393648/">selling open source</a> is up at <a href="http://www.ddj.com">Doctor Dobb's Journal</a>.  It uses the state of Python web programming frameworks to make a broader point about the need for more egoless programming in the open source world.
