<p>From our "wish I'd thought of that years ago" department: Doug Hertle was so worried about his roommates getting into his ice cream that he <a href="http://www.dougydoug.com/if_nothing_else.htm">wrote</a> to Ben &amp; Jerry's to suggest that they sell their product in padlocked, stainless steel containers.  They've now met him halfway: you can buy an <a href="http://store.benjerry.com/pintlock.html">ice cream bucket lock</a> on their website.</p>

<p>(Doug also suggested making children's clothes out of Swiffer cloths.  He says that since kids get into everything anyway, you might as well use them to clean the house...)</p>
