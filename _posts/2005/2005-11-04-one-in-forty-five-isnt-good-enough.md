<a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~pgries/">Paul Gries</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~arnold/">Arnold Rosenbloom</a>, and I spoke to the Toronto Java Users' Group meeting this past Tuesday about Java as a teaching language.  It was fun, and the questions and comments from the audience gave me lots to think about—as did the fact that of the 45 people there, only one was female.  That, and <a href="http://www.misbehaving.net/2005/11/i_have_no_words.html">this</a>, and hearing about schools with a 60:1 male/female ratio, makes me feel weary.  (For the record, the ratio in my project course stands at 3:1.)
