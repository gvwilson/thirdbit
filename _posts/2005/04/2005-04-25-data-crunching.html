At the risk of turning this blog into adware, my book on Data Crunching is now available from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0974514071">Amazon</a>, or directly from the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/gwd/index.html">Pragmatic Programmers</a>.  Personally, I think it's beautiful:
