<p>An <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/04/book_sales_as_a.html">interesting piece</a> by Tim O'Reilly on trends in book sales, and how they reflect (or forecast?) trends in technology.  Interesting that Python book sales are now 2/3 of Perl sales, though both are down in absolute numbers.</p>
