As regular readers know, I supervise senior undergraduate software engineering projects on a semi-regular basis at the University of Toronto.  I keep thinking that <em>someone</em> must have written <em>something</em> for students (and supervisors) explaining how to do this, but every time I've gone looking, I've come away dissatisfied.  The four nearest misses to date are:
<ul>
  <li>Ludi's Student Survival Guide to Managing Group Projects: concise, and useful, but very brief.</li>
  <li>Dawson's Essence of Computing Projects and Ricketts' Managing Your Software Project: out of print, somewhat dated, and very dry.</li>
  <li>Fincher et al's Computer Science Project Work: a stamp-collecting compare-and-contrast look at different kinds of project courses.</li>
</ul>
One criticism of all of them is that they are virtually tool-free: in my experience, students want to know <em>how</em> to do things at least as much as <em>what</em> to do.  An entry-level cross between Doar's Practical Development Environments, and Fogel's Producing Open Source Software would fit the bill nicely: if anyone knows of such a beast (either in print or on line), I'd welcome a pointer.

Update: Dawson has <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321263553">a new book out</a>, but I haven't seen a copy yet.
