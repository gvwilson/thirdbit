There's a new <a href="http://www.subtextual.org/demo1.html">demo</a> of Jonathan Edwards' <a href="http://www.subtextual.org">Subtext</a> system online.  This is the best example I've seen yet of an <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/~gvwilson/papers/queue2004-extprog.pdf">extensible programming system</a>.  It's pretty cool---once you stop insisting that programs have to be directly presentable as ASCII strings, many new thoughts become possible.

Quote: "It's good to remember that with practice, you can even learn to read Perl.   Humans are not good at abstract thinking, but they're great at pattern recognition. I think it's a win to trade one for the other."

(And to follow up on the "many new thoughts become possible" meme, I once saw a talk by <a href="http://www.world-of-dawkins.com/">Richard Dawkins</a> on "The Evolution of Evolvability".  Dawkins' thesis was that some evolutionary changes give evolution new things to act on---segmented bodies, for example, allow for specialization of segments and limbs.  Code-in-database systems almost certainly have this property.)
