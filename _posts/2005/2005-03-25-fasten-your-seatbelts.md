From <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/03/25.html#a1202">Jon Udell's weblog</a>:
<blockquote>Civilization took a great leap forward when we learned how to write stuff down. Now we're learning to film our stories and to TiVo them. Fasten your seat belt.</blockquote>
Coincidentally, I was commiserating with a fellow professor yesterday about the gulf between what universities have first-year computer science students do ("Sort a list of strings") and what many of those same students do on their own time ("Create a Flash animation of three turtles wishing my boyfriend a happy birthday").  I guess it all comes down to Toffler's Law: "The future always arrives too soon, and in the wrong order."
