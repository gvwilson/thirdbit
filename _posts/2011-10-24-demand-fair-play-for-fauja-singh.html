To whom it may concern,
I was very disappointed to hear that you have decided to deny Fauja Singh the record for being the world's oldest marathon runner [1].  His age is well enough documented to satisfy the British Home Office (grantors of his passport) --- surely that is as reliable as anything else he could produce?  On behalf of everyone inspired by his courage and determination, I ask you to reconsider.

Sincerely,
Dr. Gregory V. Wilson
