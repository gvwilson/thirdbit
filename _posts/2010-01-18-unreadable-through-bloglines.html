Bloglines apparently doesn't like this feed:
<blockquote>Bloglines has encountered an error trying to fetch the latest version of this feed. Bloglines handles errors automatically, no action is required by you. The error was:

The feed does not appear to exist. This can be caused by the feed URL being incorrect, or it can be caused by a configuration issue with the server hosting the feed. If this error continues, you should check the feed URL and, if it is wrong, subscribe to the correct URL.</blockquote>
Google Reader and Safari's built-in reader are happy with it---any suggestions?
