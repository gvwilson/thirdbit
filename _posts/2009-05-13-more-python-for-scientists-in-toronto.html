As well as the <a href="http://softwarecarpentry.wordpress.com">Software Carpentry</a> course we're running in Toronto July 13-31 this year, the Physics department is organizing a one-week <a href="http://trizpug.org/boot-camp/pycamp-toronto-2009/">Python Boot Camp</a> July 13-17 for $375 (Canadian).  Who knew we were so fashionable? :-)
