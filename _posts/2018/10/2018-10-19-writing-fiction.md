My first two books were on parallel programming.
A few hundred people bought each,
but they were quickly out of date.
More people read <em>Beautiful Code</em> and its successors,
but again,
their content aged quickly.
This is one of the reasons I write <a href="http://sensibleadventures.com">fiction</a>:
I still hope I can create something that won't be out of date the day after it's finished
and forgotten the day after that.
