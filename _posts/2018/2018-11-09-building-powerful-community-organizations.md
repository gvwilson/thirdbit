I've written about the book *[Building Powerful Community Organizations][bpco]* before,
but I'm very happy to have a reason to do so again:
I finally got to meet its author in person.
Michael Jacoby Brown has been a community organizer for decades;
he has recruited and trained hundreds of volunteers that have fought for
fire fighters, school teachers, and people who just want a fair deal.
Now in his seventies,
he's still going strong,
and still full of practical, actionable advice on how to make change happen.
If you haven't already read *[BPCO][bpco]*, you should;
if you have,
and you found it useful,
please share it with anyone you know
who wants a better world but isn't sure where to start.
