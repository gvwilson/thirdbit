title: "Harper: Lesson Discovery and Aggregation"
---

After feedback from several people,
I have updated the proposal for a lesson discovery and aggregation system
(now called "Harper")
and put it in [its own page]({{site.github.url}}/harper/).
The key differences between this version and earlier ones are:

1.  This version is much shorter.
1.  It describes a workflow people can use to ask authors and instructors to register their lessons.
1.  It focuses on what instructors would need to re-interpret and remix lessons
    rather than deliver them as-is.
1.  Some of the background thinking has been stripped out;
    if you want the whole story,
    please see [these][twelve-percent] [three][thirteen-percent] [posts][fourteen-percent].

If you can spare 15 minutes,
please have a look at [the sample `lesson.md` file]({{site.github.url}}/harper/#s:proposal)
and let me know what you think:

-   Would you write one?
-   Would you know *how* to write one?
-   Would the people you teach with be willing and able to write one?
    (This is probably the most important question.)
-   Is there anything you absolutely, positively need as an instructor that isn't included in this proposal?
-   Is there anything you believe is unworkable (such as inferring prerequisites from terms that are used but not defined)?

I'm grateful to [everyone who has given feedback]({{site.github.url}}/harper/#s:acknowledgments),
and to Peter Quill for show us that
[you only need twelve percent of a plan][guardians-video] to save the galaxy.
Comments on [the proposal page]({{site.github.url}}/harper) (not here)
or [email to me](mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com) would be greatly appreciated.
