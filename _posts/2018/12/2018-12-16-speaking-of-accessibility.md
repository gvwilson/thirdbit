title: "Speaking of Accessibility"
---

[Elizabeth Patitsas](https://patitsas.github.io/)
has put together
a truly awesome reading list on
[the social context of computer science education](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F1z8BvKpMqz0MdwagjhG6X6R4sVFHLhY52dSgssnE4I/).
It's full of pointers to important works and ideas,
but looking through it reminded me that "awesome" means "extremely impressive *or daunting*".
Most programmers are never going to tackle it,
any more than they would tackle Smith, Marx, Keynes, or Tversky & Kahneman in the original.

I think that if we want Silicon Valley to change---if we want
software developers to be aware of the broader impact of their work and care about it---we
need something like *Freakonomics*, but for good.
We need something that is accessible to people with technical skills,
but who have no background in social science,
that explains:

- why racial discrimination persists when neoliberal economics tells us it shouldn't because it's inefficient;
- why so many Americans think that being able to shoot children is an inalienable right; and
- why taking race, gender, orientation, and other factors into account when hiring is not discrimination.

[My attempt to crowdsource such a book]({{site.github.url}}/ideas/#sex-and-drugs-and-guns-and-code-what-everyone-in-tech-needs-to-know-about-politics-economics-and-power) failed,
but I think it would have far more impact than anything I've done in the last thirty years.
