I'm very pleased to announce that we're offering a one-day workshop on how to teach tech (and other things)
at the Toronto Public Library on March 2, 2019,
and that the workshop will be co-taught by Stanford's [Amy Hodge](https://profiles.stanford.edu/amy-hodge).
Registration will officially open on February 2;
details will go up on [this page](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDMEVT375728&R=EVT375728),
and I'll reannounce here.
This workshop is open to the general public,
and we hope to see you there.
