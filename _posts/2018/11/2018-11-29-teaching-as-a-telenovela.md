title: "Teaching as a Telenovela"
---

I have never been a fan of a daytime soap opera (that I'm willing to admit in public),
but I once had a chance to see one being filmed,
and I came away with nothing but respect for their writers, actors, directors, and crew.
Five hour-long episodes a week,
year after year,
is a hell of a slog:
where a Broadway actor might have weeks to learn her lines and get into character,
a headline character in a *telenovela* gets one read-through before being put in front of a camera.

Talking to Garrett Grolemund today,
I realized that's the situation most teachers are in.
We don't have time to practice dozens of times before getting on stage.
We don't have time---or rather, our institutions don't give us time---to
workshop our materials and try out a few variations in front of small audiences
before giving our real performance.
And unlike a Broadway production,
we don't get to do the same thing over and over again;
best case,
we'll perform a lesson two or three times in one week for different sections of a course,
then set it aside for months until we teach that course again.

I'm still thinking about what this implies for [re-using lessons]({{site.github.url}}/2016/04/29/why-teachers-dont-collaborate.html)...
