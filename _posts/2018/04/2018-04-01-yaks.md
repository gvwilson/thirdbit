I'd like to [teach scientists how to
program](https://software-carpentry.org), but that would be a lot
easier to do if we had better software tools to offer them.

I'd like to teach undergraduates [how to design better software
tools](http://aosabook.org), but that would be a lot easier to do if
they knew more about software engineering.

I'd like to teach undergraduates [an evidence-based introduction to
software engineering](http://neverworkintheory.org), but that would be
a lot easier to do if more people knew how to teach well.

I'd like to teach everyone [how to teach
well](http://third-bit.com/teaching/), but that would be a lot easier
to do if people in power actually valued and rewarded good teaching.

I'd like to teach people who *don't* have power [where it comes from
and how to take it](http://teachtogether.tech), but—ah. OK, I guess
I've found the yak I need to shave.
