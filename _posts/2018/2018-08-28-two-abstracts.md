I recently read and enjoyed this paper:

> David Weintrop, Alexandria K. Hansen, Danielle B. Harlow, and Diana Franklin:
> "Starting from Scratch: Outcomes of Early Computer Science Learning Experiences and Implications for What Comes Next".
> *Proc. ICER'18*, 2018, <https://doi.org/10.1145/3230977.3230988>

Its authors found that high school students learning programming do better with
block-based languages than with text-based languages, and the impact is greatest
for female and minority students.  I really want to include this result in the
next version of *[Teaching Tech Together](http://teachtogether.tech)*, so I
contacted the lead author and asked for help summing up the conclusions.  The
paper's original abstract is:

> Visual block-based programming environments (VBBPEs) such as Scratch and Alice
> are increasingly being used in introductory computer science lessons across
> elementary school grades.  These environments, and the curricula that
> accompany them, are designed to be developmentally-appropriate and engaging
> for younger learners but may introduce challenges for future computer science
> educators.  Using the final projects of 4th, 5th, and 6th grade students who
> completed an introductory curriculum using a VBBPE, this paper focuses on
> patterns that show success within the context of VBBPEs but could pose
> potential challenges for teachers of follow-up computer science instruction.
> This paper focuses on three specific strategies observed in learners'
> projects: (1) wait blocks being used to manage program execution, (2) the use
> of event-based programming strategies to produce parallel outcomes, and (3)
> the coupling of taught concepts to curricular presentation.  For each of these
> outcomes, we present data on how the course materials supported them, what
> learners achieved while enacting them, and the implications the strategy poses
> for future educators.  We then discuss possible design and pedagogical
> responses.  The contribution of this work is that it identifies early computer
> science learning strategies, contextualizes them within
> developmentally-appropriate environments, and discusses their implications
> with respect to future pedagogy.  This paper advances our understanding of the
> role of VBBPEs in introductory computing and their place within the larger
> K-12 computer science trajectory.

The final summary is:

> A growing number of studies have found that block-based programming tools like
> Scratch are a more effective way to introduce kids to programming than
> traditional text-based tools.  What's more, the gains in performance are
> largest among female students and students from underrepresented minorities.
> People are starting to notice --- for example, the new AP Computer Science
> Principles exam asks students questions using both blocks and text --- so if
> you are teaching programming at the K-12 level, start your learners with
> blocks.

I don't think the second is a dumbed-down version of the first, any more than I
think blocks are dumbed-down text.  Instead, I think they are different tools
intended for different audiences with different priorities.  The first is aimed
at the authors' fellow academics; the second is for busy practitioners who want
to know what they should do or change today.  It's like the [research
summaries](https://www.cancer.net/research-and-advocacy/research-summaries) I
read when my siblings and my father had cancer, and I think researchers would
have a lot more impact if they wrote actionable briefs like this for their work.

[It Will Never Work In Theory](http://neverworkintheory.org/) was our attempt to
do this for empirical software engineering; it didn't catch on, but maybe it
would be worth trying again for computing education research.
