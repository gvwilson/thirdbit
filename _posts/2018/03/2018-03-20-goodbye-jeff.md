In the end you think about the beginning.
We weren't close as children,
but he moved to Ottawa to start university the same year I went there for my first job,
and meeting each other again as adults,
we discovered that we liked each other.
I remember arguing about the nature of beauty,
and going to see *Stop Making Sense* half a dozen times,
and crashing on his couch in later years whenever I came back to Canada.
I remember the first time I met the wonderful woman he married,
and holding his newborn sons,
and endless games of chess.
I remember him coming down to Boston to spend a few days with me
when I didn't realize myself how much I needed someone to talk to,
and all the times he and his family made me feel welcome when I had nowhere else to go.
I remember him making the woman I married feel like family,
how he paid his debts even when he was facing ruin,
and how he never stopped trying to create something amazing.
I remember the look on his face last November when he told me he had cancer again,
and that the last thing he said to me was,
"Remember, you still have a lot of good times in front of you."

Goodbye, Jeff.
I promised you I wouldn't regret anything,
but I'm going to miss you so much.
