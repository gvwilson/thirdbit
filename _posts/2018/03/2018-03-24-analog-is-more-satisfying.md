title: "Analog is More Satisfying"

I'm organizing my thoughts about other people's thoughts for
[the next revision]({{site.github.url}}/2018/03/20/plan-for-version-3.html)
of *[How to Teach Programming (and Other Things)](http://third-bit.com/teaching/)*,
and have found yet again that moving lines of text around in Emacs
isn't nearly as satisfying as shuffling scraps of paper on a table.

Categories in this not-very-scientific card sort of 206 new citations include:

This is a skewed representation of what Version 3 will contain,
since topics that are already adequately covered are under-represented in the new citations.
I'm still looking for more material on free-range teaching (e.g., bootcamps and weekend workshops);
as always,
please [mail me](mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com?subject=How%20to%20Teach%20Programming)
your thoughts and suggestions.
