William Gibson once said that our children would find it quaint that
we bothered to distinguish the real from the virtual.  Now that the
hype about MOOCs has died down, we can see more clearly that on-demand
delivery of automated lessons is just one of many ways to use the web
to make education better for students and teachers alike.  I'm really
excited about [Edthena](https://www.edthena.com/),
[CourseSource](https://www.coursesource.org/), the upcoming *[Journal
of Open Source Education](http://jose.theoj.org/)*, and dozens of
other "hopeful monsters" in educational technology, and thanks to a
lot of hard work from Gabriel, Rémi, Rayna, Kate, Damien, and Ian, our
contribution has finally been published:

> Gabriel A. Devenyi, Rémi Emonet, Rayna M. Harris, Kate L. Hertweck,
> Damien Irving, Ian Milligan, and Greg Wilson (2018) "Ten simple
> rules for collaborative lesson development." *PLoS Computational
> Biology* 14(3), https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005963.

Its appearance marks the end of a chapter in my life: I had planned to
do a companion paper on collaborative lesson *delivery*, but my focus
has shifted to [community organizing](http://teachtogether.tech) and
to passing on [what I've learned](http://third-bit.com/teaching/) to
other free-range instructors.  (And to be honest, getting this paper
through PLoS's production pipeline was so much more work than writing
it that it'll be a while before I can face the task again.)

I hope you find it useful; if you do, or if you have experiences or
ideas of your own to share, I'd enjoy hearing from you.
