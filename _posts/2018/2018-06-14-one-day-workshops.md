Over the past year,
I've run eight workshops on how to teach
for various groups and companies in the Toronto area.
Their content is drawn from the [Carpentries instructor training](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/),
but cut down to one day;
in outline,
it covers:

- The differences between novices and competent practitioners, what mental models are, and formative assessment
  - Participants create and critique multiple choice questions as an exercise
- Expertise, concept maps, and how the limits to human cognition shape lesson design (i.e., 7&plusmn;2)
  - Participants create concept maps
- A recorded teaching exercise in groups of 3
  - I have participants put their feedback on the whiteboard as a group, then derive a rubric from it for use in the afternoon's teaching exercise
- Lunch
- Motivation (self-efficacy, utility, and community) and demotivation (unpredictability, unfairness, and indifference)
  - We go through some scenarios in which people were demotivated and discuss what could have been done *afterward* to make it right
- The second live teaching exercise (using the rubric from the morning)
- Evidence-based methods to accelerate learning (draw from the [Learning Scientists](http://learningscientists.org)' excellent material)
  - Think-pair-share on kinds of exercises that can be used in classes
- The lesson design process and the mechanics of collaborative lesson development
  - We don't go into details of Jekyll templates on GitHub, but talk instead about mechanics, credit, etc.
- Wrap up

It makes for a very full day, and we often don't cover everything, but it seems to work pretty well.
My next workshop for staff at Toronto Public Library is in a week and a half,
and I'm thinking of running one for all comers in Toronto in July if I can find space.
If you're interested in taking part,
or in having me run it for your group or your company,
please [give me a shout](mailto:{{site.author.email}}) -
I learn at lot from each one,
and always enjoy doing it.
