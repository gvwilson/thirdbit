I want a cartoon like this,
but instead of being labelled "socialist" and "anarchist",
the people pointing at the stars are labelled "MOOCs" and "peer instruction",
and the building is labelled "school",
because we're not going to get any meaningful change in education
unless we tackle the political aspects head-on.
