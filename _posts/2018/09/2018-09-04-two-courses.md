[Toby Hodges](https://twitter.com/tbyhdgs) and I are pleased to announce
the release of Version 0.2 (ish) of [JavaScript versus Data Science](https://software-tools-in-javascript.github.io/js-vs-ds/).
It's still point-form notes,
and there are still a lot of gaps and FIXMEs,
but we hope it's enough to give an idea of what we think researchers who already know a bit of Python or R
ought to know about JavaScript.
We would be very grateful for your feedback.

I'm also pleased to announce Version 0.1 of [Still Magic](https://merely-useful.github.io/still-magic/),
which is meant to cover next steps in software development
for people who already know what's in [the Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/)' lessons.
It covers:

- automating analyses using Make
- unit testing
- testing data analysis pipelines
- logging and configuration
- publishing a static web site with GitHub Pages
- using a branch-per-feature workflow with Git
- setting up continuous integration with Travis-CI
- good programming style and documentation
- refactoring to improve code quality
- how to organize the files in a medium-sized project
- making a project inclusive
- creating and managing packages
- 21st Century publishing

Again, it's still point-form notes,
but feedback on scope, errors, omissions, and the like would be very helpful.
