title: Weak Failure, Strong Failure, and Butter Tarts
---

[Dr. Veronika Cheplygina](https://veronikach.com/) recently
[interviewed me](https://veronikach.com/how-i-fail/how-i-fail-greg-wilson-phd93-computer-science/)
for her series "How I Fail".
We discuss weak failure ("I put in a lot of work and nobody got much out of it"),
strong failure ("I put in a lot of work and did harm that could have been avoided"),
the value of sharing failures online,
and butter tarts;
I hope you find it useful.
