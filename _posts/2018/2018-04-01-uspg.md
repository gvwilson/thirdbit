Back in 2007, I tried to condense everything I had learned from
supervising undergraduate thesis projects at the University of Toronto
and elsewhere into a short, sharp handbook for students (and their
instructors).  I called it *The Undergraduate Software Project Guide*,
but didn't manage to finish it before leaving academia to re-start
Software Carpentry.

Recently, though, someone asked for guidance on supervising
undergraduate projects, so I dug it out, reformatted it, and stuck it
in a GitHub repository. Skimming it, I was struck by how rusty
its discussion of tools now seems: there's no mention of Git or
GitHub, it focuses on Java rather than JavaScript, and so on. I'm also
embarrassed by its opinion-to-evidence ratio: it makes dozens of
definitive pronouncements about what works and what doesn't, but
doesn't cite studies or data to back them up.

Some parts have held up pretty well, though: how to run a meeting, how
to figure out what corners to cut, and much of the other human stuff
is as relevant now as it was then.  I need to finish revising *[How to
Teach Programming (and Other Things)][h2tp]* (comments on [the plan
for which][v3] are still very welcome) before I take on any more
projects, but it would be fun to hear what former students who've been
working for a few years now think of its advice.
