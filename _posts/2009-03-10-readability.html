Via <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/">Jon Udell</a> (as so often): Arc90's new <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/2009/03/readability.php">Readability</a> tool is a decluttering widget for browsers that hides screen junk to make pages more readable. Which prompts a new design rule: every good web page should look the same before and after decluttering, just as every well-written program should look the same before and after application of a pretty-printer.
