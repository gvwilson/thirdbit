In 2009-2010, almost 90 students from over a dozen universities across the country earned a course credit by working in teams on a variety of open source projects. Thanks to our friends at <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>, <a href="http://www.oreilly.com">O'Reilly</a>, and <a href="http://cacsaic.org/">CACS</a>, the program is going to run again this fall and winter --- see <a href="http://ucosp.ca/news/2010/06/ucosp-is-expanding/">this announcement</a> for details, and the <a href="http://ucosp.ca">new web site</a> for more information.

So, if you are:
<ul>
	<li>an open source project looking for some talented help,</li>
	<li>a professor in a Canadian computer science department who'd like to help students learn how to work on real software in distributed teams, or</li>
	<li>going to be enrolled in CS at a Canadian university this fall, in your senior year (or grad school), with strong grades and a sense of adventure,</li>
</ul>
then please give the organizers a shout at <a href="mailto:admin@ucosp.ca">admin@ucosp.ca</a>.
