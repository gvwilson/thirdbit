title: "DrProject Status Update"

<a href="http://www.drproject.org">http://www.drproject.org</a> hosts two projects: <code>All</code>, which is for people interested in announcements and general news, and <code>DrProject</code> itself, which is for developers (and those wishing to file tickets against our code).  This message is going out to the list belonging to the former; if you'd like to join the latter, you can do so by following the <code>Preferences</code> link and requesting membership.  (There are about half a dozen messages per day.)

Along with the usual bug fixes, we are working on some new features:
<ol>
	<li>Updating the administration panel to simplify workflow.  Qiyu Zhu and Liz Blankenship have been making good progress, and this will definitely be in the end-of-August release.</li>
	<li>Integration with IRC.  Kosta Zabashta presented this at DemoCamp a few days ago; we have some issues to work out with administering channels, but again, this will be in the end-of-August release.</li>
	<li>Status charts.  Kosta has been working with <a href="http://www.aperte.org">Jeremy Handcock</a> to integrate a few simple charts to show projects' status.  We'll know by the end of July whether this will make it into the next release.</li>
	<li>A configurable ticketing system.  This is the most ambitious of our current projects; Nick Jamil <a href="http://drpnewt.wordpress.com/2008/07/17/newt-screencast-2/">posted a video</a> showing what it can do, and once Jeff Balogh finishes his Dojo-based drag-and-drop form editor, we'll put another one up.  This needs a lot of testing before we put it in a release, but Luke Petrolekas has already started, and if we don't make the end-of-August release, we ought to have it in your hands by Christmas.</li>
</ol>
As always, if you need help getting DrProject installed, please mail <a href="mailto:help@drproject.org">help@drproject.org</a>---we'd be happy to help you out.
