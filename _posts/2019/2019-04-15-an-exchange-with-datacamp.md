I haven't spoken publicly about my experience with DataCamp
out of respect for Kara Woo's privacy.
Now that she has so bravely [come forward](https://twitter.com/kara_woo/status/1114229065509003264),
I can say that after I was fired in June 2018,
DataCamp offered me the equivalent of a month's pay
if I would sign a separation agreement that included a non-disparagement clause.
In the exchange of email that followed I asked on June 22, 2018 for:

> A statement saying that the non-disparagement clause does not preclude me from speaking publicly
> about incidents of sexual harassment and/or sexual assault that occurred during my time at DataCamp
> if the victim or victims should choose to speak publicly about them.

The company responded on July 2 with:

> I can't say whether or not the non-disparagement clause would apply without the specifics (content, details).
> It would depend on the circumstances and forum.
> In any case, nothing limits non-disparagement and it would be at your own peril.

When I replied on July 4 that I was referring specifically to the assault on Kara by a senior company executive,
the company's response on July 6 was:

> Regarding your general question about the application of the non-disparagement provision
> to you speaking publicly about allegations of sexual harassment and/or sexual assault brought by other people,
> unless otherwise required by law,
> **the non-disparagement provision would prohibit such public statements** [emphasis added].
> That said,
> the Company takes all concerns about potential sexual harassment and/or sexual assault seriously.

I felt that the first statement gave the lie to the second,
so I declined the agreement and ended the exchange there.
