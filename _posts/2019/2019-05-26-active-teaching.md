title: "Active Teaching"
---

Educators use the term [active learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning)
to describe learning through play,
group discussion,
one-minute papers,
or anything else that requires learners to use knowledge as they're acquiring it.
Study after study has shown that it's more effective than sitting and listening,
which its proponents refer to as "passive learning".

Garrett Grolemund recently started using analogous phrases
to describe two approaches to teaching.
Where passive learning is listening to,
*passive teaching* is talking at;
while passive learners use new knowledge later,
passive teachers don't modify what they're saying or where they're going as they're teaching.
In contrast,
*active teaching* involves trying out "what if?" scenarios proposed by learners.
or modifying an example on the fly based on learners' interests or puzzled expressions.
In short,
it describes
*situations in which teachers use what they learn from and about students as they learn it*.

I strongly prefer active teaching.
As [I tweeted last week](https://twitter.com/gvwilson/status/1130501444275200002),
I use a sequence of formative assessments like a series of chord changes to improvise over
rather than having what most people would call a lesson plan.
A lot of other excellent instructors prefer a fully worked out lesson plan that they can play like an orchestral score.
In the end,
I suspect most of us choose an approach based on what we've seen most often and on our own personalities,
neither of which guarantees that we're making the absolute best choice.
