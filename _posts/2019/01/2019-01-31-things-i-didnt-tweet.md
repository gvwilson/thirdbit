-   "I don’t mind people DM'ng to ask why I'm mean to Shopify, why I want the great people who work there to leave.
    Fair game to lean on opinions that feel uncomfortable.
    But if you don't spend equal time leaning on Shopify to stop helping Nazis make money, well, that's interesting."

-   Fascism (n.): treating people the way Apple treats your music collection.

-   CS1 is not the whole of computing education.

-   We are not going to revolutionize education with blockchain.
    This shouldn't need to be said,
    but unfortunately [this post]({{site.github.url}}/2012/06/29/those-who-ignore-history.html) never gets old.

-   LaaaaaaTeeeeeeXxxxxx...

-   I could really use a guide to pronouncing accented characters in various languages.

-   `git push origin hamster` over and over again...

-   The ACM is making the last fifty years of SIGCSE proceedings freely available---for one month.

-   I almost reactivated my Twitter account to +1 [this tweet by Dave Beazley](https://twitter.com/dabeaz/status/1081268555721699329).

-   Faaaaaactoooorrrssss...

-   It has been 0 days since our last kitchen incident.

-   It's weird and uncomfortable to see DataCamp
    [using my name to advertise a course](https://twitter.com/DataCamp/status/1083800829172371457)
    seven months after firing me.

-   I still can't listen to Tracy Chapman's "Fast Car" without wanting to cry.
    And don't even talk to me about Cat Stevens' "Father and Son".

-   I sometimes choose names for files and directories so that when I do `ls`, the names in each column will be the same length.
    Then I add one thing and have to go through and rename everything after it in the alphabet to make stuff line up properly again.

-   I am starting to sag in places where I didn't even used to have saggable bits.

-   Grief and sadness are very different things.

-   Try to find something in your life that makes you feel [like Cassandra Wilson sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB1HK-rlVig).

-   "Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it's not like this compulsive need to be liked, like my need to be praised." - Michael Scott

-   Coincidence? Perhaps:
