I'm a big fan of PLOS's [Ten Simple Rules](https://collections.plos.org/ten-simple-rules)
and [Quick Tips](https://collections.plos.org/search?q=ten+quick+tips) papers.
I've contributed to [a few]({{'/10rules/' | relative_url}}),
but there are many more I'd like to read.
If you can write any of these,
I think many people would be grateful readers.
