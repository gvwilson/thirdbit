My daughter was asked to pick an ecosystem and write a paragraph about it,
then make a list of things she learned while doing the assignment.
She had exactly the same homework last year,
so after thinking for a moment about resubmitting the same work (and being told "no"),
we got this:

> The ecosystem I have chosen to study is the Moon.
> Nothing lives there,
> which makes it the simplest possible ecosystem to analyze.
> (It easier to understand a parked car with its engine off
> than a big truck hurtling down the highway with a mad clown at the steering wheel.)
> There are no producers, consumers, or decomposers on the Moon
> except maybe for whatever food or poop the astronauts left behind,
> so the nutrient cycle is about as basic as it can be.
> Climate change hasn't had an impact that we know of.
>
> What I learned:
> -   There are no whales on the Moon.
> -   There are also no trees.
> -   Which means there is also no deforestation.
> -   Or predators.
> -   Probably because there is no prey for them to eat.
> -   No native species are listed as "endangered".
> -   Yet.
