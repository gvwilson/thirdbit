title: "Bootcamps"

Some [interesting data](https://dev.to/triplebyte/bootcamps-vs-college-21cd)
about bootcamp grads versus college grads
with even-handed analysis:

> There are two ways to interpret the results in this blog post.
> One way is to say that bootcamps are window dressing.
> They teach inexperienced programers what they need to know to look like good programmers,
> but skimp on the heart of the discipline.
> However, I think this view is too cynical.
> The other way to view this post is as evidence that bootcamps focus on totally different areas than CS programs.
> They focus intensely on the practical skills required to be a productive programmer.
> These are skills that CS programs expect students to pick up around the edges of their course work.
> By being this pragmatic and giving students an intense workload, bootcamps are able to match the practical skills of CS grads.
