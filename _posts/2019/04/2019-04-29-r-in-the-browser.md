title: "R in the Browser"
---

Mozilla has just earmarked $25,000 of funding for a research project aimed at getting R running in browsers under WebAssembly.
The project is RQ5 in [this list](https://mozilla-research.forms.fm/mozilla-research-grants-2019h1/forms/6510),
and is to be conducted by someone at an academic institution or research focused non-profit.
The deadline for applications is Friday, May 31,
and they would like to spread the word as widely as possible---if you're interested or know someone who might be,
please pass it along.
