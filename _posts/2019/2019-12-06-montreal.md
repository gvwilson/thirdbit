Thirty years on,
most Canadians instantly recognize the name of their murderer.
I'd rather remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Polytechnique_massacre">theirs</a>:

- Annie Turcotte would have turned 50 this year
- Geneviève Bergeron, Anne-Marie Edward, and Michèle Richard would have been 51
- Barbara Daigneault and Anne-Marie Lemay would have been 52
- Hélène Colgan, Nathalie Croteau, Maryse Leclair, and Annie St-Arneault would have been 53
- Maryse Laganière would have been the same age as me
- Sonia Pelletier would have been 58, Maud Haviernick would have been 59, and Barbara Klucznik-Widajewicz would have been 61

Qu'elles reposent en paix.
