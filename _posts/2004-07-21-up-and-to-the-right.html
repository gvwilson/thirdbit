<p>I spent a twenty minutes this morning throwing together a couple of <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> scripts to measure <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/helium">Helium</a>'s progress over time.  The first script checks <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/helium">Helium</a> out of CVS for each day since the project started, and counts the number of lines of source and test code.  The second script takes that data and produces <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/helium#progress">this simple graph</a>.</p>

<p>I built this simple tool for three reasons. First, it's just plain cool ;-).  Second, the five students working on the project all finish at the end of August.  I know how what you <em>didn't</em> accomplish can loom large in your mind toward the end of a project, so I hoped this graph would remind them of how much they've accomplished, and how quickly.</p>

<p>Third, these little scripts are my way of finding out whether a larger tool of this kind would be worthwhile.  One half would periodically gather statistics about a project and store them in a database; the other half would extract that data and create images for display.  The whole thing could then be integrated into <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/helium">Helium</a> itself, so that students and professors could gauge projects' progress over time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sf.net">SourceForge</a> already has something like this, of course.  However, its progress meters aren't extensible: you can't create new metrics and plug 'em in.  I was sure someone would have written an open soruce framework for this, but <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> hasn't turned anything up.  I therefore have a couple of students from the <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/#study">study group</a> building a prototype. They're using <a href="http://checkstyle.sf.net">Checkstyle</a> to collect information about Java source code; eventually, we'll want to extend it so that people can use other tools, or languages, to gather data.</p>
