<a href="http://www.joeydevilla.com/2010/06/27/conflict-minerals-and-blood-tech/">Great post</a> from Joey deVilla about the hundreds of millions of dollars that flow each year from high tech companies to the ugliest warlords in the world. Don't you just wish people at the G8/G20 in Toronto (the suits <em>and</em> the scufflers) had been talking about this? And don't you just hope someone will bring it up the next time <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/steve/default.aspx">Steve</a> or <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/bios/jobs.html">Steve</a> gets up on stage?
