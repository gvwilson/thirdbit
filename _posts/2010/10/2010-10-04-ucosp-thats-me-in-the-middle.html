Andrew Louis has posted a great summary of the <a href="http://ucosp.ca/fall2010/2010/10/ucosp-code-sprint/">Fall 2010 UCOSP code sprint</a>, which took place this past weekend here in Toronto.  Over 50 students and mentors from all across the country spent two and a half days talking, coding, learning, laughing (sometimes at me), and getting to know the city and each other.  This term's projects include:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://posit.hfoss.org/">POSIT</a> (an Android app for disaster relief workers),</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://community.ingres.com/wiki/IngresGeospatial">geospatial components for INGRES</a>,</li>
	<li>a <a href="http://blog.basieproject.org/">mail relay and archive module for Pinax</a>,</li>
	<li><a href="http://fosslc.org/drupal/freeseer">Freeseer</a> (a tool for capturing video presentations),</li>
	<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/fab4browser/">fab4browser</a> (for annotating web pages),</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.reviewboard.org/">ReviewBoard</a> (an open source code review tool),</li>
	<li><a href="http://markusproject.org/">MarkUs</a> (an online grading application), and</li>
	<li>the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/db2mc/">Technology Explorer for IBM DB2</a>.</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://hyfen.net/">Andrew</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/%7Ereid/">Karen</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/%7Emcraig/">Michelle</a>, and <a href="http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/%7Estroulia/">Eleni</a> did a great job of pulling everything together, and I enjoyed meeting the two students from Waterloo who have joined the team I'm working with, but it did feel kind of weird to be a bystander instead of in the thick of things. On the plus side, it was very cool to have an <a href="http://wolever.net/">ex-student</a> explain to me (very politely) why I'm wrong to insist that unit tests must always stay off-disk.  Maybe the best way to summarize the overall goal of UCOSP is to say that we're trying to turn students into peers; here's hoping many more come back to correct me in future :-).
