Random Hacks of Kindness 2.0 is in Toronto on December 4-5, 2010, and we'd like you to take part. As <a href="http://textontechs.com/2010/10/random-hacks-of-kindness-toronto/">Heather Leson says</a>:
<blockquote><em>RHoK is a community of developers, geeks and tech-savvy do-gooders around the world, working to develop software solutions that respond to the challenges facing humanity today. RHoK is all about using technology to make the world a better place by building a community of innovation. RHoK brings software engineers together with disaster relief experts to identify critical global challenges, and develop software to respond to them. A RHoK Hackathon event brings together the best and the brightest hackers from around the world, who volunteer their time to solve real-world problems.</em></blockquote>
RHoK Toronto will run from 9:00 am on December 4, 2010 to 8:00 pm on December 5 (yes, overnight), in Rooms 2015, 2016, 2019, and 2020 of the Sidney Smith building at 100 St. George Avenue on the University of Toronto's downtown campus.  <a href="http://www.rhok.org/events/rhok-2/toronto-canada/">Registration is now open</a>: we need hackers, storytellers, software engineers, programmers, university  students, marketers, web content creators, emergency  planners,international policy and development students, teachers,  librarians, videographers, event planners, organizers, project managers, and someone who knows how to calm Miles down after his fourth cup of coffee. I know the timing isn't great for students, who will be in the middle of the death march leading up to final projects and exams, but come on, it'll be <em>fun</em>, and we'll make the world a slightly better place.
