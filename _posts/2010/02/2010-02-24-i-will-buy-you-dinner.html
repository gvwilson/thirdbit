...if you will translate the examples from Freeman and Pryce's excellent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627"><em>Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided by Tests</em></a> from Java into Python. There are already translations into <a href="http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/code.html">Ruby, Scala, C#, and Groovy</a>, and if I could find a few hours I'd tackle it myself, but I can't, so I'm offering food and drink to anyone who wants to volunteer.
