If I'm supposed to meet you today, but don't show up, I apologize: Google Calendar is "temporarily unavailable". There was no warning that I saw; disturbing that someone a continent away can disrupt my life in the same way that losing my day timer did twenty years ago. When I upgrade this WordPress installation in May, I'm going to look seriously at moving my life planning there---at least then there's a tech support team I can contact.
