I'm speaking at <a href="http://www.cis.uoguelph.ca/">Guelph University</a> on Monday, February 8, and at <a href="http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/">McMaster University</a> on Wednesday, February 10. Both talks will be based on my <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/gvwilson/bits-of-evidence-2338367">DevDays/CUSEC talk</a> about <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/category/ebse">evidence-based software engineering</a>. I look forward to meeting lots of you! (I'm also speaking on Saturday February 20 at <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/schedule/">PyCon</a> in Atlanta; looking forward to meeting lots of people there, too.)
