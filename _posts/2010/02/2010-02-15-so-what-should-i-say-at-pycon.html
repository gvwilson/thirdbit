I'm speaking at <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2010/about/">PyCon</a> on Saturday. The blurb I sent in says:
<blockquote><strong><em>What We've Learned From Building Basie</em></strong>

Since September 2008, teams of undergraduates from half a dozen different universities have been building a Django-based replacement for Trac called Basie. This talk will present what they've accomplished and discuss what we've learned about getting junior developers who are juggling half a dozen projects at once to build production-quality code.</blockquote>
I'd enjoy hearing from past and present project students---49ers, GSoC alumni, and everyone else, not just those who worked on Basie---about what they got out of the various project courses I have run, and why.
