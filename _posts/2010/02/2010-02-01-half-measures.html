Lots of people were chatting last week about <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/uid/sikuli/">Sikuli</a>, the "programming with screenshots" project from MIT. Even if I didn't agree with <a href="http://adam.goucher.ca/?p=1369">Adam Goucher's comments</a> (with I do), I'd still criticize it as a half-measure: a real <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~gvwilson/articles/extprog-acmqueue-2004.pdf">extensible programming system</a> would allow one programmer to nest this capability in a generic programming language.
