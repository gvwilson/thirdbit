Dear Lazyweb,

Is there a tool somewhere that will automatically generate and validate all possible output variations for a <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> HTML template page? We're using Django in <a href="http://basieproject.org">Basie</a>, and have been running into problems when one branch of a conditional closes a tag, but the other doesn't:
<pre>&lt;li&gt;opening text
{% if something %}
blah blah
&lt;/li&gt;
{% else %}
Whoops, forgot to close the list element.
{% endif %}</pre>
I know that code review should catch these, but when the examples are longer, it's hard to keep track of as-yet unclosed tags. Testing should catch them too, but sometimes people forget to write as many test as they should *cough* *cough*. So, is there something that will parse the HTML templates, generate all possible variations, and check that they're valid? It wouldn't have to generate all possible cross-products (at least, I don't think it would), so runtime would be manageable.

Thanks in advance.
