My side of the conversation this morning went like this. (I would have recorded it "for quality assurance purposes", but where would I send the recording?)
<ul>
	<li>I'd like to have a technician come in to move a cable connection.</li>
	<li>Yes, I understand there will be a charge.</li>
	<li>A <em>monthly</em> charge?  Why will there be a monthly charge?</li>
	<li>No, I don't want to add a connection, I want to move an existing one.</li>
	<li>No, I want to disable the one that's there, and put in a new one.</li>
	<li>What do you mean, you can't disable one?</li>
	<li>Yes, I want to TURN OFF the one that's there, and---</li>
	<li>No, I don't want to cancel my service.</li>
	<li>Yes, I want to---may I finish please?</li>
	<li>Thank you.  I want to move the existing connection in the living room to a different place in the living room.</li>
	<li>Right, so the number of connections stays the same.</li>
	<li>Right, but we're adding one, so if we turn one off and add one, the monthly charge should stay the same, shouldn't it?</li>
	<li>Yes, adding one, but we're turning one off, so ---</li>
	<li>No, we're not canceling the service. We are just moving an outlet from one place in the room to another place in the same room.</li>
	<li>No, we're not moving house, we're moving the cable outlet.</li>
	<li>So we can put the TV in a different place.</li>
	<li>Yes, in the same room.</li>
	<li>Yes, I understand there will be a charge for the service.  But it will be a one-time service charge, right?</li>
	<li>No, I --- ma'am, I didn't ask what our current service charges are, I just want to confirm that there's just a one-time service charge for moving the cable outlet.</li>
	<li>OK, if you can just send the technician, I'll explain it to them.</li>
</ul>
