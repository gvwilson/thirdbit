<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Last-Chance-See-Douglas-Adams/dp/0345371984"><em>Last Chance to See</em></a> (the best book he ever wrote), Douglas Adams wondered what the world "looks" like to rhinos. Their nasal membranes are larger than their brains, but they have terrible eyesight. As a result, they would see Douglas like a poorly-rendered sprite on a low-res computer screen, but could smell him on the wind half a mile away. Sight is effectively instantaneous, but smell isn't. Douglas's insight was to realize that as a result a rhino's view of the world is rich with the data of things past---for them, the past and the present blur together in one sensorium.</p>
<p>I was reminded of Adams' thinking as I watched people use Twitter and other social media at <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2010/">PyCon</a>. Everyone's perception was smeared in time and space: sitting in one talk, they could catch a whiff of what was going on three rooms away by keeping one eye on tweets from its audience, and someone who had just come into a room could recap the discussion by scrolling through the last two pages of other people's comments. "This and now" has become "these and recently". I wonder if that's why my generation finds it all so confusing: we're looking for things when we should be taking a deep breath to find what's on the wind.</p>
