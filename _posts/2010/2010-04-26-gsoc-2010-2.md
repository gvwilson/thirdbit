This year's <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/program/list_projects/google/gsoc2010">Google Summer of Code students and projects</a> have been posted—congratulations to them all. The list unfortunately doesn't specify which open source organizations the projects are with, or what schools the students are from, but we've had a few successes:
<ul>
  <li>Mike Conley (University of Toronto, Canada): finishing off ReviewBoard's extensions framework</li>
  <li>Chas Leichner (University of Arizona, USA): a "guided replay" extension for IDLE (I'm mentoring this one)</li>
  <li>Ian Lienert (University of Toronto, Canada): a naive Bayes algorithm for classifying email in Thunderbird</li>
  <li>Lori Lee (University of Toronto, Canada): phpMyAdmin UI cleanup</li>
  <li>Christian Muise (University of Toronto, Canada): supercharging SymPy with assumptions and logic</li>
  <li>Kevin Salvesen (currently University of Toronto, but heading home to Sweden): improving the reStructured Text WYSIWYG editor</li>
  <li>Sarah Strong (University of Toronto, Canada): making the clipboard work like it's supposed to</li>
  <li>Felipe Vieira (Federal University of Campina Grande, Brazil): RSS feeds for FreeSeer</li>
</ul>
My apologies to anyone I missed, and best of luck to everyone involved.
