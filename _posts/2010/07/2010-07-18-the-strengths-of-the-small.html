<a href="http://catenary.wordpress.com/">Jorge Aranda</a>, who recently completed his PhD in Computer Science at the University of Toronto, and who contributed a chapter to <a href="/blog/archives/category/ebse"><em>Making Software</em></a>, recently wrote a position paper on <a href="http://catenary.wordpress.com/2010/07/14/the-strengths-of-small-software-organizations/">the strengths of small software companies</a> that's based in large part on his thesis work. It's quite good---please pester him to post the screencast he prepared as a backup for his remote presentation.
