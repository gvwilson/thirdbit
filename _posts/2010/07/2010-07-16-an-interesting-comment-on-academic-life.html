Beryl Lieff Benderly: "<a href="http://www.miller-mccune.com/science/the-real-science-gap-16191/">The Real Science Gap</a>". The teaser says, <em><em>"It's not insufficient schooling or a shortage of scientists. It's a  lack of job opportunities. Americans need the reasonable hope that  spending their youth preparing to do science will provide a satisfactory  career."</em></em> And later: <em>"Because of long-ignored internal contradictions, however, the American  research enterprise has become so severely dysfunctional that it  actively prevents the great majority of the young Americans aspiring to  do research from realizing their dreams."</em>
