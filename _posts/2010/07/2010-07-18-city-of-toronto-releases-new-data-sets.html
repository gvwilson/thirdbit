Longtime readers will recall that I ran an open government/open data course at the <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a> last fall. I wasn't able to stay as involved as I would have liked [1], but I'm heartened to see that the City of Toronto has released some more data sets --- see <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/open/catalogue.htm">toronto.ca/open</a>'s catalog page for details. Happy hacking!

[1] I couldn't find a professor willing to run the course again after my departure from U of T, and having spread myself too thin for too long, didn't think I could keep it going and do a proper job on <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/blog/">Software Carpentry</a> as well. Middle age is when you stop asking what is possible, and start asking what possibilities remain...
