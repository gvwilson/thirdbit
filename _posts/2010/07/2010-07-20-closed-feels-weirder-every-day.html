By now, most readers of this blog will have heard about Google's <a href="http://appinventor.googlelabs.com/about/">App Inventor</a> for Android, a building-blocks programming system based on MIT's <a href="http://education.mit.edu/drupal/openblocks">OpenBlocks</a> that's intended to let gazillions of people who aren't programmers build the apps they want themselves. What most people probably don't know is that <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/appinventor/browse_thread/thread/a30a2b4dbc1b4708/e3d03544c3ed579a?lnk=gst&amp;q=license&amp;pli=1">App Inventor is closed source</a>: according to Google's Sharon Perl, Google's modifications to OpenBlocks "...are not currently available as open source."

My reaction when I read this was, "Huh? That's dumb." App Inventor would be a great starting point for any number of student projects---it cries out to be hacked, ported, and extended.  (If it was a <a href="http://ucosp.ca">UCOSP</a> project this fall, I bet it would be most students' first choice.)  I'd be very interested in finding out why Google decided to lock it down...
