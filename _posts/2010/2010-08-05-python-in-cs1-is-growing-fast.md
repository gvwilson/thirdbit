From <a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2010/08/05/growth-of-python-in-cs1/">Mark Guzdial's ever-informative blog</a>:
<blockquote>I just got a report...on the state of  the Python CS1 market.  The market size is estimated to be about 20,300  students per year, up 45% since last year.  The market has had around  40% gains for each of the last three years.</blockquote>
Yay! But I wonder what they count as "the market", and how big the absolute share (as opposed to growth) is... Anyone know?
