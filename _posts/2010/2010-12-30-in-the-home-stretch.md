A quick update on <em>The Architecture of Open Source Applications</em>—we have chapters in one state or another, or firm promises, for:
<ol>
	<li>Asterisk</li>
	<li>Audacity</li>
	<li>Bash</li>
	<li>Battle for Wesnoth</li>
	<li>Berkeley DB</li>
	<li>CMake</li>
	<li>Continuous Integration (survey)</li>
	<li>Drupal</li>
	<li>Eclipse</li>
	<li>Erlang</li>
	<li>Graphite</li>
	<li>Jitsi (formerly SIP Communicator)</li>
	<li>LLVM</li>
	<li>Mercurial</li>
	<li>NoSQL (survey)</li>
	<li>Packaging (survey)</li>
	<li>Selenium</li>
	<li>Sendmail</li>

	<li>Thousand Parsec</li>

</ol>
and I'm hoping that a few of the stragglers will pull something off as well. We've been sent everything from TROFF and LaTeX through HTML, DocBook, and POD to Microsoft Word and OpenOffice, and some of the diagrams were in formats whose names I had to look up, but it's aaaall coming together. I'll post again when it goes to production and we have a firm publication date.
