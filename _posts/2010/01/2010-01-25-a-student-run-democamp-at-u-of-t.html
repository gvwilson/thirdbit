Via Reginald Tan and others, news of <a href="https://csc.cdf.toronto.edu/bb/YaBB.pl?num=1264433059">a student-oriented DemoCamp event at the University of Toronto</a>. Hope to see lots of students demoing; hope to see lots of people from industry there asking questions and passing out business cards :-)
