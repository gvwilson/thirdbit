This happens all the time, and irks me more with each passing year: PostRank has several categorized lists of "<a href="https://analytics.postrank.com/2009/badges/influence">best blogs</a>", as judged by popularity, influence, and what-not. Problem is, their categorization doesn't include "computer science" as a science: there's agriculture, anthropology, and so on down to urban planning, but not computer science. CS doesn't show up under "Technology", either: that covers things from "Agile" through "Photoshop" to "UX", but not the theoretical or research aspects of computing. Undergrad enrolment in CS looks like it's finally starting to climb again, after six or seven years in the basement, but if we ever want to break the boom-and-bust cycle, we need people (particularly high school students and teachers) to understand that computer <em>is</em> science.
