Three of my grad students---<a href="http://littlecomputerscientist.wordpress.com/">Aran Donohue</a>, <a href="http://www.jaysnothere.com/blog/">Jason Montojo</a>, and <a href="http://rorytulk.blogspot.com/">Rory Tulk</a>---are wrapping up their MSc's this month. Coincidentally (OK, not really, the academic calendar being what it is), my other two students are converging on research topics. <a href="http://mikeconley.ca/blog/">Mike Conley</a> has got the code review bug in a big way, and wants to look at how we can teach students to review code, and whether doing that will have an impact on how (and how well) they program. <a href="http://zuzelvp47uoft.wordpress.com/">Zuzel Vera Pacheco</a> is going to look at ways of annotating or animating visual representations of databases, such as entity-relationship diagrams, in order to help developers understand system architecture, debug things, and gauge the likely impact of changes. If you're interested in either topic, I'm sure they'd enjoy hearing from you.
