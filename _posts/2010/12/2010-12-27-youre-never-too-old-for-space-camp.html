I can't remember how I stumbled across <a href="http://buythissatellite.org">BuyThisSatellite.org</a>, but I'm glad I did. I've been a science fiction fan for (literally) as long as I can remember, and while I doubt I'll ever make orbit myself, there's something gosh-darned cool about actually buying a chunk of an actual orbiting satellite. Their web site says it best:
<ul>
	<li>The owner of the world's most capable communication satellite just went bankrupt.</li>
	<li>We're fundraising to buy it.</li>
	<li>So we can move it.</li>
	<li>To connect millions of people who will turn access into opportunity.</li>
</ul>
Please help---after all, how many things do you know that can bring BoingBoing, Al Jazeera, and Popular Science together?
