It's a shame people only get meaningful academic credit for creating new knowledge (regardless of its importance), and not for explaining existing knowledge better than anyone has before. For example, have a look at Neil Brown's "<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/411845/">Ghost</a> <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/412131/">of</a> <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/414618/">Unix</a> <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/416494/">Past</a>" series, or almost anything from the <a href="http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/">SysAdvent</a> blog (such as Adam Fletcher's look at <a href="http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2010/12/day-15-down-ls-rabbit-hole.html">what really happens</a> when you run 'ls'). If things like this were counted toward promotion and tenure, I think there'd be a lot more of them, but how to count is a hard problem. As Titus Brown recently posted on his blog:
<blockquote><em>This is the problem with the online world for scientists: there's no real systematized incentive to any of this online stuff.  And that makes it really tough.  I'm going through Reappointment right now...Nowhere on there is there a place for "influential blog posts"---how would you measure that, anyway?</em></blockquote>
