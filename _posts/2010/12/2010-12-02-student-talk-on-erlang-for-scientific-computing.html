Qiyu Zhu and Colin Morris will give at talk at noon on December 8, 2010, at the SciNet Users Group meeting titled "Fault Tolerant Scientific Computing with Erlang".  Qiyu and Colin have been implementing the Cowichan Problems, a set of model problems similar to numerical HPC "kernels", in Erlang, a language designed to support distributed, fault-tolerant, soft-real-time, non-stop applications. In this talk, they will give a brief introduction to Erlang, and discuss their experiences implementing two different parallel programming paradigms in it.  The talk will take place at SciNet Headquarters, 256 McCaul St., Rm 235.
