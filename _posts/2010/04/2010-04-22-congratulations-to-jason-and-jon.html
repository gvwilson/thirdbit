Congratulations to <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~jmontojo/">Jason Montojo</a> and <a href="http://skoolr.blogspot.com/">Jon Pipitone</a>, who have just completed their Master's degrees in Computer Science at the University of Toronto. Jon was one of my very first CSC49X students in September 2002, and Jason was in the second batch in January 2003. I'm proud to have worked with them, and wish them all the best.

And in other school news, Alecia Fowler is still <a href="http://ajfowler.wordpress.com/2010/04/21/call-for-participants/">looking for people</a> to participate  in her web-based study of how people understand maps. If you have a few minutes, and would like to help her help the visually disadvantaged, please send her an email at <a title="accessiblemapping@gmail.com" href="mailto:accessiblmapping@gmail.com">accessiblemapping@gmail.com</a>.

(And in <em>other</em> school news, I handed in my final set of marks two days ago. Yee hah!)
