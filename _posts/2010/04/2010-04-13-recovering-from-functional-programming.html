James Hague has an interesting series of posts about functional programming, the latest of which, "<a href="http://prog21.dadgum.com/54.html">Functional Programming Doesn't Work (and what to do about it)</a>" starts with:
<blockquote>Read suddenly and in isolation, this may be easy to misinterpret, so I  suggest first reading some past articles which have led to this point.</blockquote>
I agree with his thesis: eliminating mutable state, side effects, and/or global variables doesn't always make programs cleaner. I'll know that we have a working theory of program complexity (as opposed to algorithmic complexity) when such recommendations can be prescriptive.
