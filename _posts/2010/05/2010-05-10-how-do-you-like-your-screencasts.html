Over on the <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/blog/">Software Carpentry blog</a>, I've posted links to <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2010/05/first-preliminary-alpha-test-etc-screencast/">three</a> <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2010/05/day-5-a-different-kind-of-screencast/">trial</a> <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2010/05/day-6-screencast-with-point-form-notes/">screencasts</a>. We'd be grateful for your comments: do you like the format? Is the video quality good enough?  Are the transcript and/or notes useful?  Other than adding exercises (which we're going to try tomorrow and Wednesday), what could we do to make them better?

And while we're on the subject, what are you favorite technical/training videos? Do you like the PowerPoint slides with inset talking heads of Google Tech Talks?  Or do you prefer screen recordings with voiceover, like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWHO4lJlX54">this</a>?  How about <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/rss_plain_english">Common Craft</a>'s mix of cartoons and stop-motion film?
