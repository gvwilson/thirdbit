In a discussion with <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~reid">Karen Reid</a> yesterday about what should be in U of T's second-year CS hardware course, I learned something about my own beliefs that I hadn't realized before: I believe that in order to be a computer scientist, a person <em>must</em> know (or must once have known) how logic gates, cleverly combined, can do things like add numbers. I don't know if it's a holdover from my degree in engineering, or whether it's a ghostly memory of the epiphany I had in Prof. Michael Levison's CS210 class at <a href="http://www.cs.queensu.ca">Queen's</a> in 1981-82 when I suddenly understood how deterministic collections of circuits could make choices (i.e., execute 'if' statements). I doubt we'll ever agree on a definition of what computer science is, but this, the idea that programs are data, trees &amp; recursion, and how garbage-collected object-oriented languages actually work are all marked "must know" in my mind. What's in that category in yours?
