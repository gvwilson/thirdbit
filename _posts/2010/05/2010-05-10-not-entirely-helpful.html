As a follow-up to the <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/3834.html">previous post</a>, we'd like to evaluate the usability of our screencasts systematically. We know we're not the first (or ten-thousandth) people to want to do this, so I went looking for procedures we could borrow. The University of Maryland's <a href="http://lap.umd.edu/quis/">Questionnaire for User Interface Satisfaction</a> (QUIS) looks like just what we need:
<blockquote>(QUIS) is a tool developed by a multi-disciplinary team of researchers  in the Human-Computer Interaction Lab (HCIL) at the University of  Maryland at College Park. [It] was designed to assess users'  subjective satisfaction with specific aspects of the human-computer  interface. The QUIS team successfully addressed the reliability and  validity problems found in other satisfaction measures, creating a  measure that is highly reliable across many types of interfaces.</blockquote>
Excellent! Until you click on the Licensing link, and discover that the questionnaire is $750 for commercial users and $200 for academics. *sigh*
