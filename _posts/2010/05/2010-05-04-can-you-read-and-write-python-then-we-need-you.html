Mike Conley, another of my current grad students, has got <em></em>ethics approval for <em>his</em> research study <a href="/blog/archives/3815.html">as well</a>. From <a href="http://mikeconley.ca/blog/2010/05/04/ladies-and-gentlemen-step-right-up/">his blog post</a>:
<blockquote>Want to win a $100 Best Buy gift card? Are you an undergraduate computer science student who knows Python? If so, I need you!

Subjects are needed to take part in a study concerning peer evaluation and grading. Participants will be asked to complete small, fun programming exercises, and peer grade other submissions. Time needed for the study is approximately 1.5hrs and takes place in person in the Bahen Center at the University of Toronto.

Subjects should be undergraduate computer science students with programming experience in Python.

Participants will be entered into a draw for a $100 Best Buy gift card.

Please help him out if you can---I think we'll all learn some cool stuff from his study.
