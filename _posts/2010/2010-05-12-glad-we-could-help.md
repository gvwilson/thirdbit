I got email yesterday from Sylvain Thénault, one of the <a href="http://www.logilab.org/857">PyLint</a> developers:
<blockquote>I would like to thank you and the team for your contribution to the pylint project! Your students have actually contributed some useful stuff which have been included in pylint. I can't tell that from all students I had working on my projects... If you have another students team next year, I'll be happy to work with them ;)</blockquote>
I'm glad we could help; I know the students who worked on the project learned a lot about code analysis and open source development practices.
