You wouldn't know it from this blog, but I actually do still read books. In particular, I just finished Terrence Ryan's <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/trevan/driving-technical-change"><em>Driving Technical Change: Why People On Your Team Don't Act on Good Ideas, and How To Convince Them They Should</em></a>. (Full disclosure: I've done two books with its publisher, Pragmatic, and am editing a third right now.)  Ryan divides skeptics into the uninformed, the herd, the cynics, the burned, the time-crunched, the boss, and the irrational, then introduces several persuasion strategies and explores how they'll work with each group.  It isn't rocket science, but it <em>is</em> well organized, hype-free, and useful. Recommended.
