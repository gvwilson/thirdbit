It might feel like winter is over, but a lot of people still need your help. Over on Streetknit, there's word of another knitup called <a href="http://www.streetknit.ca/?p=86">Wise Daughters</a>, which will take place on the last Tuesday of every month. Yarn is provided if you don't have a project on the go, but bring your  own needles if possible.
