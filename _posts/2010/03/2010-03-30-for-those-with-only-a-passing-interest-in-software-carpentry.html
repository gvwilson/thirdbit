Now that <a href="http://softwarecarpentry.wordpress.com/2010/03/25/software-carpentry-version-4-is-a-go/">Software Carpentry Version 4</a> is a go, I've moved most blogging about scientific software development over to <a href="http://softwarecarpentry.wordpress.com">http://softwarecarpentry.wordpress.com</a>. Recent highlights include:
<ol>
	<li>You can now follow Software Carpentry's progress on Twitter as @swcarpentry.</li>
	<li>I'm helping teach a course on <a href="http://softwarecarpentry.wordpress.com/2010/03/25/summer-course-analyzing-next-generation-sequencing-data/">analyzing next-generation sequencing data</a> at Michigan State University at the end of May.</li>
	<li>Some thoughts on <a href="http://softwarecarpentry.wordpress.com/2010/03/26/online-delivery/">online course delivery</a>.</li>
	<li>Some more thoughts on <a href="http://softwarecarpentry.wordpress.com/2010/03/26/instructional-design/">instructional design</a>. (These two posts are mostly actually pleas for help.)</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://softwarecarpentry.wordpress.com/2010/03/28/recommended-reading/">announcement</a> that the <a href="http://softwarecarpentry.wordpress.com/reading/">course bibliography</a> is online.</li>
	<li>A discussion of <a href="http://softwarecarpentry.wordpress.com/2010/03/29/whats-not-on-the-reading-list/">what's missing from that bibliography</a>.</li>
	<li>My analysis of <a href="http://softwarecarpentry.wordpress.com/2010/03/30/formats/">the pros and cons of various formats</a> for the course material. Much to my own surprise, LaTeX is the frontrunner...</li>
