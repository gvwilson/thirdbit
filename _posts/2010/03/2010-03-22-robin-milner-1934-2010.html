We are sorry to announce that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Milner">Robin Milner</a> died on Saturday 20th March,  in Cambridge, just three days after the funeral of his wife, Lucy.

He will be greatly missed by his family and friends, as well as the  academic community.

We are expecting there to be a symposium in due course to provide an  opportunity for Robin's many academic colleagues to celebrate him and  his work.

From Chloë and Barney Milner

He was one of the nicest men I ever met...
