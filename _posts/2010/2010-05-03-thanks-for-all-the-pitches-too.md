The first thing my <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">former students</span> friends gave me at my going-away party last week was an envelope full of random phrases. I was apparently supposed to entertain them with elevator pitch karaoke, but hey, there was cake 'n' balloons—who can focus when there's cake 'n' balloons? Anyway, for the record, here's what was in the envelope:
<ul>
  <li>sea monkey farms for world domination</li>
  <li>amphibians trounce mammals</li>
  <li>Timbits</li>
  <li>maximize the beer bottle coaster efficiency of copies of <em>Beautiful Code</em></li>
  <li>hippo mortality rates</li>
  <li>the moon</li>
  <li>teaching elevator pitches</li>
</ul>
Next time, folks—I promise, next time I'll do it.
