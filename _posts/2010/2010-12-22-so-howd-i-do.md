Back in November 9 I laid out my goals for the remainder of the year. Let's see how I did:
<ol>
  <li>Time with family: yes.</li>
  <li>Help Mike and Zuzel finish their theses: mostly. Mike's is done, Zuzel's is close.</li>
  <li>The gym: epic fail.</li>
  <li>Three more lectures for Software Carpentry: only got two done. Funding: haven't started (worrying fail).</li>
  <li>Revitalize online run of the course: didn't happen. Organize next term's: 78 have filled in registration so far.</li>
  <li>Wrap up my dad's book: check.</li>
  <li>Publicize <em>Making Software</em>: I've done what I can (including last week's webinar).</li>
  <li>Start editing <em>The Architecture of Open Source Applications</em>: check, though chapters are still coming in.</li>
  <li>Finish one of the children's books I've got on the go: complete fail.</li>
  <li>Wrap up the undergrad projects I'm supervising: check</li>
</ol>
Total: 8/14 (since some bullets are actually several things). Here's hoping for a higher score in 2011...
