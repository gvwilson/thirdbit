Another good post from Mark Guzdial, this one reporting on a CS education conference he's attending. Among the talks was one summarizing seven non-myths about computing, i.e., things that people sometimes claim are myths, but which are actually true:
<ol>
	<li>Programming is boring.</li>
	<li>You have to sit in front of a computer all day.</li>
	<li>You have to work long hours.</li>
	<li>Programming is asocial.</li>
	<li>Programming is for those who think logically.</li>
	<li>Software is being outsourced.</li>
	<li>Programming is a well-paid profession.</li>
</ol>
