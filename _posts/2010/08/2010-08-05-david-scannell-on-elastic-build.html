David Scannell, an ex-student of mine who is now at <a href="http://gridcentriclabs.com/">GridCentric</a>, has posted an interesting article on <a href="http://blog.gridcentriclabs.com/2010/07/elastic-build-systems.html">using elastic clouds for continuous integration</a>. Lots of ideas here I only vaguely knew --- worth checking out.
