I'm a big fan of Jon Udell's work; here are two recent examples to convince you that you should be too:
<ol>
	<li>His "<a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4532.html">Architectures of Context</a>" presentation.</li>
	<li>The start of a series of posts on "<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/08/lessons-learned-building-the-e.html">Lessons Learned Building Elmcity</a>" (which does for calendar data what blogging and aggregators does for news).</li>
</ol>
