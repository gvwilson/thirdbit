Zuzel Vera Pacheco is studying how developers visualize SQL queries for her Master's thesis project. She ran her last subject a few days ago, and yesterday <a href="http://zuzelvp47uoft.wordpress.com/2010/06/23/random-draw/">did the draw</a> for the gift card she was using as an incentive. There's still a lot to be done—coding and analyzing all that data is going to take a month or more—but I'm really pleased that she is making such rapid progress.
