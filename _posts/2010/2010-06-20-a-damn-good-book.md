I'm partway through Bill Karwin's new book <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/bksqla/sql-antipatterns"><em>SQL Antipatterns</em></a> [1] and all I can say is, "Damn, this is good." Important material, crisp writing, well-chosen examples---it's exactly what a technical book should be, and I hope a lot of people read it.

[1] Fair disclosure: I've done <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/gwd/data-crunching">two</a> <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/gwpy/practical-programming">books</a> with Pragmatic, and am working on a third.
