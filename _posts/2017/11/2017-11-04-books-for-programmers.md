title: "Books for Programmers"

I used to review books about programming for *Doctor Dobb's Journal*.
Over the last decade,
though,
I have belatedly realized that programmers can't understand what they ought to build
without reading other things as well.
The books below have helped me understand
just how intellectually impoverished Silicon Valley's worldview is;
if you find them useful,
I'd appreciate suggestions for additions.

1. Karen Armstrong: *[The Great Transformation][great-transformation]*.
   Chronicles the critical centuries in which Confucianism and Daoism arose in China,
   Hinduism and Buddhism in India,
   monotheism in the Middle East,
   and rationalism in Greece.

1. Jean Baker: *[Sisters: The Lives of America's Suffragists][sisters]*.
   Explains history through biography,
   and does well at both.

1. Stewart Brand: *[How Buildings Learn][hbl]*.
   One of the most practical thinkers of the 20th Century draws on his experience as an architect
   to explain how many other things in our society come to be as they are.

1. Stephen Brookfield and Stephen Preskill: *[The Discussion Book][discussion]*.
   Describes fifty different ways that groups can discuss things and reach decisions,
   most of which I had never seen before.

1. Alex Butterworth: *[The World That Never Was][anarchists]*.
   Explores the early days of the anarchist movement,
   and in doing so shows how governments create the villains they need.

1. Tressie McMillan Cottom: *[Lower Ed][lower-ed]*.
   Its subtitle is "the troubling rise of for-profit colleges in the new economy",
   and there's a lot in here that people pushing online education should think about.

1. Matthew Crawford: *[Shop Class as Soulcraft][shop-class]*.
   There are truths about ourselves we can only learn
   by interacting with things that cannot be swayed or bargained with.

1. Edzard Ernst and Simon Singh: *[Trick or Treatment][trick-treatment]*.
   A sceptical (but not hostile) look at alternative medicine
   that is incidentally a great primer on standards of evidence
   and how to interpret scientific findings.

1. Peter Frase: *[Four Futures][four-futures]*.
   Explores four scenarios in which our reactions to increasing automation and worsening climate change
   play out.

1. Elizabeth Green: *[Building a Better Teacher][babt]*.
   Shows that educational reforms over the last fifty years have failed
   because they've been tackling the wrong problems.

1. Adam Hochschild: *[Bury the Chains][chains]*.
   "Slavery was to the nineteenth century what oil is today:
   morally repugnant but economically indispensible."

1. Jennifer Hecht: *[Doubt: A History][doubt]*.
   Traces the evolution of one of the great traditions in Western thought
   (one which even today makes many people uncomfortable).

1. Tracy Kidder: *[The Soul of a New Machine][soul-machine]*.
   The best book ever written about computing's Silver Age.

1. Andro Linklater: *[Owning the Land][owning-land]*.
   The idea that individuals can own land is a lot younger than most people realize,
   and its emergence holds a lot of lessons for today's debates over intellectual property.

1. Jane Margolis and Allan Fisher: *[Unlocking the Clubhouse][clubhouse]*.
   A slim, essential, evidence-based look at why the gender imbalance in computing is so skewed
   and what can be done about it.

1. Samuel Moyn: *[The Last Utopia][last-utopia]*.
   Argues that human rights became the defining issue for post-war progressives
   only because others failed.

1. George Orwell: *[Essays][orwell]*.
   The best writing from the best political writer (in English) of the 20th Century.

1. Pankaj Mishra: *[From the Ruins of Empire][empire]*.
   Three intellectual biographies showing how the peoples of Asia have responded to the West.

1. Charles Petzold: *[The Annotated Turing][annotated-turing]*.
   A line-by-line exegesis of Turing's most famous paper,
   full of illuminating insights into the Golden Age of computing.

1. Jim Stanford: *[Economics for Everyone][economics-everyone]*.
   A useful antidote to the abstract, unquestioning way that neoliberal economics is usually presented.

1. Ellen Ullman: *[Life in Code][life-code]*.
   The second volume in the author's personal history of computing's Bronze Age.

1. Jonathan Weiner: *[Time, Love, Memory][tlm]*.
   A great description of how science is actually done,
   and of what it's like to have a life in science.

1. Susan Whitfield: *[Life Along the Silk Road][silk-road]*.
   A history of Central Asia told in twelve biographies.

1. Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett: *[The Spirit Level][spirit-level]*.
   An evidence-based exploration of how and why greater equality is better for everyone.

And since we're here:
I've written [several wishlists of books that don't exist][not-on-the-shelves].
I'll probably do an update next year,
but meanwhile,
I'd be grateful for:

- A history of the idea of intellectual property similar to *[Owning the Land][owning-land]*.

- Another book of this kind on the history of privacy.

- Something that presents the ideas in James Scott's *[Seeing Like a State][seeing-like-state]*
  in less academic form.

- A shorter version of Elinor Ostrom's *[Governing the Commons][governing-commons]*
  (David Bollier's *[Think Like a Commoner][think-like-commoner]* is good,
  but isn't quite what I'm after).
