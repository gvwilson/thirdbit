I have made updates to _[How to Teach Programming (and Other Things)]({{site.github.url}}/teaching/)_,
and would be grateful for feedback.
New chapters are marked with &#x2605; in the table of contents,
and chapters with changes marked with &#x2606;.
The changes themselves are in <span class="changed">this color</span>,
and you can send comments and corrections to [gvwilson@third-bit.com](mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com).
Thanks very much.
