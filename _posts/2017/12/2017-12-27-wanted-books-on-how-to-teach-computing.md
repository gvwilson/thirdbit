Hundreds of books have been written about how to teach mathematics.
So far as I know,
only a handful have been written about how to teach computing.
I'd be grateful for additions to this list:

* Guzdial: *[Learner-Centered Design of Computing Education](https://www.amazon.com/Learner-Centered-Design-Computing-Education-Human-centered/dp/1627053514/)* (2015).
* Hazzan, Lapidot, & Ragonis: *[Guide to Teaching Computer Science](https://www.amazon.com/Guide-Teaching-Computer-Science-Activity-Based/dp/1447166299/)* (2015).
* Krauss & Prottsman: *[Computational Thinking and Coding for Every Student](https://www.amazon.com/Computational-Thinking-Coding-Every-Student/dp/1506341284/)* (2016).
* Morris, Uppal, & Wells: *[Teaching Computational Thinking and Coding in Primary Schools](https://www.amazon.com/Teaching-Computational-Thinking-Primary-Transforming/dp/1473985056/)* (2017).
* Rich & Hodges (ed): *[Emerging Research, Practice, and Policy on Computational Thinking](https://www.amazon.com/Emerging-Computational-Educational-Communications-Technology/dp/3319526901/)* (2017).
* Umaschi Bers: *[Coding as a Playground](https://www.amazon.com/Coding-Playground-Programming-Computational-Childhood/dp/1138225622/)* (2017).
* Williams: *[No Fear Coding](https://www.amazon.com/No-Fear-Coding-Computational-Curriculum/dp/1564843874/)* (2017).

*Clarification: while I'm always interested in good book that teach computing, this list is meant to be books about how to do that.*
