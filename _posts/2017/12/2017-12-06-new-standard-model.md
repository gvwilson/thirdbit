It's been 35 years since I first wrote a program for someone else to use.
A lot of things have changed:

| What          | Then                              | Now            |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Documents     | nroff                             | Markdown       |
| Data          | lines of text/regular expressions | JSON           |
| Visualization | What's visualization?             | SVG            |
| Glue          | Pipes                             | HTTP           |
| Code          | C                                 | JavaScript     |
| Testing       | Um...                             | xUnit/CI       |
| Sharing       | Tar files                         | HTTP           |
| Answers       | man pages and Usenet              | Stack Overflow |

A lot of things have stayed the same, though.
For example,
there isn't a row for "editing"
because most programmers don't do anything with their fancy IDEs
that I didn't do with Vi in 1982,
even though those IDEs ship with tools that I would have considered magical.

So:
what am I missing?
Back then we used ASCII;
today we (kind of) use Unicode,
but I don't think that's as fundamental a change
as the shift from mailing TAR files to sending HTTP requests.
What else *is* big enough to belong on this list?
