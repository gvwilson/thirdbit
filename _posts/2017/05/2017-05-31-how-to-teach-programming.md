> A new edition of this book is now available at <http://teachtogether.tech>,
> and printed copies can be purchased at <http://www.lulu.com/shop/greg-wilson/teaching-tech-together/paperback/product-23720755.html>.

Over the past few months,
I've been running a one-day introduction to teaching based on the Carpentries' instructor training course
for grassroots get-into-coding organizations in Toronto focused on a variety of under-represented groups.
Some of the people involved have asked for a printed copy of the material,
so I have cut down the training materials as they were in January to make a short booklet.
It is now available at cost from the link above
(or rather as close to "at cost" as Lulu will allow–it insists that I make a profit of $0.02 per copy,
which I will use to buy stickers every once in a while).
If you find it useful,
please give me a shout:
I'd welcome a chance to compare notes.
