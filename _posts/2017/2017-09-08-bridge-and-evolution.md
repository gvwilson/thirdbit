I hate the phrase "thought leader".
It's the epitome of self-congratulatory business-speak,
meant to sound vaguely inspirational without providing any affordance for disagreement.
On those rare occasions when someone accuses me of being one,
I tell them (quite truthfully) that I'm more of a thought scavenger.
But a discussion last night
at an inspiring meetup hosted by [DITTo](https://www.meetup.com/DITTO-Diversity-Inclusion-Talks-TO/)
and [Rangle](http://rangle.io)
for the [Bridge](http://bridgeschool.io/) program
made me realize that "scavenger" isn't the most accurate analogy.

When I was young,
and most of what I knew about genetics came from reading *X-Men* comics,
I thought that mutation was the driving force of evolution.
I later learned that recombination is actually much more important.
Viable new genes do occasionally emerge,
but adaptation is usually a matter of remixing what's already there.

The same is true of ideas and organizations.
Nothing in [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) was genuinely novel;
what *was* new was the particular combination of
some widely-used [software](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Tools-Pascal-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0201103427/)
[tools](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Computing-Biologists-Steven-Haddock/dp/0878933913/),
[evidence](https://www.amazon.com/How-Learning-Works-Research-Based-Principles/dp/0470484101/)-[based](https://www.amazon.com/Small-Teaching-Everyday-Lessons-Learning/dp/1118944496/)
[pedagogy](https://www.amazon.com/Teaching-What-You-Dont-Know/dp/0674035801/),
and [community](https://www.amazon.com/Unearthing-Seeds-Fire-Idea-Highlander/dp/0895870193/)
[organization](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Powerful-Community-Organizations-Personal/dp/0977151808/).
Similarly,
while [Bridge](http://bridgeschool.io/) is remixing ideas
that the founders of the [Mechanics' Institues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics%27_Institutes)
would have instantly recognized,
it is still new, vital, and inspirational.

[Bridge](http://bridgeschool.io/) is now ready to start running classes
with other Toronto-area tech companies.
Their [core team and volunteers](http://bridgeschool.io/about-us/)
are doing what most tech companies only talk about,
and evolving as fast as they can;
if you want to work with them to make the world a better place,
please [give them a shout](mailto:hello@bridgeschool.io).
