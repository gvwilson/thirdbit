Twenty years after writing the first version,
I have posted yet another update to
[my list of unwritten books]({{site.github.url}}/ideas/).
If anything on this list already exists,
I'd be grateful for pointers.
And if you're interested in writing any of them yourself,
please let me know:
I'd be very happy to be your first reader.
