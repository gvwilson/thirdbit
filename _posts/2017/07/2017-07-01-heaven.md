Courage, honesty, and humility are all great virtues,
but the greatest is compassion.
If you don't feel the suffering of others as you would your own,
you have no compass;
if you don't look at a starving child and feel their hunger,
or at someone being beaten down and feel the blows land on you,
then your courage is merely strength,
your honesty all too easily hurtful,
and your humility without purpose.

That's why I believe that if Heaven exists, it must be empty.
No one who is truly compassionate could leave people in pain behind.
If they reached the Pearly Gates they would turn around and come back
because they would believe that decent people don't leave while there's still work to be done,
and that none of us truly belong in Heaven until all of us can go.
