Back in 2010,
Andy Oram and I edited a book called *[Making Software: What Really Works, and Why We Believe It][making-software]*.
In it,
some of the leading lights of empirical software engineering research presented their favorite results
and the methodologies behind them.
My hope was that it would spark development of
[a better software engineering course][better-course];
that hasn't happened yet,
but there are signs that the tide is running the right way.
One is a trio of books that are both broader and deeper than *Making Software*:

-   *[Perspectives on Data Science for Software Engineering][perspectives]* "presents the best practices of seasoned data miners in software engineering."
-   *[The Art and Science of Analyzing Software Data][art-science]* "provides valuable information on analysis techniques often used to derive insight from software data."
-   *[Sharing Data and Models in Software Engineering][sharing]* "presents guidance and procedures for reusing data and models between projects to produce results that are useful and relevant."

Another hopeful sign is Derek Jones' *[Empirical Software Engineering Using R][eseur]*;
while still a draft,
it is closer to being a textbook than the three collections linked above.
It may take another decade for evidence-based introductions to software engineering
to supplant the courses we have today,
but I really do believe it's going to happen.
