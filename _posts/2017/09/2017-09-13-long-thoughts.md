When's the last time you had a long thought?
I remember having thoughts that stretched on for hours
as I worked through basic physics problems
or wrote my first lesson on regular expressions
or read *[Guards! Guards!](https://www.amazon.com/Guards-Playtext-Discworld-Pratchett-1997-05-01/dp/B01K0UFJA0/r)*
for the first time.

It's been a while, though.
These days,
it's rare for me to think about anything for more than five minutes at a time.
Some of it is the intellectual laziness that comes with being comfortably middle-aged,
but some of it is conditioning:
I have spent most of the last ten years fighting fires one frantic email thread at a time,
and reading the news 140 characters at a time,
and in doing so,
I've trained myself to switch tasks every few hundred seconds.

I'm trying to undo that now&mdash;failing so far, but trying.
But I'm curious:
when's the last time you had a long thought,
and what was it?
