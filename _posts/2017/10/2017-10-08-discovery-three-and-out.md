We were really looking forward to *Star Trek: Discovery*.
Finally:
a Star Trek series we could watch together for the first time as a family.
But that dream died halfway through the third episode,
bludgeoned to death by one poorly-lit shot after another of eviscerated corpses.
Torn flesh,
protruding ribs---this isn't what I want my 10-year-old to see right before bedtime.

Whoever you are,
I want you to know that I'm really disappointed in you.
From TOS to *Enterprise*,
*Star Trek* built one of the largest fan bases in history by telling stories that appealed to our better natures,
not by pandering to our worst.
The good you might have done by making a woman of color your central character is moot
if my daughter can't watch your show because it would give her nightmares.
The gore was gratuitous,
and you should be ashamed for not trusting your cast
and the wonderful, complex world you inherited
to carry the story without it.
