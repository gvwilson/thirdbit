Depressing report in the <a href="http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Climate+change+scientists+feel+muzzled+Ottawa+Documents/2684065/story.html#ixzz0iGfOLtWT">Montreal Gazette</a>:
<blockquote>A dramatic reduction in Canadian media coverage of climate change  science issues is the result of the Harper government introducing new  rules in 2007 to control interviews by Environment Canada scientists  with journalists, says a newly released federal document.

"Scientists  have noticed a major reduction in the number of requests, particularly  from high profile media, who often have same-day deadlines," said the  Environment Canada document. "Media coverage of climate change science,  our most high-profile issue, has been reduced by over 80 per cent."</blockquote>
