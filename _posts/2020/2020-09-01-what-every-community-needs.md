Yesterday I wrote that every project should make its governance discoverable.
Here are a few other things that would help programming communities:

-   [tldr pages](https://tldr.sh/): one-line manual pages with practical examples.

-   [explainshell](https://explainshell.com/): automated drill-down explanations of commands.

-   [this vs. that](https://thisthat.dev/): short explanations of the differences between things that are frequently confused.

-   a [glossary](https://glosario.carpentries.org/): preferably subsetted from a shared one because why reinvent the world?

-   [concept maps][concept-maps]: or other remixable illustrations of key ideas.

Please [let me know](mailto:{{site.author.email}}) what else is on your list:
I'm always grateful for pointers.
