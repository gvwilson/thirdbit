*Have you seen Mary Rose Cook's [Gitlet](http://gitlet.maryrosecook.com/docs/gitlet.html)?*

Oh yeah. It's beautiful. I wish I could program like that.

*Well, I'm sure that if you practice...*

No, I mean I wish I could write programs in two columns with explanation on the left and the code itself on the right.

*Oh, you can. You just put specially-formatted comments in your code, then run a script to extract them and---*

Sorry, no, I mean I want to _write_ programs that way---like, actually write them in two columns in my editor.

*Oh. Well, you can't.*

Yeah, I know. But why not?

*...because that's not how it works? The source code for a program is just lines of text, right?
And when editors do a split-pane view, they're just showing two different portions of the same linear text.*

I get that, but if I put a two-cell table into a Word document I can do actual side-by-side editing.

*Sure, but Word doesn't store things as plain text---its document format is actually very complex.*

Right, but I can do the same thing with a WYSIWYG HTML editor, right?
I mean, create a two-cell table and put different text side by side.
I know that's stored as plain text with a bit of markup,
so why can't I do that with programs?

*You can---you just have to write a tool that extracts the code in the cells.
In principle it's no different from using specially-formatted comments.*

I get the feeling we're talking past one another.
I don't want to have to pre-process or post-process or side-process stuff---it'll make debugging a nightmare.

*I'm sorry, but today's programming languages only handle plain text.*

What about the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)?
It stores everything in cells---can't we modify it to show prose and code cells side by side?

*...*

And if we're going to do that,
and if prose cells can contain angle-bracket markup,
can't we embed editable SVG diagrams in the left-hand column as well?

*I knew you were going to go there...*

Yeah, OK, it's a bit of an obsession,
but every programming textbook I have uses diagrams to illustrate data structures or dataflow
or systems architecture or thread scheduling
and I'd really, really like to be able to embed those with my code.

*But you can already! You just have to---*

---launch a separate editing application and create an SVG file
and then add something to the notebook to include it and then look at the rendered version.

*Come on, it's not that bad.*

What it is, is ironic.
Here I am using an interpreted language for programming
because immediacy reduces cognitive load and makes me more productive,
but when I want to _explain_ code,
I'm back to a compile-link-run cycle.
It just feels...backward.

*What are you talking about?
Software is the most innovative industry in history---we're creating the future!*
