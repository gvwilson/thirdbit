Would you like to go to MIT?  Or sit in on their first-year programming lectures (which now use Python)?  Old news, but now you can: course materials and lecture videos are now <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6U-i4gXkLM">online</a>.  I'm way behind this curve---some of the early <a href="http://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> lectures were videotaped back in 1997, and <a href="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~paullu">Paul Lu</a> and I gave some lectures via Skype Video this summer, but that's it. I'd really like to create a high-quality self-paced over-the-web version of the course, but if what I've heard and read is true, an hour of usable material will take 50-100 hours to create. That's... um... carry the three... pretty much a full working year for one person, which means it's unlikely to happen. *sigh*
