Amy Brown, my co-editor on <a href="http://aosabook.org"><em>The Architecture of Open Source Applications</em></a>, is <a href="http://www.arbrown.ca/">available for freelance work</a>. High quality, reasonable rates, knows her way around Lulu and e-book production,  keen eye for detail&mdash;if you're doing print-on-demand (or any other kind of publishing), she's a great investment.
