<p>Once again, Compute Canada has sent out a document for "review" without  leaving time for people to provide meaningful input. And once again, it's all about "big iron", as if scientists were somehow, magically, going to acquire the basic skills needed to write modular code, test it, maintain it, and–oh, what's the use?  I've known for years that the only way we're going to fix this is to show a younger generation of scientists that doing things the right way also makes them more productive, and then wait for them to have enough seniority to fix our backward-looking institutions.</p>
<p>Now, back to trying to figure out how to explain packaging and installation to geologists...</p>
