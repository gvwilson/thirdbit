<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"The real grand challenge for software engineering research is relevance."</em></p>
I'm not particularly observant at the best of times&mdash;it's one of the reasons I don't drive&mdash;but even so, I've been kicking myself for not noticing something about <a href="http://aosabook.org"><em>The Architecture of Open Source Applications</em></a><a> in time to include a note in the introduction. There are over 100 diagrams in the book, only half a dozen of which use any standard modeling notation like UML.  Putting it another way, experienced software architects <em>don't</em> believe that a standard modeling notation is the best way to communicate their ideas roughly 95% of the time.</a> It's not ignorance: I'm positive that everyone who helped write a chapter for the book would immediately recognize UML, and could draw a more-or-less legal class diagram or sequence diagram if asked to. And it wasn't laziness, either, or a side effect of them dumbing down their work for a lay audience.

Of course, that observation raises a question: what do they use instead? What exactly <em>do</em> experienced designers describe when they describe the "architecture" of their software? I think that AOSA is a unprecedented opportunity to find out. A careful analysis of what its contributors do and don't say (the kind of qualitative study typified by several of the chapters in <a href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/makingsoftware.html"><em>Making Software</em></a>) could tell us what modeling notations for software architecture need to include for software architects to find them compelling.

It would be a hell of a paper, but I'm not an academic any more, and <a href="/blog/archives/4165.html">other</a> <a href="https://software-carpentry.org">things</a> are more pressing. If you'd like to take a crack at it, please let me know&mdash;I'd be happy to introduce you to our contributors.
