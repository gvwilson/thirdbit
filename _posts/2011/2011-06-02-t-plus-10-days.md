So how is <a href="http://aosabook.org"><cite>The Architecture of Open Source Applications</cite></a> doing?

1. As of this morning, we have sold 377 print copies and 244 PDF copies, which means we've raised about $5000 for Amnesty International.  This is a little slower than sales of <em>Beautiful Code</em> were in its first two weeks, but better than <em>Making Software</em>; please help get the word out any way you can (and send us links).

2. We've had 88K visitors and 304.5K page views.  Those statistics are slightly distorted by the fact that a couple of people have duplicated the site, and are somehow showing up on Google Analytics&mdash;I'm trying to figure that out&mdash;but they're still healthy numbers.

3. <a href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/index.html#contribute">Translations</a> have started into Chinese (Traditional and Simplified), Japanese, Portuguese (Brazilian and European), Russian, and Spanish, and we've had inquiries about Turkish, French, and Korean.  I had a brief look at using <a href="http://www.globalsight.com">GlobalSight</a> to manage the translation process, but it's not small and my cycles are limited.  If anyone has experience and/or would like to volunteer, please let me know.  And speaking of translations, Ian McDowell of Zeus Technology in Cambridge (England) is putting together a Kindle version, which is proving to be a lot harder than it ought to be in the early 21st Century.  We hope to have it up on Lulu for download and purchase early next week, and then we'll tackle e-pub.  You'd think this would be easy&mdash;you'd be wrong...

4. Work has started on Volume 2&amp;! We've been promised chapters on Mailman, PyPy, and SQLAlchemy, and are actively looking for others in as-yet-uncovered domains.  If there's something you'd particularly like to see, and you know someone whose arm I could twist, please introduce us.  (GDB?  OpenSSH?  Anything for low-power embedded devices?  We'd like <a href="/blog/archives/4217.html">all these</a> and more.)

5. A couple of people have asked about meeting up at <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011">OSCON 2011</a> in Portland in July.  I won't be able to attend, but if someone else would like to set something up on meetup.org or elsewhere, please let me know and I'll share the link.
