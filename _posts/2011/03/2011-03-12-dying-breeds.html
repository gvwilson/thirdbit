When I was teaching at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the late 1990s, a team of archivists was going around recording old-timers so that their tacit knowledge of how you actually do nuclear testing wouldn't be lost.<em></em> A few weeks ago, Bruce Schneier <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/03/pickpockets_are.html">pointed at</a> <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2286010/pagenum/all/">this <em>Slate</em> article</a> about pickpockets disappearing in the US because the mentor-to-apprentice chain had broken down.  I think the same thing almost happened with small memory devices in the 1990s and early 2000s: most people were programming desktop machines with oodles of RAM and CPU that drew power from wall sockets, so they didn't have to worry about packing data structures to save a few bits.  Now that mobile devices are all the rage, it's kind of fun to watch 20-somethings rediscover tricks I learned on a PDP-11/03 in 1981.
