The snow is melting here in Toronto. It was warm enough yesterday for me to ride my bike to work, and to walk my daughter home from daycare.  But other changes are saddening: my sister has been diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer. We won't know for another few days whether she has two months or six, but we know already that there are seasons she will never see again. I'll be heading out there soon to do what I can for her, my parents, and her husband and kids. Until then, all I can think to do is hug my daughter, cry a little, and wish the world was not as it is.
