Another entry in the "why didn't I think of that?" category is <a href="http://churnalism.com/">Churnalism.com</a>; as David Eaves <a href="http://eaves.ca/2011/02/24/lazy-journalist-revealer-this-is-awesome/">explains</a>, it compares "news" articles to a database of press releases to tell you who is just recycling corporate or political spin (kind of like various tools for detecting plagiarism in student coursework).  Brilliant.
