  The title of this post is not grammatically incorrect, and therein
  lies a story. I've had more than a dozen emails
  since <a href="http://aosabook.org"><em>The Architecture of Open
  Source Applications</em></a> was announced saying, "You should do a
  chapter on [name of application goes here]."  My stock reply is now,
  "Yes, you should." Most people don't respond, but the handful who do
  have all said, "I didn't mean <em>you</em>, I
  meant <em>someone</em>." To which I've been tempted to reply, "I
  agree–please mail her/him and let me know what s/he says."
  I've never actually sent that, though; I figure anyone who doesn't
  get the point of the first message won't get it if it's made a
  second time.

  So here it is spelled out: there is no "you". There is no
  "someone". There's me, and Amy Brown, and the individuals who
  volunteered to write chapters and then actually delivered on their
  promise, and there's you, you the person who sent that email, you
  the person who is reading this, you the person who could volunteer
  just like we did and put your head down and take time away from your
  friends, your family, your thesis, your volleyball team, or your
  favorite TV series and write something. That isn't the only way that
  open source and open content happen, but that's where it started,
  and that's how things ranging from this book to Wikipedia came to
  be. If you want a chapter on <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">The
  Gimp</a>
  or <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">Arduino</a>,
  then write it. If you don't know enough to do that, then find some
  people who could and say, "I'd be happy to draw the diagrams and
  proof read and translate from your preferred format into others and
  whatever else it takes if you'll turn what you know into prose."

  I think that making something where nothing existed before
  is the greatest adventure there is. If you'd like to give it a try,
