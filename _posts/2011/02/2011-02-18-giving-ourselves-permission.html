There's a line from Alan Furst's 1930s-era spy novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dark-Star-Novel-Alan-Furst/dp/0375759999/"><em>Dark Star</em></a> that has stuck with me: "We need people who can do good, and not get caught." It came to mind again today as I read <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703584804576144661629994864.html">this WSJ article</a> on social impact bonds: at one level it's inspiring, but at another, it feels like we're trying to give ourselves permission to do good by wedging it into market economics.
