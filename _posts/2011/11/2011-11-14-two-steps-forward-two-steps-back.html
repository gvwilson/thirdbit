The November/December 2011 issue of <em>IEEE Software</em> has a good article by Markus Völter titled, "<a href="http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/so/2011/06/mso2011060020-abs.html">From Programming to Modeling&mdash;and Back Again</a>". In it, the author asks, "What's the difference between programming and modeling? And should there be one?" His answer to the second question is no: instead of today's sharp divide between describing the problem domain, and telling a computer what to do, we should use extensible environments that support a continuum between the two.  I like his description of what's wrong with things today: we shouldn't use concrete syntax as a storage format.  But as with so many other articles on extensible programming, I think he glosses over the biggest practical obstacle such systems face: debugging.  An abstraction's usefulness is limited by how fixable it is when it breaks; if you give me a way to program in pictures, in natural language, or in some domain-specific notation, but then require me to wade through automatically-generated spaghetti code to figure out <em>why</em> my description of what I want isn't doing the right thing, you haven't really helped me very much. I'm still trying to figure out how to reconcile this with the "pile of crap" problem I ranted about in <a href="/blog/archives/4352.html">my previous post</a>, though. If my editor/compiler/debugger are all extensible, then <em>everything</em> I try to do will trip over installation and configuration snags...
