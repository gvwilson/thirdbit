title: We Got a Mention in Comm. ACM
---
<p>The March 2010 issue of <em>Communications of the ACM</em> has an article on grid computing that mentions Software Carpentry and Titus Brown's course at Michigan State–yay!  Unfortunately, Software Carpentry didn't get a URL, and the bit.ly URL for Titus's course currently redirects to the wrong place.</p>
<p><em>Later: the bit.ly URL is apparently working again.</em></p>
