<blockquote><em>The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.</em>
&ndash; HP Lovecraft, <em>The Call of Cthulhu</em></blockquote>
After reading Mike Lofgren's "<a href="http://www.truth-out.org/goodbye-all-reflections-gop-operative-who-left-cult/1314907779">Goodbye to All That: Reflections of a GOP Operative Who Left the Cult</a>" and Paul Krugman's "<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/sep/04/evolution-climate-republicans-president">The Republicans are now the anti-science party</a>", I can only conclude that Perry, Palin, and their ilk have chosen the "peace and safety" option outlined above. Yes, what science is telling us can be scary&mdash;we <em>are</em> making a mess of this planet, and it <em>is</em> going to bite us hard unless we make fundamental changes to our way of life&mdash;but "la la la I can't hear you" is <em>not</em> a helpful response.
