The title says it all: the <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/1929100993">first Ladies Learning Code workshop</a> on Saturday, August 6, at the Centre for Social Innovation in downtown Toronto will be an introduction to JavaScript.  Women and friends alike are welcome, and if you'd like to help teach, they'd like to hear from you.
