Sadie's gran has passed away --- she was 87, and it had been coming on for several years, but we're all still very sad :-(  For the record, when my time comes, I'd like you to (a) recycle everything you can (organs, books, whatever), and (b) get together and tell my jokes one last time.  I figure you've all heard them often enough that this shouldn't be too hard...
