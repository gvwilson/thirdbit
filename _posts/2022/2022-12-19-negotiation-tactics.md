I think I'm pretty good at [talking people into things][talking],
but that's not the same as negotiating.
In light of a couple of conversations over the last few days
I'd like to assemble a collection of strategies for that
classified as shown below:

<div align="center">
  <img src="{{'/files/2022/negotiation-tactics.svg' | relative_url}}" alt="Negotiation Tactics classified as effective vs. ineffective and moral vs. scummy" />
</div>

If you have any to contribute, please [get in touch](mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com).

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th><th>Ineffective</th><th>Effective</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Moral</th>
    <td id="moral-ineffective">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Imposing your own values, not shared values, which doesn't make others want to cooperate with you.
          (though imposing your values may not actually be moral depending how you think about it…) - RHB
        </li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td id="moral-effective">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Setting the tone by agreeing on shared values is quite effective.
          Ensuring that you are interested in a win/win outcome for everyone. - RHB
        </li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Scummy</th>
    <td id="scummy-ineffective">
      <ul>
        <li>Help me out, people…</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td id="scummy-effective">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Negging: to insult with a backhanded compliment or with qualified approval,
          especially as a ploy to lower the self-esteem of a person or cheapen an object
          before showing romantic interest or making an offer. - RHB
        </li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
