I really, really want the ACM to start a "Journal of Comprehensible Explanations"
in which people can publish peer-reviewed summaries of research findings (recent or otherwise)
that are accessible to practitioners.
JCE would specifically _not_ allow reporting of novel discoveries;
instead, articles present novel, peer-reviewed _explanations_.
