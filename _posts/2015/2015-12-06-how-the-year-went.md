<p>
  I wrote a post on New Year's Day
  about things I probably <em>wouldn't</em> do this year.
  Here's my score card:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Turn Software Carpentry into a book: nope, didn't get to it
    (though we <em>did</em> publish our lessons).
  </li>
  <li>
    Turn the instructor training course into something other people can read and understand:
    huh&mdash;it actually happened (kind of).
  </li>
  <li>
    Finish any of the fiction I've been working on:
    nope.
    I tidied up <em>Beneath Coriandel</em> (again),
    but it still needs major surgery to fix some gaping plot holes before it's worth publishing,
    and I didn't touch the others.
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a textbook:
    nope.
  </li>
  <li>
    Start playing the sax again:
    nope.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  What about the things I <em>did</em> think I'd do?
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Get paid: yup.
  </li>
  <li>
     Get the Software Carpentry Foundation on a firm footing:
     that happened,
     but the credit belongs to the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/scf/steering-committee.html">Steering Committee</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Get fit:
    nope.
  </li>
  <li>
    Put together a meeting of grassroots "learn to code" organizations targeting under-represented groups:
    <a href="{{site.github.url}}/2015/06/12/teaching-tech-together.html">it happened</a>,
    though in the end <a href="{{site.github.url}}/2015/11/09/daddy-why-dont-you-ever-laugh.html">I decided not to attend</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Revise <a href="http://sensibleadventures.com/works-in-progress/madica/"><em>Madica</em></a>:
    nope.
    I feel bad about this&mdash;I really wanted to get it ready by Christmas.
  </li>
  <li>
    Move to England:
    part marks,
    since we're only able to stay for half a year.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Given all that,
  my goals for 2016 are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Travel a lot less.
  </li>
  <li>
    Work fewer evenings and weekends.
  </li>
  <li>
    Swim and play the sax a couple of times a week
    (but not at the same time).
  </li>
  <li>
    Buy a house.
    (We're going to rent for a few months after we get back to Toronto,
    but need to find something longer-term by the end of June.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Finish <a href="http://sensibleadventures.com/works-in-progress/madica/"><em>Madica</em></a>
    and <a href="http://sensibleadventures.com/works-in-progress/beneath-coriandel/"><em>Beneath Coriandel</em></a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Train at least half a dozen people to run Software Carpentry instructor training.
  </li>
  <li>
    Figure out what my next big project is going to be.
    I'm going to keep teaching for Software Carpentry,
    but <a href="{{site.github.url}}/2015/09/06/unwritten-and-undone.html">as I wrote in September</a>,
    I'd like to build and ship some software at least once more.
    With luck,
    I'll find a bunch of scientists in Toronto that I could help part-time.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  I'll let you know how it goes...
</p>
