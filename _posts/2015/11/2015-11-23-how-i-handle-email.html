  That comes to about 120 messages a day,
  every day of the week,
  and those are just the ones I bothered to archive.
  Here's how I manage it:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Always do an hour's work in the morning before checking email at
      all.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Don't leave email running in the background: turn it on, do a
      sweep (below), then turn it off.  If you want to send an email
      in the middle of some other task, leave yourself a note in a
      text file for batch processing later.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When you do turn mail on, do one quick pass to archive and
      delete things that don't require replies.  You'll be surprised
      how many threads take care of themselves, or how many things
      other people will answer, or how far the discussion will get
      without you intervening.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Once you've done that pass, go back and do all your composing in
      a batch, because then you'll know which things really need
      replies right now and which can be left.  (If you've made notes
      to yourself while doing other work about email that needs
      processing, now's the time to turn them into messages - again,
      you'll be surprised how many messages <em>don't</em> need to be
      sent once you see what the rest of the world has already said.)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      "But people might need to get hold of me right away for
      emergencies!" OK, then give those people your cell # and ask
      them to text you (or call, if they're my age and still regard
      texting suspiciously).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Don't be afraid to let important-but-not-urgent email pile up,
      but allocate an afternoon each week for clearing it.  Again, do
      this offline&mdash;give yourself space to think medium-sized
      joined-up thoughts.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
