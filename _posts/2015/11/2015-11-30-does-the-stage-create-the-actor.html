<p>
  A lot of coding workshops have sprung up in the last ten years,
  ranging from one-day events to teach people the basics of HTML
  to months-long internships designed to turn participants into professional programmers.
  Having just had yet another stranger solve
  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28144178/jekyll-liquid-number-of-posts-by-month">yet another problem</a>
  for me on Stack Overflow,
  I'm wondering:
  to what extent are Stack Overflow and similar sites responsible for the creation of these workshops?
  SO is a way for people without degrees and other certifications to show what they know;
  without it,
  would people be quite so keen to take part in unofficial training?
