  The incoming Steering Committee will meet with their outgoing counterparts this week
  to start getting up to speed on governance, finance, partnerships, and plans for the coming year.
  We will announce their roles (such as chair and treasurer) as soon as they have been decided.
  Our thanks to the members of the outgoing committee for all their contributions:
