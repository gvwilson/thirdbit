<p>
  I was very pleased to see the announcement today of
  <a href="https://peerj.com/computer-science/">PeerJ Computer Science</a>,
  an open access journal for my discipline
  with a stellar advisory board and over 300 topic editors.
  I've always thought it ironic that the people who made open access possible
  by building the Internet
  have been laggards in adopting it themselves;
  here's hoping that this new venue will help to finally change that.
