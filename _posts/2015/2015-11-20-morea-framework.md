  I first met <a href="http://philipmjohnson.org/">Philip Johnson</a>,
  a professor of Computer Science at the University of Hawaii,
  through shared interests in empirical software engineering research
  and Google Summer of Code.
  He has recently been developed the <a href="http://morea-framework.github.io/">Morea Framework</a>
  for creating structured course websites using GitHub and Jekyll.
  "Morea" stands for "Modules, Outcomes, Readings, Experiences, and Assessments",
  which are the five main elements the framework supports.
  As you can see from the project <a href="http://morea-framework.github.io/gallery.html">gallery</a>,
  it's much more structured than our lessons.
  It also requires more tooling–Morea Framework sites are built using custom Jekyll plugins,
  and the source relies much more heavily on include files than our template–and
  it's geared very strongly toward traditional semester-long courses.

  I'm really impressed with the thought that's gone into Morea,
  and would enjoy hearing what you think.
