Robert Kahn (co-inventor of TCP/IP, among other things) is <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/reg/list_full.pl?20071111-1100.18808">speaking at U of T</a> on Tuesday, December 11.  His talk is titled "Managing Digital Objects on the Net" --- it's open to the public, and I hope to see a lot of you there.
