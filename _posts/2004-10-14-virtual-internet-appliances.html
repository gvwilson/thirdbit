<p>I had mail from <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com">Joel Spolsky</a> yesterday in response to my postings about how difficult it is to get a working Java web development environment set up.  His suggestion?  Give everyone VMWare, and distribute machine images that have everything pre-configured.  The more I think about this, the cooler it gets---does anyone know if anyone's ever actually tried shipping "virtual Internet appliances" this way?</p>
