On April 1, 1942, <a href="http://orwelldiaries.wordpress.com/2012/04/01/1-4-42/">George Orwell wrote</a>:
<blockquote>Connolly wanted yesterday to quote a passage from <em>Homage to Catalonia </em>in his broadcast. I opened the book and came on these sentences:

"One of the most horrible features of war is that all the war-propaganda, all the screaming and lies and hatred, comes invariably from people who are not fighting…It is the same in all wars; the soldiers do the fighting, the journalists do the shouting, and no true patriot ever gets near a front line trench, except on the briefest of propaganda tours. Sometimes it is a comfort to me to think that the aeroplane is altering the conditions of war. Perhaps when the next great war comes we may see that sight unprecedented in all history, a jingo with a bullet-hole in him."

Here I am...less than 5 years after writing that. I suppose sooner or later we all write our own epitaphs.</blockquote>
