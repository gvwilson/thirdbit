I subscribe to several general-interest science blogs: <em>Nature</em>'s "<a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/">The Great Beyond</a>", <em>Seed</em> magazine's "<a href="http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/index.php">ScienceBlogs</a>", and a few that are more specialized.  What I <em>don't</em> have in my blog roll is a blog that covers what's new and interesting in Computer Science.  There are lots for computer-related technology, programming, and what-not, but the closest I can find to a regular overview of what's new in CS is "<a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/">Lambda the Ultimate</a>", which focuses almost exclusively on programming language research.  Dear Lazy Web, am I missing something?  Is someone already blogging about what's new and cool in our field, or even in particular subfields like software engineering or computer vision?  Or is there a "Planet CS" somewhere that aggregates researchers' blogs in the way that <a href="http://planet.python.org/">Planet Python</a> aggregates news from members of the Python community?  If there isn't, it'd be a great way for a grad student with time on her hands to become rich, famous, and popular (well, two out of three, anyway).
