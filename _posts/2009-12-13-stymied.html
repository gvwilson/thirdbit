A few weeks ago, I <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/3202.html">asked for pointers</a> to something that would translate 400-odd partial paper citations (usually just author names and paper titles) into full bibliography entries.  So far, none of the proposed solutions have worked out:
<ol>
	<li>Bibsonomy's search only found 2 of the 10 papers I tried it on manually.</li>
	<li>JabRef did no better.</li>
	<li>CrossRef found none.</li>
	<li>The "<a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/523047/">possibly working Python script</a>" for querying Google Scholar, and my home-grown attempts to do likewise, produced nothing but "your agent isn't allowed access" messages. (Yes, I've included all the same headers that Firefox sends when I do searches manually---doesn't make a difference. Google, they smart.)</li>
	<li>I didn't get cb2bib to run on Mac OS X. Admittedly, I only tried for ten minutes, but this isn't a critical path project for me.</li>
</ol>
*sigh*
