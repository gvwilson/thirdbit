Susan Baxter and others at the National Center for Genome Resources in the US have just published an article titled <a href="http://compbiol.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020087">"Scientific Software Development Is Not An Oxymoron"</a> in <a href="http://compbiol.plosjournals.org/"><em>PLoS Computational Biology</em></a>. It makes many of the same points as the <a href="http://www.swc.scipy.org">Software Carpentry </a>course, and includes pointers to examples of bioinformatics projects that meet the standards we expect of real science.

<strong>Update</strong>: "Not an Oxymoron" is the most-viewed article this week at <a href="http://compbiol.plosjournals.org/"><em>PLoS Computational Biology</em></a><em>!</em>
