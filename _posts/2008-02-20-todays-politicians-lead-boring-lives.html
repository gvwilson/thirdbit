One day in September 1197 the effective ruler of Outremer, Henry of Champagne, was reviewing his troops from a window of his palace at Acre when a delegation from the local Pisan colony entered the room behind him.  He turned to greet them, and a few moments later thoughtlessly stepped backward. His little dwarf, Scarlet, seized his clothes in an attempt to stop him, but it was too late. Together, the two crashed to the ground below. Scarlet escaped with a broken leg; Henry was killed.
