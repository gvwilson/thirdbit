I didn't grow up in a developing [1] country, so anything I have to say about the <a href="http://www.laptop.org">One Laptop Per Child</a> program should be taken with a large grain of salt.  <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jaranda">Jorge Aranda</a>, on the other hand, is from Mexico, so I think his "<a href="http://catenary.wordpress.com/2007/04/15/a-friendly-criticism-of-the-one-laptop-per-child-project/">Friendly Criticism of OLPC</a>" posting deserves a wide audience.
