As reported two weeks ago, <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/08/data-is-journalism-msnbc-acqui.html">MSNBC has acquired EveryBlock</a>, a web-based tool that aggregates crime data, restaurant reviews, health inspections, local news and more. Adrian Holovaty, its creator, is one of the driving forces behind Django, and has <a href="http://www.holovaty.com/writing/everyblock-acquisition/">promised</a> that the open-sourced EveryBlock code will stay that way. Would this be a good platform on which to build apps for the City of Toronto?  This <a href="http://www.nowtoronto.com/lifestyle/technology.cfm?content=162058"><em>NOW</em> magazine article</a> from 2008 asked that same question; maybe 2009 will be the year it happens.

And while we're on the subject, take a look at Iain Grant's directory of <a href="http://twitter411.ca/">Toronto Twitter feeds</a>, or his <a href="http://tofire.ca/">tofire.ca</a> site. Neat!
