In homage to <a href="http://www.ninja-cowboy-bear.com/index.php"><em>The Legend of Ninja, Cowboy, Bear</em></a>, Adam Goucher has written a fairy tale about three kinds of software testers: <a href="http://adam.goucher.ca/?p=940">zealots, anarchists, and robots</a>. Cute, but also thought-provoking.
