<a href="http://www.openusability.org/">OpenUsability</a>'s <a href="http://season.openusability.org/">Season of Usability</a> is a series of sponsored student projects to encourage students of usability, user-interface design, and interaction design to get involved with Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects. Students experience the interdisciplinary and collaborative development of user interface solutions in international software projects while getting into FLOSS development.

If you are a student of design, usability, human factors, or other HCI-related field and you are interested in working on an open source project, you could work with an experienced usability mentor on a fun and interesting design project (including the University of Toronto's <a href="https://stanley.cdf.toronto.edu/drproject/csc49x/olm_rails">OLM</a>). As a bonus for working 10-15 hours a week between June 1 and August 31, there is a $1000 USD internship stipend at the end of the project.  For more details, see the <a href="http://season.openusability.org/">Season of Usability</a> site.
