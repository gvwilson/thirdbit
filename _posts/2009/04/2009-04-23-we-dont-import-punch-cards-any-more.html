<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/oslo/dd727740.aspx">Interesting talk</a> from Magnus Christerson and Shane Clifford about intentional programming (<a href="http://www.intentsoft.com/">Charles Simonyi</a>'s "next big thing").  Starts a bit slowly, then accelerates; I particularly liked the off-hand characterization of all of today's widely-used languages as glorified punch cards.  I think---I hope---that the demo starting around 14:00 is a glimpse of the future of programming.

Coincidentally, I also finally had time to read up on <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/pig/">Pig</a>, the Apache <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> project's equivalent of Google's <a href="http://research.google.com/archive/sawzall.html">Sawzall</a> language for working with very large data sets---both are essentially "what we should do these days instead of SQL". Interesting to think about how domain-specific languages like this will proliferate and interoperate if the intentional/extensible folks are right.

Until then, there's <a href="http://vimperator.org/trac/wiki/Vimperator">Vimperator</a>... :-)
