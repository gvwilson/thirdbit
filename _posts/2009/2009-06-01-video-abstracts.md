<a href="http://www.quantiki.org/">Quantiki</a> (a web site devoted to quantum information science, which I do not expect I will ever understand) is now hosting <a href="http://www.quantiki.org/video_abstracts">video abstracts</a> for papers. As their site says, "The abstracts provide a 'teaser' for the paper and should guide the audience into your work, emphazising what you think is the most important result." This is very cool; so are the <a href="http://download.cell.com/mmcs/journals/0092-8674/PIIS009286740900378X.mmc2.mov">video</a> that accompanied the paper in <em>Cell</em> about the effects of adding the human FOXp2 gene to mice, and the <a href="http://csmythbusters.cs.ualberta.ca/">CS Mythbusters</a> competition being run in Alberta. Is it time to start requiring all of my students to do videos on a regular basis? We complain a lot that the general public doesn't understand what we do; how much would this help?
