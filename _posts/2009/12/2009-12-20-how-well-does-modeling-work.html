The <a href="http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/~eamde/site/content_home.php">EA-MDE project</a>, led by <a href="http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/~whittljn/">John Whittle</a>, aims to empirically assess the efficacy of model-driven software engineering.  To be useful, it needs the participation of as many companies as possible. The easiest way to help is to fill in <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/FGFTS38">this short survey</a>, but they are also looking for companies/practitioners that would accept an interview to discuss more in detail these success/failure factors.  You can follow their <a href="http://eamde.blogspot.com/">project blog</a> to track their progress.
