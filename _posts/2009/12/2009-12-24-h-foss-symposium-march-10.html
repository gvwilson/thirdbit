The <a href="http://www.hfoss.org/">Humanitarian Free Open Source Software</a> initiative is holding its next <a href="http://www.hfoss.org/hfoss2010/">symposium</a> on March 10 in Milwaukee to coincide with <a href="http://sigcse.org/sigcse2010/">SIGCSE 2010</a>. If I can find <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/3050.html">a way to get there that doesn't violate my "no fly" pledge</a>, I'd really like to attend; if you're going to be in the area, you should check it out too.
