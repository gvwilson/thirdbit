We're about to release version 0.6 of <a href="http://basieproject.org">Basie</a>, a replacement for <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org">Trac</a> built on <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. Before we dive into work on 0.7 at the beginning of January, we'd welcome some code and design reviews from experienced Django and jQuery developers. We have some nice <a href="http://www.cafepress.ca/Basie.395306034">coffee mugs</a> to send as thank-yous...
