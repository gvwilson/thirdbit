title: "Fossil + NoSQL ?"

<a href="http://www.fossil-scm.org/">Fossil</a>, from the creator of <a href="http://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a>, combines a distributed version control system, wiki, and tickets, all bundled into a single file<a href="http://www.sqlite.org"></a>. Given some serious work on its UI, it could grow into an interesting competitor for <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org">Trac</a>, though it replicates the latter's weaknesses (one project per installation, no support for mailing lists or chat, etc.). I'm curious if anyone is working on anything similar using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL">NoSQL</a> database of some kind (particularly if that DB is embedded). Pointers would be welcome.

(P.s. particularly especially if it's <em>not</em> written in C, like Fossil...)
