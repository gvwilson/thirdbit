	<li>Tim Weiner's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Legacy-Ashes-History-Tim-Weiner/dp/0307389006"><em>Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA</em></a> is a darning indictment of an "intelligence" agency that has an unparalleled half-century record of failure: "darning" rather than "damning" because the author's obvious anger makes the book sound one-sided.</li>
	<li><em>The Year's Best Science Fiction</em> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Years-Best-Science-Fiction-Twenty-Fifth/dp/B002IT5OQG">25th</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Years-Best-Science-Fiction-Twenty-Sixth/dp/0312551053">26th</a> editions): gems of all shapes and colors.</li>
	<li>Freeman &amp; Pryce: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627"><em>Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests</em></a>. The heart of the book, a multi-chapter worked example, is the most accessible description of how to break applications along their seams to make them testable since Feathers' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052"><em>Working Effectively With Legacy Code</em></a>.</li>
	<li>Louis Bayard's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Black-Tower-Novel-P-S/dp/0061173517"><em>The Black Tower</em></a> is what Dumas would write if he were alive today (and not being paid by the word).</li>
