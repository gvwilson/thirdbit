	<li>The <em>Toronto Star</em>'s <a href="http://thestar.blogs.com/maps/2009/11/nov11-draft.html">Map of the Week</a> shows where in Toronto the Canadian casualties of WWI lived. Humbling.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/">Sunlight Foundation</a>'s goal is greater transparency in government. Laudable, but I think the inverse of <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Gilmore">Gilmore's Rule</a> will hold as it always has: criminality will interpret openness as a threat and route around it. Still, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queen">Red Queen's Race</a> is better than outright defeat.</li>
