We're going to run some cross-country undergrad capstone projects again starting in January---the newly-updated <a href="http://ucosp.wordpress.com/about/">UCOSP FAQ</a> has some details, and I'll post a note on that blog when we finalize the project list. Please help us get word out to profs and students who might want to take part.
