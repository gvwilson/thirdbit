Jon Pipitone, a grad student here at the University of Toronto, has <a href="http://skoolr.blogspot.com/2009/11/scientific-software-quality-what-would.html">posted a question</a> on his blog: what would it take to convince you (a software engineer) that a piece of complex climate modeling software was working correctly?  It's a hard question --- he'd welcome your suggestions.
