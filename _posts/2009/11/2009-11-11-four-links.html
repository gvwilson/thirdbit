Email is down---strange how hard I find it to get started in the morning without my regular fix. While I'm waiting for someone to turn the firehose back on, here are four recent links:
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://damncoolpics.blogspot.com/2009/11/best-hand-painting-art-ever.html">The Best Hand Painting Art Ever</a>. Gosh, we're a creative species, aren't we?</li>
	<li><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=101931">Ripley: Automatically Securing Web 2.0 Applications Through Replicated Execution</a>. A new project at Microsoft Research that tries to prevent evildoers from subverting rich internet applications by duplicating execution server-side. Neat idea.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.startupnorth.ca/2009/11/09/cix-top-20-announced/">CIX Top 20</a>. Lots of interesting companies here; lots of good ideas.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://golang.org/">Go Programming Language</a>. I'm underwhelmed: it's as if the last 20 years of programming language research hadn't happened. Now, Google backing Haskell... <em>That</em> would be interesting.</li>
</ol>
