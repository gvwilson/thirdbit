I set up a Google Group to communicate with the contributors to the book on <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/category/ebse">evidence-based software engineering</a> that I'm pulling together for O'Reilly, but have run into some registration snags.  I invited everyone into the group using their regular email addresses, but Google isn't letting some of them confirm (which means they don't get email sent to the group).  They <em>can</em> confirm when I invite them via a GMail address, but they don't read that regularly, and anyway, this stuff is just supposed to work, right?  Has anyone run into this before?  If so, what's the cure?
