The <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2010/about/">PyCon 2010</a> committee has just <a href="http://blog.basieproject.org/?p=1513">accepted our talk about Basie</a> --- we'll see you in Atlanta in February!

<em>Update: but getting there by train or bus will take almost 24 hours. My resolution not to fly for a year is being severely tested... :-(</em>
