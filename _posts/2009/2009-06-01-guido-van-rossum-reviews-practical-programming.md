Nice to have our book <a href="http://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2009/05/so-you-want-to-learn-python.html">reviewed</a> by the creator of the language we're using :-) More reviews would be welcome (especially on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Programming-Introduction-Computer-Science/dp/1934356271">Amazon.com</a>)—we'd really like to hear what current and potential readers/users think.
