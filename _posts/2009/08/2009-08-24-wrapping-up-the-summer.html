One by one and two by two our summer students are wrapping up:
<ul>
	<li>Eben Hailemariam has moved the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/featdiag/">Eclipse feature diagram plugin</a> to Google Code, and has posted a screencast showing the latest progress.</li>
	<li>Maria Yancheva's <a href="http://abelian-grape.blogspot.com/2009/08/demo-server-screencast-poster.html">MediaWiki search plugin</a> has a screencast too.</li>
	<li>Brent Mombourquette's <a href="http://climatetooldev.blogspot.com/2009/08/google-code-page.html">Breadcrumbs plugin for Firefox</a> is up on Google Code too.</li>
	<li>Ainsley Lawson and Sarah Strong have finished their <a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/ainsley/2009/08/wrapping-up.html">TracSNAP</a> plugin (which draws social network graphs based on code), and uploaded it to TracHacks.</li>
</ul>
I'll post more as they come in. Well done, everyone---it's been a great four months.
