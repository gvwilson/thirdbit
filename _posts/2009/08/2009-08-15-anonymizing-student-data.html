Andrew Petersen, a lecturer in computer science at the University of Toronto at Mississauga, has <a href="http://utmandrew.wordpress.com/2009/08/09/anonymous-aggregation-of-student-data/">posted</a> a description of a system a summer intern built to anonymize student data. Basically, this system allows instructors to ask questions like, "Is success in the first-year calculus course a predictor of performance in a second-year algorithms course?" <em>without</em> giving them access to information about individual students. It's a good example of what <a href="http://www.schneier.com/">Bruce Schneier</a>, <a href="http://privacy.cs.cmu.edu/people/sweeney/">Latanya Sweeney</a>, and many others are trying to figure out how to do in general: give those who need it access to information in general, while not compromising any one individual's privacy.
