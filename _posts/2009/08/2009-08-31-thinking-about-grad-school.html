<a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/apetersen/">Andrew Petersen</a> (a lecturer in computer science at the <a href="http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/mcs.0.html">University of Toronto at Mississauga</a>) has written a <a href="http://utmandrew.wordpress.com/2009/08/29/should-i-attend-grad-school-in-computer-science/">very good post</a> about deciding whether or not to attend grad school.  If you're starting your final lap as an undergrad, now's the time to start weighing your options, and Andrew's post is a good guide to what you should be thinking about.
