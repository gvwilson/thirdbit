Via <em>Nature</em>'s <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2009/08/industry_wants_to_try_climate_1.html">"Great Beyond"</a>, this story from the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/la-na-climate-trial25-2009aug25,0,3782650.story?track=rss">Los Angeles Times</a>:
<blockquote>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce...wants to put the science of climate change on trial... The chamber is pushing for the Environmental Protection Agency to hold a public hearing -- with witnesses, cross-examinations and a judge to rule on whether humans are causing global warming... [Its] goal...is to guard against potential emissions regulations by undermining the scientific consensus on climate change.</blockquote>
Not "show us in a forum we're familiar with that this is really happening", which I would understand, but "give us a chance to undermine the scientific consensus using the tricks that we know best". Don't they ever wonder whether their children will forgive them?
