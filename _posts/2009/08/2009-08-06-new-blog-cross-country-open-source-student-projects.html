I've mentioned <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/2692.html">a couple</a> <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/2769.html">of times</a> that we're running some capstone projects this fall with students from several universities across Canada.  The <a href="http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/~csc490h/fall/#canada">list of projects</a> has grown, and we now have 21 students signed up, with more in the pipeline, so I've created <a href="http://ucosp.wordpress.com/">a separate blog</a> to keep track of it all.  I'll be giving the students write access, and asking each team to post their thoughts and progress weekly; hope you'll add it to your feeds.
