I've been meaning to blog about this one for a couple of weeks: the 2009 edition of the <a href="http://www.cutc.ca/2009/">Canadian Undergraduate Technology Conference</a> will be held March 12-13 at the Toronto Hilton. This is not just about computing and IT: there's nanomaterials, bioengineering, and lots more. Schedule still isn't up, though, so I can't provide more details.  Students who have gone in the past have enjoyed it a lot; I look forward to hearing what this year's think.
