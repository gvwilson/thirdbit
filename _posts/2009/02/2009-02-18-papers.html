<a href="http://www.lsi.upc.edu/~jcabot/">Jordi Cabot</a> and I submitted the rewrite of our survey of software project portals last Friday; the <a href="http://www.cs.ua.edu/~SECSE09/">SE-CSE'09</a> paper summarizing the results of our survey of <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/1764.html">how scientists use computers</a> is almost done, and I've got a few minutes to kill before two students arrive from the <a href="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca">University of Alberta</a> for our reading week code sprint, so here's a quick list of some papers I've read so far this year that I've liked:
<ul>
	<li>DeLine, Czerwinski, Meyers, Venolia, Drucker, and Robertson: "Code Thumbnails: Using Spatial Memory to Navigate Source Code". <em>Proc. VL-HCC'06</em>. Put thumbnails of code files in the scroll bar so that people can navigate to them "by shape", then measure whether it works (it does).</li>
	<li>Plimmer, Grundy, Hosking, and Priest: "Inking in the IDE: Experiences with Pen-Based Design and Annotation". <em>Proc. VL-HCC'06</em>. Use tablets to integrate hand-drawn design and annotation with three IDEs and see what people do. (Answer: cool things.)</li>
	<li>Bogart, Burnett, Cypher, and Scaffidi: "End-User Programming in the Wild: A Field Study of CoScripter Scripts". <em>Proc. VL-HCC'08</em>. <a href="http://coscripter.research.ibm.com/coscripter/browse/">CoScripter</a> is a very cool tool for recording and playing back web macros. This study looked at how people actually use it, and how they re-used other people's work.</li>
	<li>Hearty, Fenton, Marquez, and Neil: "Predicting Project Velocity i nXP Using a Learning Dynamic Bayesian Network Model". <em>IEEE Trans. Software Engineering</em>, 35(1), Jan/Feb'09. My first reaction was "double bandwagon" (neural nets and XP), but like all of Norman Fenton's work, it's meticulous and solidly grounded.</li>
	<li>Abraham and Erwig: "Mutation Operators for Spreadsheets". <em>IEEE Trans. Software Engineering</em>, 35(1), Jan/Feb'09. Describes a coherent set of operators for mutating spreadsheets to do test-case generation.  Nice to see software engineering researchers taking the world's most widely used declarative programming system seriously :-).</li>
</ul>
