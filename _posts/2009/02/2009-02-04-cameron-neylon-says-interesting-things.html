This time, he has blogged about <a href="http://blog.openwetware.org/scienceintheopen/2009/02/04/best-practice-for-data-availability-%E2%80%93-the-debate-startswell-over-there-really/">best practices for making scientific data available</a>. I think this kind of thing will have a much bigger impact on scientists' productivity than any amount of parallel supercomputing, and that computer scientists could have a lot of impact by helping "real" scientists figure out how to do it better.
