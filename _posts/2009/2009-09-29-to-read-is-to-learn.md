Lots of people have said that computer science students should read code as well as write it.  Not many people have gone the next step and designed a course around that idea, which is why I was excited to read Jason Montojo's <a href="http://www.jaysnothere.com/blog/?p=74">recent post</a>, and the <a href="http://www.jaysnothere.com/cs-art-history/">course outline</a> he has put together.  Jason did several undergrad projects with me, is one of the co-authors on <em>Practical Programming</em>, and plans to finish his M.Sc. in a few months—if anyone can pull this off, he can, and I'm sure he'd welcome your feedback.
