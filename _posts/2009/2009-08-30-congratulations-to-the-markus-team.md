MarkUs, a Rails-based tool for marking student programming assignments, just released <a href="http://blog.markusproject.org/?p=238">Version 0.5</a>. MarkUs aims to provide the convenience and flexibility of pen-and-paper marking over the web; it will be deployed this fall at the University of Toronto, and is one of the eight <a href="http://ucosp.wordpress.com">cross-country open source projects</a> we'll be working on starting in---um, really? Just one week from now?

And speaking of the fall, Bill Konrad has posted some ideas about <a href="http://blog.basieproject.org/?p=917">what's next for Basie</a>. If you have preferences, we'd be grateful for your input.
