<ul>
	<li>Jason Montojo is trying to <a href="http://www.jaysnothere.com/blog/?p=71">figure out</a> how to operationalize some aspects of expertise --- he'd welcome your suggestions.  How do you tell if one programmer is better than another?</li>
	<li>Aran Donohue has posted <a href="http://littlecomputerscientist.wordpress.com/2009/06/02/draft-thesis-abstract-and-introduction/">a few hundred words</a> about his intended research (debugging DSLs). He has also <a href="http://littlecomputerscientist.wordpress.com/2009/06/02/notes-on-some-cognitive-models-of-debugging/">summarized</a> some papers on cognitive models of debugging.</li>
	<li>Rory Tulk is thinking about <a href="http://rorytulk.blogspot.com/2009/06/user-study-for-mutation-based-testing.html">user studies and mutation testing</a>.</li>
	<li>Jeremy Handcock was <a href="http://aperte.org/2009/06/02/google-wave-and-collaborative-tools/">initially lukewarm</a> about <a href="http://wave.google.com/">Google Wave</a>, but upon reflection, sees some neatness.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.basieproject.org">Basie</a> students have <a href="http://blog.basieproject.org/?p=769">an AJAX SVN browser</a> working and are <a href="http://blog.basieproject.org/?p=776">switching to Whoosh</a> for search. We should have some more screencasts up later this week and early next.</li>
</ul>
