We get our electricity from <a href="http://www.bullfrogpower.com/">Bullfrog</a>, which supplies power from renewable sources.  I recently found their "<a href="http://www.bullfrogpower.com/powered/greenindex.cfm">Bullfrog Powered</a>" list and their <a href="http://www.bullfrogpower.com/powered/directory.cfm">Green Directory</a>, both of which list Bullfrog's customers.  It's cool, but what I <em>really</em> want is a downloadable list that I can throw onto a Google Map.  Nice to have either way, though; we'll be checking the list before shopping in the months to come.
