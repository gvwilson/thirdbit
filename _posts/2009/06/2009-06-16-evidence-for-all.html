All Canadians now have <a href="http://blog.marsdd.com/2009/06/16/evidence-based-medicine-for-all/">access to the Cochrane Library</a>, a (more like "the") collection of evidence-based medicine reviews and a critical health sciences resource. If you'd like to have a look, go to the <a href="http://www.cochrane.org/">Cochrane site</a>; if you'd like access to continue, please sign <a href="http://nlccl.epetitions.net/">the petition</a>.
