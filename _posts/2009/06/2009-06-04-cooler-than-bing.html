Two things that are cooler than Microsoft's new search engine:
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://www.google.com/squared">Google Squared</a>: wow.  And I'm not the only one who <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/06/google-squared-is-an-exponenti.html">thinks so</a> [1].</li>
	<li>Microsoft's own <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/guest-simon-sketchflow">SketchFlow</a>: a workflow-centric (rather than page-centric) tool for prototyping web sites.  With stuff like this going on, why is MS still trying to go head-to-head with Google on G's home turf?</li>
</ol>
[1] But please, everyone: "exponential" doesn't mean "reall big", so please stop using it that way.
