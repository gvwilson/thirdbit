I really did mean to blog several times a day about this term's <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/2092.html">code sprint</a>, but too much was happening during the day, and I was too tired at night. There were lots of high points:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://andrewtrusty.com/">Andrew Trusty</a>, <a href="http://hyfen.net/">Andrew Louis</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/shazow/">Andrey Petrov</a>, Severin Gehwolf, and Blake Winton came out for part or all of it to help, just because. Thanks, guys.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pysync/">PyVCal</a> team, who are building an abstraction library on top of <a href="http://www.perforce.com">Perforce</a>, <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>, and <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, got some scripts working with all three, and Derek Kwok started building a mock implementation of the API to use in testing.</li>
	<li>The OLM team made huge strides forward: marking, some major simplification of their data model, and lots more.</li>
	<li>Basie (the rebuild of <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a> on <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>) also made huge strides: we have charts (using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flot/">Flot</a>), a partly-AJAXed ticketing system, user preference pages, lots of new UI design, more wikification, and lots of other things that I'm forgetting right now.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~reid">Karen Reid</a> and I started using <a href="http://twitter.com/gvwilson">Twitter</a>. But we could quit any time, honest.</li>
</ul>
Many thanks once again to Alan Rosenthal, Vlad Sekulic, and especially <a href="http://blog.codekills.net/">David Wolever</a> for tech support, and to Jason Whyne, <a href="http://www.lizblankenship.com/">Liz Blankenship</a>, Heather Grant, and James Leung for coming all the way to Toronto to hack for three days.
