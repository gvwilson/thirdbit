MIT Press has kindly given me permission to put my first book, <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=8185"><em>Practical Parallel Programming</em></a>, up on the web.   Many of the specifics are out of date, but I think (at least, I hope) much of the discussion is still useful.

One problem, though: nobody has the electronic source for the book's hundred or more diagrams.  I spent a couple of weeks sketching them with a pencil and straight edge in the <a href="http://www.vu.nl">VU</a> library in the summer of 1994; a graphic artist in Boston then re-drew them using a Mac, but those files are long gone.  I could chop a copy of the book and scan what I need as PNGs, but it got me wondering about OCR software for vector images.  If anyone can recommend something, I'd welcome a pointer.
