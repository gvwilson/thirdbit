A month ago, Mayor David Miller <a href="http://visiblegovernment.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=86&amp;Itemid=29">announced</a> Toronto's plan to open up its data to its citizens (and the rest of the world).  Over on his blog, David Crow is now musing about ways to <a href="http://davidcrow.ca/toronto/7154/whats-your-open-data-idea">inspire the community to build</a> applications, services, and business on top of that data.  My plan is to run my <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/2337.html">consulting course</a> in the fall term (September to December), and give the grad and undergrad students who take it credit for leveraging whatever information they can in some useful way.  We'll have a better idea in July or August of exactly what's going to be available; hope you'll all chime in with suggestions for things the students could do.
