In the wake of Obama's announcement that his administration aims to spend <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Obama-promises-major-apf-15039606.html">3% of GDP on scientific research</a>, a lot of people have been asking how Canada will respond.  The answer, at least for some Canadians, is to change the law <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2009/04/30/cgy-bill-evolution-law-alberta-classes-teachers.html">to allow parents to pull their children out of classes in which evolution is discussed</a>. *sigh*
