In the wake of Toronto's announcement that <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/2460.html">it's opening up its data</a> comes <a href="http://eaves.ca/2009/05/14/vancouver-enters-the-age-of-the-open-city/">a similar advance in Vancouver</a>.  Those of you looking for research and business opportunities as well as a chance to make the places you live more livable, dive in!

And if you're going to be a graduate or senior undergraduate student in Computer Science at the University of Toronto this fall, and would like to get course credit for doing something wonderful with all this data, please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@cs.toronto.edu">give me a shout</a>.
