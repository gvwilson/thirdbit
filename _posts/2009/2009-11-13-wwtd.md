The saddest part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett">Terry Pratchett's Alzheimer's</a> is, well, the Alzheimer's. The second saddest is that no one else writing in English today would be able to use <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8353000/8353068.stm">tree-eating crabs</a> in a story quite as deftly as he could. Food falls down from the sky without anyone (or any crab) knowing where it comes from? Just think where he could go from there...
