I just finished reading Daryl Gregory's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pandemonium-Daryl-Gregory/dp/0345501160"><em>Pandemonium</em></a>, a matter-of-fact heartbreaker about an alternate world in which demonic possession is a fact of life. I had the same reaction to it that I had when I first encountered Charles Petzold's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Annotated-Turing-Through-Historic-Computability/dp/0470229055"><em>The Annotated Turing</em></a>: "Damn, I wish I'd written that." I don't think anyone's ever had that reaction to any book or software I've ever written (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Code-Leading-Programmers-Practice/dp/0596510047"><em>Beautiful Code</em></a> doesn't count---I only edited it). I don't have anything on the go that's likely to either, at least not in the 416 days that remain in my contract with <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu">U of T</a>.

So how about you? When's the last time you saw or heard or used something that you didn't just like, but wished that you could take credit for?
