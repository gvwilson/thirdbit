415 days to go; here's an update my last "<a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/1859.html">things I'd like to accomplish</a>" post:
<ol>
	<li>Help Samira, Jeremy, and Carolyn finish their Master's theses: done.</li>
	<li>Get Aran, Alecia, Alicia, Zachary, Jason, and Rory through theirs: some progress.  Alecia, Alicia, and Rory have topics; Aran and Jason are converging (I hope); Zak's reading papers with Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~azadeh/">Azadeh Farzan</a>, and hopefully that will lead to something for him.</li>
	<li>Publish <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/gwpy/practical-programming"><em>Practical Programming</em></a>: due out in a couple of weeks.</li>
	<li>Finish the study of how scientists actually use computers: some progress.  Our first paper has been accepted for <a href="http://www.cs.ua.edu/~SECSE09/">SE-CSE'09</a> in Vancouver in May, and Carolyn has started thinking about the design of a follow-up survey, but I haven't even started the article I owe <a href="http://www.amsci.org"><em>American Scientist</em></a>.</li>
	<li>Co-edit a special issue of <a href="http://cise.aip.org/"><em>Computing in Science &amp; Engineering</em></a> on software engineering and computational science: one article has come in, four more are in the works, we're starting to line up reviewers.</li>
	<li>Submit a proposal for a professional master's program: mostly done (which is good, since noon Friday is a hard cutoff).</li>
	<li>Finish rebuilding <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a> on top of <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>: some progress this term (including a very fun <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/2116.html">code sprint</a>), and I'll have three students working on it this summer.</li>
	<li>Rewrite <a href="http://swc.scipy.org">Software Carpentry</a>.  No progress (which is unfortunate, since I'm hoping to re-run the course this summer in Toronto).</li>
	<li>Figure out what to do next: this wasn't on the last list, but it should have been.  I'm open to suggestions...</li>
</ol>
