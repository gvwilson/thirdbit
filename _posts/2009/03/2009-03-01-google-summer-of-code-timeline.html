The <a href="http://code.google.com/opensource/gsoc/2009/faqs.html#0_1_timeline_5354032302481437_">GSoC 2009 schedule</a> looks like this:
<ul>
	<li>March 9-13: organizations sign up</li>
	<li>March 18: organization list published; student discussion starts</li>
	<li>March 23-April 3: student applications</li>
	<li>April 20: acceptance notification</li>
	<li>May 23-August 10: talk, code, review, repeat</li>
	<li>August 24: final evaluation deadline</li>
</ul>
Once again, it's very (very) late for Canadian students: April 20 is two weeks after the end of classes at U of T :-(.
