The cheapest kind of social graph is just a count of how many people in the room you know.  Going through the <a href="http://democamp.eventbrite.com/">Eventbite page for DemoCamp 19</a>, I came up with:
<table border="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Current/former project students:</td>
<td>12</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Other current/former U of T students:</td>
<td>6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>U of T faculty:</td>
<td>3 (including me)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Other U of T contacts:</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>People I know through DemoCamp:</td>
<td>20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Names I don't recognize:</td>
<td>95</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
45 I know vs. 95 I don't: I've got some work to do...
