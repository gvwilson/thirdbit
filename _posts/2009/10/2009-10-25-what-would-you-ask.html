We're putting together a (very) short survey for people who have bought <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/gwpy/practical-programming"><em>Practical Programming</em></a> (our intro to CS using Python). What do you think would be the most useful questions to ask readers?  The three I've thought of so far are:
<ol>
	<li>How much general programming experience did you have before you bought this book?</li>
	<li>How much Python experience did you have before you bought this book?</li>
	<li>How many of the exercises in the book have you done?</li>
</ol>
Others?
