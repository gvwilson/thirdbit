The idea of licensing software developers has been around almost as long as---well, OK, I haven't done any actual research, but it's been around a long time. It's superficially appealing: if massage therapists and dog groomers need periodic re-certification of their skills in order to practice, why shouldn't programmers? But then comes the hard part of deciding who should do the certification, what should be included in the exams, and the whole project slowly sinks into the sand.

The IEEE Computer Society has just (re-)launched its <a href="http://www2.computer.org/portal/web/certification/csdpbeta">Certified Software Development Professional</a> (CSDP) exam. You can take part in the beta testing from mid-November to mid-December (some restrictions may apply). <a href="http://www2.computer.org/portal/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=c215a769-5125-4980-b62e-c83a28e4bab7&amp;groupId=72508">Topics</a> are wide-ranging (see the list below the cut), but definitely emphasize a process-heavy engineering view of software development---the exam's authors were definitely building dams in their previous lives. The <a href="http://www2.computer.org/portal/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=bbd77606-9f81-4dff-b82e-44c2f74fec9d&amp;groupId=72508">list of reference materials</a> reinforces that: words like "agile" and "Scrum" don't appear (probably because <em>those</em> guys were building backyard stills in their previous lives :-).

I personally think licensure is inevitable: sooner or later, someone's going to find a way to sue software companies for bad products, at which point those companies are going to start insisting on evidence that their bottom lines are in safe hands. I'd be interested to see the results of administering the CSDP exam to a hundred randomly-selected J2EE developers working at insurance companies, and to another hundred Rails developers working for social media startups.  I'd be even more interested in the results for 100 randomly selected Computer Science professors...<!--more-->
