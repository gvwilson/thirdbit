title: "Advice for Jon on Querying Climate Change Data?"

Over at <a href="http://skoolr.blogspot.com/">Skoolr</a>, Jon Pipitone is blogging about his master's thesis project, the aim of which is to create an interface that would allow non-specialists to browse and query climate change data.  Huge numbers of simulations have been done, and most of the results are reachable electronically (not easily, but it can be done).  The problem is figuring out a way to make them <em>accessible</em>, so that TV journalists and Grade 10 science students can answer questions like, "What will the winters be like in Kapuskasing twenty years from now if developing countries put five hundred million more cars on the road?"  If you're interested in reading summaries of work that's been done on human-friendly database query techniques, or if you have ideas you'd like to pass on, it's worth a surf.
