title: "Nature Network Pub Night Jan 26"

There's a pub night coming up! The theme of the evening is blogging. As usual, it's casual, but we've got a guest speaker, a report from the ScienceOnline09 conference, some science bloggers, and hopefully a hard copy of the new edition of Open Laboratory to browse through. The pub serves decent food, so come early and have dinner (and meet fellow Toronto Nature Networkers) before the talks start.

Have you ever thought that you'd like to start a blog, but wondered how to combine blogging with your work?

Toronto tech blogger (and "Accordion Guy") Joey DeVilla will give a talk about how he successfully incorporated blogging in his life and work.

We'll also look at the newest edition of Open Laboratory , a book collecting the best posts from science weblogs in the past year, and get a report from the ScienceOnline09 conference (held January 16-18 in North Carolina) to see some of the ways blogs are used in science.

Date: Monday January 26th 2009
Location: Fionn MacCool's (181 University at Adelaide)
Time: 6 PM onwards (talks start at 7)
Contact: Eva Amsen eva@easternblot.net
