I've updated the <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/past-projects">map</a> showing the birthplaces of people who've been involved in projects with me at U of T with data for (most of) this term's students. I picked up Bangladesh, Latvia, Peru (which adds South America to my collection of continents) and Poland.  I can hardly wait to find out if any of the students who haven't sent me data yet was born in Australia or Antarctica :-).
