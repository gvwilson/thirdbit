From Jon Erickson's <a href="http://www.ddj.com/linux-open-source/212700891">latest post</a>:
<blockquote>...in January 2009, <em>Dr. Dobb's Journal</em> is changing to <em>Dr. Dobb's Report</em> and will be delivered as a new monthly section in <em>InformationWeek</em> magazine... [this] means that <em>Dr. Dobb's</em> will be publishing and looking for more articles than ever before.</blockquote>
Well?  What are you waiting for---start writing, already.
