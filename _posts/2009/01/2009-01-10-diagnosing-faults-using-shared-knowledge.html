Neat idea from Microsoft Research called <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=78399 ">NetPrints</a>: "Basically, if a user has a working network configuration for an application or has determined how to rectify a problem, we would like this knowledge to be made available automatically to another user who is experiencing the same problem. NetPrints accomplishes this by applying decision tree based learning on working and non-working configuration snapshots and by using network traffic based problem signatures to index into configuration changes made by users to fix problems."
