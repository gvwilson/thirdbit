<a href="http://www.google.com/publicsector/">A small beginning</a>, but hopefully it will lead to bigger things:
<blockquote>Most people reach government and other public sector websites by using Google and other search engines. This site is a guide to the tools and best practices that can help you reach, communicate and engage with your community. Most of these tools are free, so they can also help you do more with less.</blockquote>
