As I said in a previous post, the students in my Government 2.0 consulting course are doing a treasure hunt this week: each student has to find and describe two existing Government 2.0 applications, and also two interesting data sets.  I'm collecting their findings on a <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/gov-20">new page</a> on this blog---your comments would be very welcome.
