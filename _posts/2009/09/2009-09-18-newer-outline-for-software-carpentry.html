I have updated the <a href="http://www.software-carpentry.org/capstone.html">description</a> of how I plan/hope to reorganize the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> course.  My thanks to everyone who commented on the earlier draft; I'd be very grateful for feedback on this one as well&mdash;I realize that some of the lectures are still hopelessly ambitious, but I hope it's at least a target to shoot at.  Please post comments on the <a href="http://softwarecarpentry.wordpress.com/2009/09/18/updated-outline-for-revised-course/">Software Carpentry blog post</a>.
