<a href="http://streetknit.ca">StreetKnit</a> has started its <a href="http://www.streetknit.ca/?p=79">2009 winter drive</a>, and you can help: drop off any handmade knitted socks, sweaters, toques, or what-not at one of their collection points, and they'll get it to someone in need.  Please help them make someone's winter a little warmer this year.
