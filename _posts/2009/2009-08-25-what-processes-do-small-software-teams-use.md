As a follow-up to our paper on software project portals, <a href="http://jordicabot.com/">Jordi Cabot</a> has started a <a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?biz.5.776203.10">discussion</a> at Joel on Software:
<blockquote>...the (small) teams building these portals do not use agile methodologies themselves, but instead rely on informal collections of best practices....I'd like to know if the same behaviour can be found among mISVs: Are any of you following a specific (agile) method  in the development of your products? Or it is more about improvising and working on what it seems best at any given time? (given the small size of the team, just 1 in many cases, and its expertise). Maybe not even agile methods are "agile" enough for this kind of teams?</blockquote>
The comments are interesting; lots here to chew on.
