We are very pleased to announce the release of Version 0.5 of Basie, a lightweight software project forge built on <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a> that borrows many ideas from <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org">Trac</a> and DrProject. As <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDQlaO1PTVw">this screencast</a> shows, its features include:
<ul>
	<li>Multiple projects per forge</li>
	<li>Role-based access control and pluggable user account management</li>
	<li>Subversion repository browser</li>
	<li>Cross-component search</li>
	<li>Per-project wiki with standard <a href="http://www.wikicreole.org/">WikiCreole</a> syntax</li>
	<li>A simple ticketing system</li>
	<li>Web-based administration</li>
	<li>REST API for web services</li>
	<li>Available in English, Bulgarian, Chinese, French, German, Hungarian, and Japanese</li>
	<li>Graphical dashboard showing project statistics and history (in beta)</li>
</ul>
Basie is still very much a work in progress (we picked "0.5" as a version number because we figure it's halfway done :-) ), but we are very pleased with how it's coming along, and invite anyone who is interested in trying it out, or helping with its development, to <a href="mailto:gvwilson@cs.utoronto.ca">get in touch</a>.
