I am very pleased to announce <a href="https://stanley.cs.utoronto.ca/csc49x/drproject/DrProject">the first release candidate for DrProject 1.1</a>.  We're very grateful for David Scannell [1] for dozens of improvements and bug fixes.  DrProject is a fork of <a href="http://trac.edgewall.com">Trac</a> with:
<ul>
	<li>support for multiple projects in a single installation;</li>
	<li>integrated mailing lists;</li>
	<li>tagging and tag clouds;</li>
	<li>a web-based administrative interface; and</li>
	<li>a scripting API.</li>
</ul>
It is being used in several courses at the <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a>, and at <a href="http://www.queensu.ca">Queen's University</a>; we hope you'll give it a try.

[1] A talented, conscientious, and likeable programmer who is now looking for a full-time job.
