<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/Visual_Studio_2020.asp">This piece</a>, from the Code Project, is titled "Visual Studio 2020", and purports to be about "…an even wilder Concept IDE".  I actually found it very conservative: in particular, there doesn't seem to be any provision for the code-under-development to tell the IDE what to do, or how to do it.  I think this is going to be a key feature—maybe <em>the</em> key feature—of <a href="http://www.acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=247&page=1">extensible programming systems</a>: developers will be able to say, "Show this when someone is debugging ClassFoo", or "Display these extra items when the user is editing anything that has member variables of type Fribble".  Most developers won't ever write things that do this themselves, just as most never write their own Apache plugins, but the few who do will make life a <em>lot</em> better for the rest of us.
