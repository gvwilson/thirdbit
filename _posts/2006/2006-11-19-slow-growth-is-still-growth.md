We discovered late last week that a team at <a href="http://www.tucowsinc.com/">TUCOWS</a> is using DrProject.  That got me wondering who else had downloaded it, so I trawled through some Apache server logs and came up with 56 distinct hosts in Canada, Japan, China, Taiwan, and the United States, including:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.uni-karlsruhe.de/">University of Karlsruhe</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.queensu.ca">Queen's University</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://jpl.nasa.gov">JPL</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.jefferson.edu">Thomas Jefferson University</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.pw.edu.pl">Warsaw Polytechnic</a></li>
</ul>
It ain't quite world conquest, but it's a start ;-)
