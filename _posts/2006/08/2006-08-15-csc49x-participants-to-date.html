As part of my ongoing battle with entropy, I'm trying to update and correct my list of who's taken part in CSC49X projects I've supervised.  The up-to-date list is now on a <a href="https://stanley.cs.utoronto.ca/csc49x/drproject/All/wiki/PastMembers">DrProject wiki page</a> on <a href="http://stanley.cs.toronto.edu">stanley</a> (the server that the <a href="http://www.jonahgroup.com">Jonah Group</a> kindly donated to us).  Please send updates or corrections to <a href="mailto:gvwilson@cs.utoronto.ca">me</a>.
