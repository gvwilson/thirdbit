Three of the most important things developers need to learn in order to succeed in the real world are <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/000292.html">how to run a meeting</a>, <a href="http://paulgraham.com/investors.html">how to give a presentation</a>, and <a href="http://onstartups.com/Home/tabid/3339/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/765/HowToWatchAStartupPresentation.aspx">how to give value when attending one</a>.  When I run the world, all three will be taught in a mandatory first-year course, along with basic time management skills.  And chocolate will be free, tasty, and good for you.
