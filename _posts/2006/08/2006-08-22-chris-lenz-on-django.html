<a href="http://www.cmlenz.net/">Chris Lenz</a> has been a major contributor to <a href="http://projects.edgewall.com/trac">Trac</a>, and spent a month working on <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a> for us earlier this year.  His <a href="http://www.cmlenz.net/blog/2006/08/the_python_web_.html">post</a> in the wake of <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/613.html">Guido's endorsement of Django</a> is a thoughtful look at the framework's strengths and weaknesses.
