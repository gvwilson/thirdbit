A <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~gvwilson/drproject-screencast.html">screencast</a> highlighting some of the features of the next release of <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a> is now available.  There wasn't room to include the nifty web-based administration features that Greg Lapouchnian built as his Google Summer of Code project, but they'll be covered in a separate 'cast Real Soon.  It's lookin' pretty cool...
