<a href="http://buildix.thoughtworks.com/">Buildix</a> (from <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a>) shows just how commoditized web-based project management tools have become.  It's basically Linux-on-a-CD with <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a>, <a href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net">CruiseControl</a>, <a href="http://projects.edgewall.com/trac">Trac</a>, and user management ready for use.

No sign of tagging, mailing lists, or a scripting interface, though, which are three features we considered must-haves for <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a>.  I wonder how hard it would be to package DrP this way?

<hr />(And for regular readers, I'm pleased to announce that Greg Lapouchnian has acquired the <a href="http://www.drproject.org">drproject.org</a> domain to host long-term development.  Thanks, GregL.
