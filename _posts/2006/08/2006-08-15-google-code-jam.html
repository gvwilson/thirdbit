Google's <a href="http://www.google.com/codejam">Code Jam</a> is a coding competition with $165,000 in prize money.  The schedule is:
<ul>
	<li>Qualification round: Tuesday, Sept 5</li>
	<li>Round 1 (1000 participants): Thursday, Sept 14</li>
	<li>Round 2 (500 participants): Tuesday, Sept 19</li>
	<li>Finals (in New York City, all expenses paid): Friday, Oct 27</li>
</ul>
Languages allowed: C++, Java, C#, VB.NET, and (for the first time) Python.

The catch? All submissions have a maximum of 2 seconds of runtime per test case, to prevent lazy solutions like exhaustive search.  This puts Python (even <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython">IronPython</a>) at a disadvantage, but since it's the #3 language at Google (behind C++ and Java), it's still in the mix.
