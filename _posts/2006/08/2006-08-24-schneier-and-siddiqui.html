Two articles that help put <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/613.html">squabbles over Python web programming frameworks</a> (and just about everything else) into perspective:
<ul>
	<li>Haroon Siddiqui's <a href="http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1155937810425&call_pageid=968256290204&col=Columnist969907621513">"The Muslim Malaise"</a>, from last weekend's star. The first couple of paragraphs almost made me throw it away; I'm glad I stuck with it to find what how a sensible, liberal, devout Muslim thinks is wrong with the world.</li>
	<li>Bruce Schneier's <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/08/what_the_terror.html">"What the Terrorists Want"</a>, which was originally published by Wired.com. As he points out, the aim of terrorism is not to kill people---it's to inspire terror.  By that measure, Western governments are doing exactly what the terrorists want.</li>
</ul>
