The third-bit.com server has gone down overnight Saturday for the last three weeks.  It's a rogue cron job of some kind, left over from our meddlings with mod_python or maybe the Tomcat installation.  Enter Nathan Harrington's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f_eU3huEG0">knockAge</a>, a piece of software that lets you control the computer by whacking it. I was reminded of Niven and Pournelle's novel <em>Inferno</em>, in which a science fiction writer finds himself in Dante's Hell, and discovers that sections have been set aside for sins that haven't yet been invented.  I wonder if "computer abuse" will be one of them...
