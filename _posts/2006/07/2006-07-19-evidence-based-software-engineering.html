The July'06 issue of <a href="http://www.computer.org/portal/site/software/"><em>IEEE Software</em></a> has an excellent article called "Agile Software Testing in a Large-Scale Project".  It presents data on what happens when you introduce some XP practices into a large software project; as the authors say, "...this is the most comprehensive data set from an actual project using agile quality practices that has published its results to date."  Very worth reading --- it's unfortunately not free, but you can <a href="http://csdl2.computer.org/persagen/DLAbsToc.jsp?resourcePath=/dl/mags/so/&toc=comp/mags/so/2006/04/s4toc.xml">buy a copy</a> online.  I've been sceptical of the claims made by XP's more outspoken advocates; it looks like I may have to admit I was wrong.
