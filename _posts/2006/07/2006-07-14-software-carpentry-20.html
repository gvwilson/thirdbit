I am pleased to announce the release of <a href="http://swc.scipy.org">Software Carpentry 2.0</a> (Final).  The <a href="http://swc.scipy.org">web site</a> is up, the <a href="https://www.swc.scipy.org/pipermail/announce/">mailing</a> <a href="https://www.swc.scipy.org/pipermail/dev/">lists</a> have been populated, all the <a href="http://projects.scipy.org/swc/report/1">tickets</a> have been moved into the project's <a href="http://projects.scipy.org/swc">Trac</a>, and I've submitted a proposal for a wrap-up talk to <a href="http://www.scipy.org/SciPy2006">SciPy'06</a>. It's taken 18 months to complete instead of the 10 I originally planned, but I have a green light to teach the course again this winter at the <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a>, and hope that others will pick the course up elsewhere.
