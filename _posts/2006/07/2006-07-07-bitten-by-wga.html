Earlier today, I discovered that Microsoft was making a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=334ad466-8b53-4440-8ff0-6ac8142d9198">threat analysis tool</a> available for free download. Great, says I: it might make a good teaching aid in my Software Architecture class, or in the security classes that others at <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca">U of T</a> are putting together.

Except that it requires .NET 2.0 to run...

...the installer for which needs Microsoft Windows Installer 3.0...

...which wants to put <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Genuine_Advantage">Windows Genuine Advantage</a> on my machine. WGA is a "phone home" program that checks whether your version of Windows is legit.  I have no problem with that, but I <em>do</em> have problems with not knowing what other information it's collecting (there's no pop-up displaying what it's about to send, with a "cancel" button), and with the possibility (which Microsoft has refused to deny) that WGA might disable my Windows installation (which, I hasten to add, was paid for when I bought this laptop from Gateway).

Kind of negates the warm fuzzy I got from their sponsorship of <a href="http://www.developwithoutborders.com/">Developers Without Borders</a> earlier... :-(
