"Each of your eyes transfers information to your brain at about the same speed as a fast Ethernet connection."  (as reported in this <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn9633">New Scientist article</a>).  That's about 8.75 megabits/sec (extrapolating from guinea pig data).  Our brains could handle more --- kind of funny to discover that even evolution leads to bandwidth-limited systems.
