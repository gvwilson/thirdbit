<a href="http://www.macworld.com/weblogs/macword/2006/07/rfp/index.php">This</a>, via <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~pgries">Paul Gries</a>, is interesting: some human editors of the book and magazine kind have put together a wishlist for an editor of the computer kind, and are hoping someone out there in programming land will build it for them.  It's much less formal than the design competition idea I tried in the original Software Carpentry project, but maybe that means it'll actually work...
