We are very pleased to announce the release of <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/drproject">DrProject 1.0</a>.  For those of you who aren't regular readers ;-), DrProject is a web-based software project management portal specifically tailored for classroom use.   Like its predecessor, <a href="http://projects.edgewall.com/trac">Trac</a>,  it integrates <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> with a wiki, a simple bug tracker, and milestones.  Unlike <a href="http://projects.edgewall.com/trac">Trac</a>, it supports multiple projects out of the box, relies on the underlying Unix system for authentication, and provides per-project mailing lists with whitelisting.  <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/drproject">DrProject</a> is already in use in classes at the <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a>, and is being trialed at other educational institutions.

We'd like to thank the <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a>, <a href="http://www.perforce.com">Perforce</a>, the <a href="http://www.jonahgroup.com">Jonah Group</a>, <a href="http://www.ibm.ca">IBM</a>, and the <a href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/">Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council</a> for their support.  We'd also like to thank everyone whose hard work made this release possible.  As they say: w00t!

(Please note: the 1.0 release is rather slow due to some "features" of the wiki-to-HTML converter.  These will be corrected for the 1.1 release, which we expect to make available in about four weeks.)
