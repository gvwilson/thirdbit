Anyone who's ever had to keep a couple of hundred machines running, and a couple of hundred users from melting down, knows just how hard it is to avoid thrashing.  Tom Limoncelli's book is a hard-knocks guide to avoiding or ignoring interruptions, building good habits (so that the right thing will happen even when you're frazzled), prioritization, and managing user expectations.

Thomas A. Limoncelli: <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/reading.html#limoncelli-time-management"><em>Time Management for System Administrators</em></a>.  O'Reilly, 2005, 0596007833.

(Maybe if I put Tom's ideas into practice, I'll have time to explore <a href="http://www.gridenvy.com">Javascript-based grid computing</a>, play with <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython">IronPython</a> (which is coming up on its 1.0 release), or learn how <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/drproject">DrProject</a> actually works.  Maybe.)
