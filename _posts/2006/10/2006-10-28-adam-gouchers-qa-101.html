<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/AdamGoucher">Adam Goucher</a> is the best tester I've ever worked with.  He is now teaching an introductory course in Toronto called "<a href="http://www.ninjatactics.com/qa/QA101/QA101.html">QA 101</a>", which includes discussion of how to automate routine setup and testing with Python.
