I don't bother with <a href="http://www.wired.com"><em>Wired</em></a> much any more, but this piece titled "<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/evote/1,71957-0.html">Build a Better Voting Machine</a>" is great.  Berkeley's David Wagner and Princeton's Ed Felten (who used to write computer chess programs, many years ago) have looked at what's wrong with today's machines, and described a better one.  I'm going to recommend it to my <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~csc407h">Software Architecture</a> class...
