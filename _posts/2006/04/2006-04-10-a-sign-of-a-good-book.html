One sign of a good book is that you keep finding new things in it.  A while back, I <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/000403.html">asked for help</a> in pulling content out of mailboxes with Python.  I should have checked my shelves before I posted: John Goerzen's Foundations of PYthon Network Programming, which I <a href="http://www.ddj.com/documents/s=9777/ddj0506p/0506p.html">reviewed</a>  for <a href="http://www.ddj.com">DDJ</a> last year, had an example that was easily tweaked to do exactly what I wanted. So, thanks, John---I appreciate the help ;-)
