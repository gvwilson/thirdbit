I forwarded a link to an article called <a href="http://grayproductions.net/ruby/first_steps.html">Unit Testers Get More Chicks</a> to some friends; one immediately replied, "Because of course, <a href="http://www.ddj.com/dept/architect/184415216">they're all guys</a>."  Ironically, I was complaining in the pub last night about the skewed gender representation at <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/000467.html">Demo</a> <a href="http://farm.tucows.com/blog/_archives/2006/4/26/1913333.html">Camp</a>. Oops.
