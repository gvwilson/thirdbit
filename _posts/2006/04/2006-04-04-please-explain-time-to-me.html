<p>Three years ago, Joel Spolsky wrote a brilliant little article that explained <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html">the bare minimum that every programmer should know about Unicode</a>.  Can someone please write an equivalent article on time, time zones, daylight savings time, leap seconds, and all that jazz?  Please?  I'll send you food...</p>
