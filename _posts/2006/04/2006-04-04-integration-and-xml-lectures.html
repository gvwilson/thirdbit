Hot on the heels of yesterday's lecture on <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/swc2/lec/integrate.html">integration</a> (which desperately needs iron-willed editing) comes a rewrite of the <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/swc2/lec/xml.html">XML lecture</a>.  This is a mix of HTML formatting rules and tags, and DOM; I'd appreciate knowing if you think it hangs together, and whether there needs to be more on how to process XML programmatically.
