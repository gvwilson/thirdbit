<p><a href="http://unleashedinformatics.com">Unleashed Informatics</a>, the spin-off successor to <a href="http://www.blueprint.org">Blueprint</a>, has <a href="http://unleashedinformatics.com/index.php?pg=news.announcements.060403">announced</a> that it is going to <a href="http://www.itbusiness.ca/it/client/en/home/News.asp?id=39023">enforce its patent</a> on a "system for electronically managing, finding, and/or displaying biomolecular interactions."  Three of my 49X projects were with Blueprint---we built testing infrastructure, a SOAP interface, and a graph search engine for their flagship biomolecular interaction database---and several worked for Blueprint at various times.  I'll be interested to see how broadly they try to apply their patent, and how much good it does them.</p>
