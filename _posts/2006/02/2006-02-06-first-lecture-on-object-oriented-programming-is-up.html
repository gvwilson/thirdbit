I've split the lecture on object-oriented programming in two; the <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/swc2/lec/oop01.html">first one</a> is now on the web (without diagrams).  This ties with the rewrite of the <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/swc2/lec/style.html">style lecture</a> for "most changes since the fall", so comments and corrections would be very welcome.

Eleven days 'til the AAAS workshop...
