<p>As many have observed, Flickr's <a href="http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days">interesting photos</a> page is addictive and beautiful.  It's also inspiring, when you realize that there's no difference between photos from Thailand and photos from Thunder Bay.</p>

<p>And of course, the same 'net that brings us pictures from around the world also lets us listen in on <a href="http://www.wirfs-brock.com/rebeccasblog.html">Rebecca Wirfs-Brock's occasional musings</a>.  If she isn't in your blog roll, she should be; I just wish that her <a href="http://www.computer.org">IEEE Computer</a> articles were appearing there, so that the post-print generation could appreciate them too.</p>
