<p>UPS messed up a delivery from the States again today.  (Apparently, they find it hard to remember that Canada is an independent country, with its own taxes and regulations and stuff.)  Having wasted hours wandering around their responsibility-avoidance systems last year, trying to sort out similar problems, I'd like to make a request: if you're a publisher sending me books to review, please, choose someone --- anyone --- else.</p>
