<p>Annoyed by people conducting 80-decibel conversations on their cellphones in public places?  Just wait---according to <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn8786">New Scientist</a>, Motorola is about to inflict guitar phones on the world.  Yes, you heard me: the cellphone display will show the fret board, and as the Santana wannabe next to you fingers it, the phone will play.</p>

<p>Sartre was wrong.  Hell isn't other people; it's other people's toys.</p>
