The <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/swc2/lec/oop02.html">second lecture on object-oriented programming</a> is now on the web.  This describes operator overloading and static methods, and includes the design patterns material that was in the old design lecture (which has been removed---the general consensus was that it didn't work).  As always, comments are welcome.
