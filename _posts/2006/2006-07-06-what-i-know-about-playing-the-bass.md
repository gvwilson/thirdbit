<a href="http://damian.conway.org/">Damian Conway</a> spoke here at U of T last night. He's very engaging, though I think I would have enjoyed the talk more if the examples had been shorter (and if there had been less Lara Croft at the beginning --- still not sure what that was all about).  The best part came right at the end, when he said (roughly), "One of the reasons I'm a good hacker is that I write code every single day." My first thought was the number of times I've told students to try to find balance in their life: play <a href="http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=2&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.upa.org%2F&ei=tE6tRLmRC4y6pwLlwOTrCQ&sig2=KbQ0dOKClhkHvg4pYKUBMg">Ultimate</a>, <a href="http://www.streetknit.ca">knit</a>, anything to avoid a one-note existence. But then I thought about what a jazz musician named Al Gorman once told me: you can learn how to play bass like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Paul_Jones_%28musician%29">John Paul Jones</a> or <a href="http://www.roncarter.net">Ron Carter</a> in six hours --- every day, for ten years. Nobody tells them to get a life; instead, society recognizes that if you want to be the best there is, you have to focus single-mindedly. When programmers do it, they're called geeks, but maybe that level of geekery is essential. (And maybe that's why I'll never be <a href="http://damian.conway.org/">Damian Conway</a>... ;-)
