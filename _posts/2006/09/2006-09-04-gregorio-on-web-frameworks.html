Joe Gregorio has a nice piece titled <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Why_so_many_Python_web_frameworks">"Why Are There So Many Python Web Frameworks?"</a>, during which he creates another one.  It's a nice intro to the ideas.  Meanwhile, the folks at <a href="http://www.openbc.com">openBC</a>, a commercial social networking site, have been running a <a href="http://opendesign.openbc.com/">design competition</a> for a new-look user page.  It's similar to what I tried to do six years ago with the original Software Carpentry project, except of course it's successful ;-).
