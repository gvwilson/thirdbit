The first TorCHI meeting of the academic year will be on Thursday, Sept 28, in Bahen 1230.  Khai Truong, a new professor in our department, will be talking about an audio-based reminder application.  For details, see the <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/107922/">upcoming.org announcement</a>.  I think this is a good chance for DemoCampers and other tech/entrepreneurial types in Toronto to meet and mingle with university types; look forward to seeing you there.
