<p>Discussion about Python 3000 is heating up.  What I haven't seen so far is a list of things that will be <em>dropped</em> from the language to make room for new ideas.  Back quotes?  Don't think anyone will miss those.  Tuples?  If the language acquires a generic way to 'const' an object, tuples (and frozen sets) could be dropped (they'd be const lists and const sets respectively, and we could even start using const dicts as dict keys).</p>

<p>What else?  What would you like to see removed from the language?</p>
