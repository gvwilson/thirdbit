The <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/swc2/lec/py04.html">fourth lecture</a> on Python for the <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/swc">Software Carpentry</a> course is now up.  It covers sets, dictionaries, and a little bit of algorithmic complexity.  Comments and criticisms are very welcome.

And if that's too serious for year, check out the web site for the <a href="http://www.waterfall2006.com/">Waterfall 2006</a> conference ;-).
