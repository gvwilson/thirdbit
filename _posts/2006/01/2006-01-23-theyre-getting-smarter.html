<p><a href="http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/archive-012006.html#00000784">This posting</a> from the folks at <a href="http://www.f-secure.com">F-Secure</a> compares the structure of the first PC virus, Boot/Brain.A (which recently celebrated its 20th birthday) with that of the more recent W32/Bagle.AG.  Coincidentally, <a href="http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/tbcan02/sr-tb2002_e.html">multi-drug resistant tuberculosis</a> is on the rise.  Having just reviewed Nancy Forbes' <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/000359.html">Imitation of Life: How Biology is Inspiring Computing</a>, I have to wonder: does the existence of anti-virus programs produce tougher computer viruses in the same way that more powerful drugs drive the evolution of real ones?</p>
