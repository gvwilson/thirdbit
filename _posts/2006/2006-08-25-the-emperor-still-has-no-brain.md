A <a href="http://www.skeptic.com/the_magazine/featured_articles/v12n02_AI_gone_awry.html">nice piece</a> by Peter Kassan in <a href="http://www.skeptic.com"><em>The Skeptic</em></a> about AI's ongoing failure to deliver.  He simplifies a bit, and there are counter-arguments, and no, I don't agree with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140145346">Roger Penrose</a> that quantum gravity and microtubules in the brain are somehow essential to intelligence (at least, that's what I think he was saying), but Kassan's main points are good ones.
