Michael Arrington, at <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com">TechCrunch</a>, has updated his year-old list of <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/25/a-year-later-the-companies-i-wanted-to-profile-but-didnt-exist/">companies he'd like to profile that didn't exist</a> at the time. His mojo must be stronger than mine: my <a href="http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/738.html">"Not on the Shelves"</a> articles have only ever led to a couple of books, but many of the companies he described so wistfully 12 months ago are now realities.
