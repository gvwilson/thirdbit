Could your business use some help with a design problem? Perhaps you are wrestling with space layout, storage problems, environmental analysis,  energy decisions, technology choices, websites or something along these  lines? For the course Engineering Strategies and Practices, 1,000  first-year students must tackle a team design project for a community  group, non-governmental organization, industry or a group within the  university. Many projects are required in order to keep the teams small  and individualized.

Please consider proposing a project, or passing this message on to someone who might need assistance. Serving as a project client only  requires six hours of your time over the winter term, but the effects on  the students will last their lifetimes. Work begins early in the new  year, so please respond promptly.

For more information or to register a project, please contact <a href="mailto:p.anderson@utoronto.ca">Phil Anderson</a> or check out the Project Clients section of the <a href="http://www.ecf.utoronto.ca/~apsesp/">ESP website</a>.
