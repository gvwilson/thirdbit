<p>OK, I'm a little late hearing about this, but: there's a company in the States called <a href="http://www.sea-code.com/">SeaCode</a> that thinks it's figured out how to get the cost-effectiveness of offshore programming without the management hassles of an eight-hour time difference.  Their solution?  Stick a bunch of programmers on a boat, and anchor it just outside the international line due west of Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>Gives a whole new meaning to the phrase "software piracy", doesn't it? ;-)</p>
