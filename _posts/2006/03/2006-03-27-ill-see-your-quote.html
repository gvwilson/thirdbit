<p><a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/03/27.html#a1414">This article</a>, from Jon Udell, describes how he used online services to <a href="http://www.wayfaring.com/maps/show/11786">highlight</a> a section of trail that he'd cleared of trash.  He sent the map, along with a letter, to his local newspaper, to encourage others to pick up where he left off.  Things like this make me wonder whether online connectivity will, in the long run, favor the civic-minded: people who don't care about things like this won't be affected much one way or the other (they'll just continue to consume), but people who <em>do</em> will be able to make ties with each other more easily.  Mumble mumble preferential evolution mumble game theory mumble...</p>

<p>Udell closes with a quote from Gibson: "The future is here, it's just unevenly distributed."  I think another would be just as appropriate: "The street (in this case, the hiking trail) finds its own uses for things."</p>
