<p><a href="http://www.newscientist.com">New Scientist</a> is featuring a story from Denmark that <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=mg18925444.200">the appearance of photosynthetic life may have led to the formation of continents</a> (or at least aided it).  Sadly, two of the three Google Ads that came up when I viewed the page were selling creationist literature...</p>
