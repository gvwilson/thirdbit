All the outstanding minor corrections to the Software Carpentry notes have now been made; there are still 21 diagrams outstanding, but they should be in by Sunday.  My thanks to everyone who provided feedback—especially <a href="http://www.ninjatactics.com">Adam Goucher</a> and his very sharp eyes.
