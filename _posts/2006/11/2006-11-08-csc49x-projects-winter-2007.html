Week 9: time to start thinking about next term's projects.  Here's what's on the table:
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="https://stanley.cs.utoronto.ca/csc49x/drproject/olm">Online Marking</a> tool, which gives TAs the ability to mark up student code on the web.  This is now being used in a couple of courses, and there was lots of interest at DemoCamp in modifying it to work as a general online code review tool.  <a href="https://stanley.cs.utoronto.ca/csc49x/drproject/olm/wiki/LillianAngel">Lillian Angel</a> will be heading up the team, under the direction of <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~campbell">Jennifer Campbell</a>; two more bodies are needed.</li>
	<li>Our <a href="https://stanley.cs.utoronto.ca/csc49x/drproject/BB_Stats">Blackboard Plugin</a> project, which displays stats on the grades being given in different sections of large courses.  This plugin may be done by Christmas, but there are lots more to write---Java, anyone?</li>
	<li>The <a href="https://stanley.cs.utoronto.ca/csc49x/drproject/MailClouds">MailClouds</a> project is using tag clouds to show the history of conversations between businesses and their customers.</li>
	<li>We're also <a href="https://stanley.cs.utoronto.ca/csc49x/drproject/TreeViz">visualizing generalogical data</a> for <a href="http://www.reed.utoronto.ca/index.html">REED</a>, the Records of Early English Drama project, using Flash, asynchronous XML, and other sexy technologies.  Rich web GUIs... mmm...</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mylar/">Mylar</a> is a tool that (among other things) allows <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> to connect directly to issue-tracking systems.  There is apparently already a <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Mylar_Trac_Connector">plugin</a> for <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org">Trac</a>;we'd like to adapt it for <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a>.</li>
	<li>One new project: improving the GUI of a tool for visualizing brain scan data.  Prof. <a href="http://medbio.utoronto.ca/faculty/strother.html">Stephen Strother</a>'s team at the Rotman-Baycrest is studying the effects of strokes and other impairments on elderly patients; they have lots of data, and need better ways to look at it.</li>
	<li>Another new project: an API (with implementations) for an abstract spreadsheet connection layer that does for Excel, Gnumeric, and OpenOffice what ODBC, JDBC, and Python's DB-API do for databases.</li>
</ul>
If you have at least two 300-level CS courses, and your GPA is 3.0 or higher, please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@cs.utoronto.ca">give me a shout</a>.
