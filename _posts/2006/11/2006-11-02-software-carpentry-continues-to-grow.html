Traffic on the <a href="http://swc.scipy.org">Software Carpentry</a> site was up again in October, after a dip in September:

The sys admin at <a href="http://www.enthought.com">Enthought</a> also cleaned the comment spam out of the <a href="http://projects.scipy.org/swc">Trac</a> they gave me to manage the project.  I have two dozen more minor tickets to file from email I've received in the last few weeks (much of it from Germany).  Still waiting for people to start contributing content --- any volunteers?
