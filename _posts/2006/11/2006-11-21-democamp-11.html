A <a href="http://www.rohanjayasekera.com/blog/2006/11/democamptoronto11.html">handful</a> of <a href="http://www.storyofastartup.com/?p=30">early</a> <a href="http://martin.cleaver.org/blog/2006/11/21/democamptoronto11-open-to-any/">bloggers</a> are calling <a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCampToronto11">DemoCamp 11</a> a "failure".  I'm not sure why: I thought it had more interesting content than 9 and 10.  The lead-off, <a href="http://autossl.com/joomla/">AutoSSL</a>, was an interesting idea (auto-provision of SSL certificates to small devices in the home, like security cameras); there was too much slideware, and some technical problems, but I think we should start being more open-minded about the former, and they handled the latter with aplomb.

Andrew Reynolds demo'd <a href="http://www.openqa.org/selenium/">Selenium</a> next. It's a very cool tool for testing web applications via the browser; he didn't build it, but again, I think we'd do well to be open-minded about that --- I'd certainly welcome more people standing up to say, "I found this really cool thing that made my life a zillion times easier, and you oughta know about it."

The <a href="http://meatballsociety.org/cgi-bin/design">Design Bibliography</a> wiki had nice tabs ;-), and Sunir motivated it well; I agree with other commentators that it's a very crowded space, but that doesn't mean there isn't room for new ideas.  <a href="http://www.theartguy.com/">My Studio Assistant</a> was a prototype of a CMS for <em>really </em>nontechnical people; its creator wants to put together a team to build it, and market it to artists, craftspeople, galleries, and so on.  The only one that left me dissatisfied was <a href="http://www.firestoker.com/">Firestoker</a>; after waiting a year for their demo, I'm still not sure what it actually is.

So overall, I'd give it three and a half stars out of five.  About a third of the audience was newcomers (which is good), and the discussion in the pub afterward was worth staying out on a cold November evening for.  I look forward to January's...
