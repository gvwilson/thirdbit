Toronto's first <a href="http://www.usabilitycamp.org">Usability Camp</a> will be held on Tuesday, Nov 14.  From the <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/123194/">announcement</a>:

UsabilityCamp is based on the same "unconference" format as DemoCamp and CaseCamp but focused on usability &ndash; and it's FREE! We want to bring the product & industrial design, technology, web and business communities together and engage YOU in conversation about design, usability and user experience.

This is all happening as part of World Usability Day &ndash; local activities on a global scale which all take place on November 14th, 2006.

The theme for our Toronto event is Canadian innovation and our featured presenters include innovators from Umbra, Sapient Canada, Autodesk, ConceptShare and the Habitat New Media Lab of the Canadian Film Centre.
