Last night's <a href="http://barcamp.org/TorCampDemoCamp6">DemoCamp 6</a> was a little bumpier than usual: the organizer, <a href="http://davidcrow.ca/">David Crow</a>, was unwell, so <a href="http://www.radiantcore.com/">Joey</a> and <a href="http://www.radiantcore.com/">Jay</a> stepped in as MCs, and then the A/V system went <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000">HAL</a> on us.  Nevertheless, the demos were very entertaining:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.tucows.com">Ross Rader</a> of TUCOWS presented <a href="http://start.tucows.com/">Skydasher</a>, their new AJAX-y home page system</li>
  <li><a href="http://queens.db.toronto.edu/~nilesh/">Nilesh Bansal</a>, from <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca">U of T</a>, showed a correlation-aware blog search engine called <a href="http://queens.db.toronto.edu/project/blogs/">Blogscope</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.thewehners.net/joshua/">Joshua Wehner</a> showed off a <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Rails</a> application for coordinating conference attendance.</li>
  <li><a href="http://honeybrown.ca/">Anand Agarawala</a> (also from <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca">U of T</a>) closed the session with <a href="http://honeybrown.ca/Pubs/BumpTop.html">BumpTop</a>, which applies the Unreal Tournament physics engine to the desktop.</li>
</ul>
They were all very cool, and once again made me feel that at some point, without really noticing, I became one of those "Fortran on a VAX is all you need" dinosaurs I remember from my first couple of jobs in the 1980s... ;-)
