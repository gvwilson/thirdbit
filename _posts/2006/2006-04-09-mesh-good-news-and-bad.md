The good news is the speaker lineup at the upcoming <a href="http://www.meshconference.com/">Mesh</a> conference in Toronto.  The bad news?  Only <a href="http://workerbeesblog.blogspot.com/2006/04/i-guess-mesh-follows-oreilly-10-rule.html">6 out of 50</a> are women.  As <a href="http://www.insanecats.com">Michelle Levesque</a> and I observed two years ago, despite the frequency with which our community talks about "rights", we have a lousy track record when it comes to addressing---hell, even discussing---the fact that we're still a boy's club.
