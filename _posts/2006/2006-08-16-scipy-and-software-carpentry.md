I'm flying down to <a href="http://www.caltech.edu">CalTech</a> this evening to give a talk on <a href="http://www.swc.scipy.org">Software Carpentry</a> at <a href="http://www.scipy.org/SciPy2006">SciPy'06</a>.  There's been a fair bit of traffic on the web site in the last couple of weeks, and I'm looking forward to hearing how else we can help scientists and engineers become more productive programmers.
