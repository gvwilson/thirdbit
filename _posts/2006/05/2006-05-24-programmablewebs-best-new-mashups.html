The term "mashup" is sooooo Web 2.0 *yawn*, but <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>'s "<a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/?p=312">Best New Mashups</a>" has some interesting links.  I particularly liked <a href="http://www.relate-a-zon.com/">Relate-a-zon</a>, but I am <em>not</em> going to take it seriously.  Not until I'm done marking, anyway.  Well, maybe if I played just a little now, I'd be able to focus better...
