<p>I know a fair bit about GNU Make, but this one has me stymied.  The Makefile that rebuilds the Software Carpentry course notes contains the following definitions:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
GFX_SUFFIX := gif jpg png
GFX_SRC := \
    $(foreach fmt,$(GFX_SUFFIX),\
      $(wildcard ./img/*.${fmt}) \
      $(wildcard ./lec/img/*/*.${fmt}) \
      $(foreach sitedir,${SITES}, \
        $(wildcard ./sites/${sitedir}/img/*.${fmt}) \
      ) \
    )
GFX_WEB := $(subst ./,./web/,${GFX_SRC})
</pre></blockquote>

<p>On all of the Linux and Windows (with Cygwin) machines I've used to date, this does the right thing: <code>GFX_SRC</code> is a list of all the image files in <code>./img</code> and <code>./lec/img/*</code>, and <code>GFX_WEB</code> has the same entries with <code>./web</code> prefixed to them.  (The <code>SITES</code> variable is empty, because I'm not building any site-specific content.)</p>

<p>But on my new Windows laptop (again with Cygwin), something goes wrong: Make misses two of the files in the <code>lec/img/oop01</code> direcctory, and tries to copy one file from the <code>lec/img/oop02</code> directory twice: once under <code>lec/img/oop02</code>, and once (incorrectly) under <code>lec/img/oop01</code>.  Since this doesn't exist, Make reports an error and halts.</p>

<p>I've checked versions, and all five machines are using GNU Make 3.80.  Is this a bug in Make?  In the way I'm defining my variables?  If so, why is it only triggered on the one box?</p>
