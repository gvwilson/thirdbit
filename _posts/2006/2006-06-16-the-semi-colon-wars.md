Brian Hayes' latest article for <a href="http://www.americanscientist.org"><em>American Scientist</em></a>, "<a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/AssetDetail/assetid/51982">The Semi-Colon Wars</a>", is a readable little survey of pointless holy wars in computing: semi-colons vs. parentheses, big-endian vs. little-endian, and more besides.  It's fun, and his programming language genealogy chart is very pretty.
