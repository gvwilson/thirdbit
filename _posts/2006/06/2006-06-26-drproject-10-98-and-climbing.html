We're edging up on <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/drproject">DrProject</a> 1.0's first release candidate --- <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/drproject/drproject-dev/milestone/Krypton">98%</a> of our tickets are closed.  If all goes well tomorrow and Wednesday, it should be available for trial on June 30, with the "real" release following a week or two later (depending on feedback).  We still have performance problems to solve, and a couple of bug fixes that we aren't going to merge into this release (too hard to unit test, and therefore too likely to destabilize the release), but I'm pleased --- very pleased.
