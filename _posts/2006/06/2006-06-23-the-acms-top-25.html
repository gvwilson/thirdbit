Between October 2005 and January 2006, the ACM polled its professional members, asking them to nominate and then vote for books they considered classics.  The final list is:
<ol>
	<li>The Elements of Programming Style</li>
	<li>Classics in Software Engineering</li>
	<li>Theory of Parsing, Translation and Compiling</li>
	<li>Pascal User Manual and Report</li>
	<li>Computer and the Brain</li>
	<li>Selected Writings on Computing</li>
	<li>Smalltalk-80: The Language and Its Implementation</li>
	<li>Compiler Construction</li>
	<li>The Relational Model for Database Management: Version 2</li>
	<li>A Programming Language</li>
	<li>Formal Languages and Their Relation to Automata</li>
	<li>Writing Efficient Programs</li>
	<li>Computation: Finite and Infinite Machines</li>
	<li>The Multics System</li>
	<li>Operating System Principles</li>
	<li>IBM System/360 Principles of Operation</li>
	<li>Mindstorms</li>
	<li>The Architecture of Concurrent Programs</li>
	<li>Structured Programming</li>
