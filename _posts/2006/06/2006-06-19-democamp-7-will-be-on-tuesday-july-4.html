<a href="http://barcamp.org/TorCampDemoCamp7">DemoCamp7</a> will be held on Tuesday, July 4, rather than June 27.  The venue has yet to be determined, but Perl hacker extraordinaire <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~damian/">Damian Conway</a> will be there.  Damian will also be speaking in Room 1180 of U of T's <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=40+St+George+St,+Toronto,+ON,+Canada&ie=UTF8&ll=43.660483,-79.39682&spn=0.006303,0.020814&om=1">Bahen Centre for Information Technology</a> the following evening (July 5) starting at 6:30 p.m.  Hope to see a good turnout at both!
