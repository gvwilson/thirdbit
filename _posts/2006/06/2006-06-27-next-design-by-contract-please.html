I was pleasantly surprised a few years ago when programmers (particularly open source programmers) actually started writing unit tests.  <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org">XP</a> is usually given the lion's share of the credit, but I think that <a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a> was the real reason: it was just enough structure to get people in, and had a perfect balance between simplicity and extensibility.

What I'd like to see catch on next is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract">design by contract</a>. Most people who've encountered it think it's about enforcing modularity, or about making sure that derived classes respect the rules of their parents.  What I like, though, is its temporal application: making sure that Version 3.1.2 of a class has the same externally-visible behavior as Version 3.1.1, so that upgrading is guaranteed not to break things.  I'd particularly like this <em>right now</em>, as we're banging our heads once more against  "slight" differences between successive versions of what's supposed to be the same damn library. The release notes for 3.1.2 of---let's call it "Fred", shall we?---don't mention any backward-incompatible changes, but somewhere eight levels down in the call stack, something is passing an Element where it should be passing a string, and everything after that is blowing up.

Given pre- and post-conditions (a big given, I'll grant you), a tool that checks an RPM, JAR file, or Egg against an existing installation, and reports discrepancies, shouldn't be all that hard to build---the general problem may be undecidable, but even something conservative, that draws human attention to possibly problematic mutations, would go a long way toward making lives like mine a little better.
