	<li><a href="http://bit-player.org/2006/scheduled-procrastination">Brian Hayes</a> on "<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.DS/0606067">Scheduling Algorithms for Procrastinators</a>" (with a side reference to "<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9912202">The Effects of Moore's Law and Slacking on Large Computations</a>").</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.solutionwatch.com/454/take-a-stand-with-standpedia/">Standpedia</a>, a collaborative site for building a "social encyclopedia of belief".  Basically, you can submit a question or belief, with some support, and then other people can agree or disagree. (via <a href="http://www.solutionwatch.com/">SolutionWatch</a>)</li>
	<li>Yet another <a href="http://imagine-it.org/amazong/vissimweb.htm">similarity web visualization</a> for <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>, this one using Flash. (via <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a>)</li>
	<li>And one non-link: I received a royalty statement yesterday from <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/">MIT Press</a> for my book <em><a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=8185">Practical Parallel Programming</a></em>.  Seven copies sold in 2005 --- I'd be very curious to find out who bought them...</li>
