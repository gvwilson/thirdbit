Pat Smith and Greg Lapouchnian (both former 49X project students) have written a two-part article on the Spring framework for <a href="http://www.redhat.com/magazine/"><em>Red Hat Magazine</em></a>.  The <a href="http://www.redhat.com/magazine/020jun06/features/spring/">first part</a> is now up on the web---congrats, guys.
