C'mon, folks, we're still only in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/new-releases/books/3839/ref=pd_nr_c_th_more/103-0215906-4907002?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=auto-left-1&pf_rd_r=0CSP7SYY1B59JQ4BTV9J&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=265699001&pf_rd_i=3839">number three spot</a> for new programming books on Amazon, behind books on Photoshop and ActionScript.  Remember, all the royalties go to a good cause, so by bumping us up to #1, you're helping to make the world a better place ;-)
