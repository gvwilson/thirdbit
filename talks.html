<h2><a href="{{site.github.url}}/lesson-design/">How to Design an Effective Lesson</a></h2>

<p>
  Having tried to cram a dozen books about teaching into
  a <a href="{{site.github.url}}/teaching/">two-day course</a>,
  I have now tried to cram key ideas from that course about
  designing effective lessons into this one-hour talk.

<h2><a href="{{site.github.url}}/greatest-hits/">Software Engineering's Greatest Hits</a></h2>

<p>
  Software engineering is in the process of turning itself into an
  evidence-based research discipline.  This talk describes how that is
  happening, why it matters, and a few of the more interesting,
  surprising, and controversial results to date.

<h2><a href="{{site.github.url}}/lessons-learned/">Software Carpentry: Lessons Learned</a></h2>

<p>
  Since its start in 1998, Software Carpentry has evolved from a
  week-long training course at the US national laboratories into a
  worldwide volunteer effort to improve researchers' computing
  skills. This talk will explore the lessons we've learned along the
  way about applying open source software development techniques to
  teaching at scale, and about getting people and institutions to
  change the way they work.

<h2><a href="{{site.github.url}}/not-in-the-calendar/">Not in the Calendar</a></h2>

<p>
  Hundreds of books about writing compilers are currently on the
  market, but there are only three about writing debuggers.  Everyone
  thinks we should teach children how to program, but undergraduate
  courses on computing education are practically nonexistent.  This
  talk explores what these gaps and others in undergraduate Computer
  Science courses tell us about the state of computing today, and
  about how we could fix it.
