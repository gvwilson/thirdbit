<!-- content --><p>The online portion of our work with learners at the <a href="http://www.stsci.edu">Space Telescope Science Institute</a> wound up today. 6 of the 14 people who took part in the on-site workshop submitted "graduation exercise" videos, and three more sent apologies (time pressure, technical difficulties, etc.), which I think is a pretty good completion rate. As always, we finished up by asking everyone to give us one good and one bad thing about the class:</p>
<table class="centered">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Good</strong></td>
<td><strong>Bad</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<ul>
<li>Test-driven development</li>
<li>Got some experience teaching in a new setting (from my on-site helper)</li>
<li>Exercises incorporated a lot of ideas (saw things in context)</li>
<li>Liked emphasis on "philosophical" parts: how to share work with colleagues, etc.</li>
<li>Liked the way the exercises were structured (e.g., the hints)</li>
<li>Useful to see how instructor worked through a problem from scratch</li>
<li>Changed the way I think about coding</li>
<li>Now breaking code into smaller chunks</li>
<li>Course has made me more aware of <em>how</em> I program</li>
<li>Now believe that good code should not need to be commented</li>
<li>The stuff on SVN was very useful</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td valign="top">
<ul>
<li>Needed to take personal time to do class</li>
<li>Disappointed by the narrowness of topics</li>
<li>Frustrated trying to get started (didn't have relevant background)</li>
<li>Course repeated a lot of things I'd seen before</li>
<li>N-body problem exercise was a biiiig jump</li>
<li>Would have liked assignments earlier</li>
<li>Time set for this meeting was inconvenient</li>
<li>Wanted more tips and tricks, psychology of programming, etc.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Some of the apparent contradictions in the "Bad" column reflect the diversity of learners' backgrounds; once again, I think this was the biggest challenge we faced. Overall, though, it was an interesting contrast to my experience running a class through <a href="http://p2pu.org">P2PU</a>. I've taught the <em>content</em> of Software Carpentry dozens of times over 14 years, so I had something immediate to draw on for the folks at STScI. On the other hand, I've never completed a course online myself, so I didn't have relevant personal experience to bring to bear at P2PU. I hope that by engaging local helpers in future bootcamp follow-ups, we'll help to grow a pool of people who can do that kind of teaching better.</p><!-- /content -->
