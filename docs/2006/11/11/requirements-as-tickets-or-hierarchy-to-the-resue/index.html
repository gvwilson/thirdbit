<!-- content --><p>Several of the small companies we&rsquo;ve spoken to recently have asked whether it would make sense to use an issue tracker to manage requirements.  It&rsquo;s superficially sensible: if you can create tickets for feature requests, why not create them for the needs that drive those features?</p>
<p>After pondering this for a (short) while, we think it&rsquo;s workable, but with caveats.  The first is that stakeholders must be able to express relationships between tickets, such as &ldquo;Feature X is needed to satisfy business need Y&rdquo;, &ldquo;P is an exception to the general rule Q,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;E must be done before F and G, which in turn must both be done before H can be started&rdquo;.  Injecting these cross-references must be really, really easy: stakeholders cannot be required to type in lots of ticket numbers (they might be willing to do this once, but they won&rsquo;t keep them all up to date as tickets are split, merged, added, and removed during the course of the project).</p>
<p>The second caveat is that the system must give stakeholders a way to organize the tickets into a sensible linear order.  Hypertext is all very well, but wandering around a twisty maze of little requirements is <em>not</em> an effective way to understand a complex system.  Linearization gives people who already know the problem architecture a way to help people who don&rsquo;t, learn.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still thinking about the first (tag-directed proximitization in an unstructured graph plus link-drawing?), but we have an idea for the second.  Right now, most ticketing systems&rsquo; standard display is a flat list sorted by ticket ID, filing date, priority, or something of that ilk (Figure 1).</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 1" src="../../../../files/2006/11/tickets.png" class="centered"></p>
<p>What if stakeholders had another view, in which they could organize tickets like this:</p>
<table class="centered">
<tr>
<td colspan="3"><strong>Tagging System</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> </td>
<td colspan="2">281: In-place editing</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> </td>
<td> </td>
<td>407: Keyword completion</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> </td>
<td> </td>
<td>399: Explicit "submit"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> </td>
<td colspan="2">117: Colorization</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> </td>
<td> </td>
<td>145: Red-purple-blue spectrum</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> </td>
<td> </td>
<td>214: Must be legible when printed B&W</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>A little AJAX ought to be enough to let users move things up and down, drag them left and right, or create a heading that isn&rsquo;t associated with an actual ticket.  The system would store this structure as a first-class entity; tickets that hadn&rsquo;t yet been manually organized wouldn&rsquo;t appear in it, while tickets that had been closed would be crossed out until a human being said, &ldquo;Yeah, take it out of the hierarchy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this would be a sensible way to organize issue tickets (which often relate to several components of the system).  I think it has more of a chance of working with requirements; I&rsquo;d be interested in hearing what you think.</p><!-- /content -->
