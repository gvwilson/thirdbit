<!-- content --><p>DemoCamp 9, held two days ago, was the first that has disappointed me.  Disappointment #1 was the demos themselves: <a href="http://conceptshare.com/">ConceptShare</a>&rsquo;s was great—I really want a chance to play with their stuff—and <a href="http://dictabrain.com/">DictaBrain</a>&rsquo;s voicemail-to-text was intriguing until we learned that the transcription is going to be done by typists in India, rather than software, but the <a href="http://www.theemailcompany.com/formulate.html">eMail Company&rsquo;s form builder</a> looked very 1999, and I&rsquo;m not sure even now what the point of the <a href="http://www.infoq.com">InfoQ</a> and <a href="http://pursudo.com/">Pursudo</a> demos were: the guy who demo&rsquo;d the first seemed to be trying to persuade us that yes, there really was some technical innovation in the site (I didn&rsquo;t see it), while the second was something thrown together in three days just so its authors could demo it.</p>
<p>If that was as far as the letdown went, I&rsquo;d be OK: I used to play a little jazz, and I know that open mike nights are always a mixed bag.  But as David Crow has very courageously said in his <a href="http://davidcrow.ca/article/1263/an-open-apology">latest post</a>, that isn&rsquo;t all that went wrong.  <a href="http://www.conceptshare.com">ConceptShare</a> is intended to help people collaborate on graphic design over the web; it lets you post images (such as advertising copy or screenshots of a new GUI), then annotate them and draw on them asynchronously, with all the logging and blogging you&rsquo;d expect.  During their demo, its creators used an image of a busty young woman in a low-cut dress taken from (I believe) a perfume ad.  One of the guys standing behind my table made a couple of locker room comments about her breasts while the image was on screen, and another couple of guys near him laughed.  They probably didn&rsquo;t notice the looks on the faces of the women at my table, but I did.  As the one who had invited those three women to attend, I felt embarrassed, and ashamed, and more than a little bit angry.
And then the <a href="http://pursudo.com">Pursudo</a> guys started their presentation with, &ldquo;The purpose of our software is get someone in this room laid,&rdquo; or something very similar.  I looked around at all the white male faces (at least 90% white, in a tech gathering, in Toronto—when&rsquo;s the last time you saw <em>that</em>?): some were grinning, and the rest were carefully neutral, because let&rsquo;s face it: nobody wants to be the prissy politically correct spoilsport who says, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re making people feel uncomfortable.&rdquo;
Two of the students who came with me have since said that they won&rsquo;t return.  I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s because the demos were a letdown; I think it was the boy&rsquo;s club atmosphere.  As I said a couple of weeks ago, I think that fixing this ought to be <em>the</em> goal of future Web 2.0 gatherings (and others).  We&rsquo;ll all be better for it.</p><!-- /content -->
