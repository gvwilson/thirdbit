<!-- content --><p>I have bits and pieces of several overlapping technical books right now,
but can&rsquo;t decide which if any to complete:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Building Software Together</em>
    is advice for undergraduates working on their first team project
    (either in school or in industry).
    It&rsquo;s the furthest along,
    but it&rsquo;s been a few years since I was working with undergrads in large numbers
    so I suspect some of my advice is out of date and out of touch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Data Science for Software Engineers</em>
    is an introduction to data analysis
    that (a) spends as much time on the messy business of getting, cleaning, and presenting data
    as it does on statistics
    and (b) uses software engineering data for all its examples.
    This one is more interesting to me personally,
    but it would be a lot of work to complete,
    and based on the polite disinterest I&rsquo;ve received
    every time I&rsquo;ve tried to get support for it,
    I suspect the audience is smaller than I&rsquo;d like it to be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Designing Research Software</em>
    is simultaneously
    a continuation of <em><a href="../../../../py-rse/">Research Software Engineering with Python</a></em>,
    a book-length expansion of &ldquo;<a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009809">Twelve quick tips for software design</a>&rdquo;,
    and a re-imagining of <em><a href="https://third-bit.com/sdxjs/index.html">Software Design by Example</a></em>
    (formerly <em>Software Tools in JavaScript</em>).
    Each chapter designs, constructs, and critiques
    a small version of something a research software engineer might actually build:
    a discrete particle simulator that illustrates the principles of object-oriented design,
    a file manager for large datasets that does error handling properly,
    a pipeline framework that records provenance in a reproducible way,
    and so on.
    Again,
    it&rsquo;s interesting to me personally,
    but I suspect the audience is small.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Software Engineering: A Compassionate, Evidence-Based Approach</em>
    is the undergraduate software engineering textbook I think our profession needs today.
    Its starting points are
    (a) students should be introduced to
    <a href="https://neverworkintheory.org/">the scientific study of programs, programmers, and programming</a>
    and (b) now that we know how much harm software can do,
    we should teach prevention and remediation up front,
    just like the best civil and chemical engineering departments do.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The &ldquo;which&rdquo; part of my quandary is just my usual dithering;
the &ldquo;if any&rdquo; goes a little deeper.
Sales of technical books have been dropping steadily for twenty years:
even ones as good as <em><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/the-programmers-brain">The Programmer&rsquo;s Brain</a></em> or <em><a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a></em>
struggle to get through the noise.
Textbooks have fared even worse,
and not just because of publishers&rsquo; jam-today starve-tomorrow pricing models.
I don&rsquo;t think any book I could write today
will ever reach as many people as <em><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/beautiful-code/9780596510046/">Beautiful Code</a></em> did 15 years ago.
Maybe that shouldn&rsquo;t matter to me, but it does.</p>
<p>And going even deeper,
the two books I&rsquo;m proudest of are two you&rsquo;ve never read:
<em>Three Sensible Adventures</em> and <em>Bottle of Light</em>.
I wrote the stories in the first for my niece;
it&rsquo;s now out of print,
but I have framed copies of the artwork up on the wall in my office
and they&rsquo;ve gotten me through some pretty bleak moments.
The second,
a middle-grade story about a world without light,
is only available through one of Scholastic&rsquo;s in-school programs for reluctant readers:
I&rsquo;ve tried periodically to buy back the rights,
but so far the answer has always been &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed writing both of them.
If I could do anything with the years I have left
I&rsquo;d write more stories like the ones I loved growing up.
I&rsquo;d like to introduce you all to a cloudherd named Noxy
(short for &ldquo;Noxious Aftertaste&rdquo;:
the children in her village are given unpleasant names
in order to discourage dragons from nibbling on them).
I&rsquo;d like you to meet a bookster&rsquo;s apprentice named Erileine,
a giant robotic dinosaur who may or may not be the original Santa Claus,
and an orphaned clone with an odd knack for mechanical things
trying to make ends meet in a post-Crunch Antarctica.</p>
<p>But all I&rsquo;ve done in the last ten years is accumulate rejections,
which makes it hard to keep writing.
(And yes,
I know about authors who got some-large-number of rejections
before making a breakthrough sale,
but I also know people who&rsquo;ve won the lottery…)
I know I should pick one of the above and get it over the line,
but on a colder-than-spring-should-be Saturday morning,
it&rsquo;s all too easy to spend half an hour writing a blog post.</p>
<p>Family&rsquo;s awake; time to make tea.
Be well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Later: the book I&rsquo;d <em>actually</em> like to write is
<em><a href="../../../../ideas/#what-i-would-write-if-i-was-smarter-than-i-am">Sex and Drugs and Guns and Code</a></em>,
but I still don&rsquo;t know enough
and I&rsquo;m not a good enough writer.
<em>Building Software Together</em> and the software engineering textbook in the #4 spot above
are partly attempts to smuggle some of those ideas
past the defenses that people like my younger self have erected
to protect themselves from feeling uncomfortable about themselves;
one of the reasons I set <em>BST</em> aside
was the realization that I&rsquo;m not stealthy enough to pull it off.</p>
