<!-- content --><p>I&rsquo;ve been blogging recently about teaching tools I want,
such as <a href="../../../../2022/12/04/i-want-a-memory-diagram-generator/">a memory diagram generator</a> and <a href="../../../../2022/11/30/what-i-want-for-code-in-textbooks/">a code annotator</a>.
Talking to people about them,
and about <a href="../../../../2022/11/13/the-notebook-not-taken/">an alternative history for computational notebooks</a>,
has reminded me that I&rsquo;ve never actually explained
why learning programming is much harder than actually programming.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the physical organization of a small program.
The boxes can represent files in a directory structure or a class inheritance hierarchy;
what matters is that a programmer who wants to work with this code
must build a mental model of what&rsquo;s where:</p>
<p><img src="../../../../files/2022/physical_organization.svg" alt="physical structure of code in a lesson" class="centered"></p>
<p>They must also build a mental model of what runs in what order:</p>
<p><img src="../../../../files/2022/execution_flow.svg" alt="flow of execution through code in a lesson" class="centered"></p>
<p>If a programmer wants to add a feature or fix a bug,
they need to have two models in their head at once
along with the difference between them:</p>
<p><img src="../../../../files/2022/single_change.svg" alt="mental model of a single change to a program" class="centered"></p>
<p>Keeping that straight is more difficult than remembering either model on its own,
but what happens when we&rsquo;re trying to teach or learn programming?
In particular,
what happens when we&rsquo;re trying to explain the design of even a small program step by step?</p>
<p>I tried to draw an example for this blog post but couldn&rsquo;tâ€”not in two dimensions.
The problem is the need for a third kind of connection
that links changes to physical elements and execution paths.
It&rsquo;s just barely readable for a single small change:</p>
<p><img src="../../../../files/2022/connecting_changes.svg" alt="connecting changes to program" class="centered"></p>
<p>but some programs in <a href="../../../../sdxjs/"><em>Software Design by Example</em></a> evolve ten or eleven times.
If I draw those changes side by side with the change connectors on top of the diagrams,
the result is unreadable.
The only solution I can think of is to use a third dimension:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>spatial: stack the versions on top of each other like panes of glass
    so that the change connectors run vertically</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>temporal: animate the additions, deletions, and modifications
    so that the person trying to understand them
    only has to keep one or two in their head at a time</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both options would require more sophisticated tools
and much (much) more time than most instructors have,
but that&rsquo;s not the point.
The point is that no matter what we do,
<em>it&rsquo;s harder to understand than everyday programming</em>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to fix some data access code at work right now.
I&rsquo;ve been working on the problem for two days and have touched about two dozen files,
but I only need to keep two mental models in my head at once.
If I was teaching someone how this code had grown over time
in response to new requirements,
they and I would have to build half a dozen mental models one after another,
<em>and</em> keep track of the connections between the newest one and its predecessor.
We could probably dump parts of the older models as we formed the newer ones,
but only parts,
and &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; is the wrong metaphor here anyway.
Our brains can&rsquo;t discard information the way a computer can flush a cache,
and the no-longer-relevant parts of old models would linger
and interfere with the new models we&rsquo;re trying to form.
(&ldquo;Wait, are we using callbacks or observers at this point?&rdquo;)</p>
<p>We can try to minimize the need for third-dimensional thinking
by presenting learners with finished, full-formed programs,
but that only teaches &ldquo;what&rdquo;, not &ldquo;why&rdquo; or &ldquo;how&rdquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Why do we split the array at <code>mid-1</code> instead of <code>mid</code>?&rdquo;
    To avoid an edge case that I haven&rsquo;t shown you
    and that doesn&rsquo;t cause problems if the code is written correctly
    right from the start.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;How did you figure out why the split has to be <code>mid-1</code>?&rdquo;
    By testing an edge case that only fails with incorrect code,
    figuring out why it failed,
    and then figuring out where to make the necessary change.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of which is to say,
if programming is like playing chess,
learning to program is like playing three-dimensional chess
when there&rsquo;s a cat in the room who occasionally jumps up on the board and knocks the pieces around.
This is why I believe that having learners start with &ldquo;real&rdquo; tools
like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> or <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebooks</a> is misguided:
they increase <a href="https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:architecture-load">cognitive load</a> by solving problems learners don&rsquo;t have yet,
but more importantly,
they don&rsquo;t even address the unique problems that teachers and learners have.</p>
<p>Tools to help people understand the evolution of code over time would be useful to working programmers as well,
but twenty-five years after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language">UML</a> was standardized,
it still doesn&rsquo;t have a way to represent <em>changes</em> to programs.
No other notation I&rsquo;m familiar with can do this either;
they all describe static snapshots of programs
rather than the dynamic, evolving programs we all build, learn, and teach.
Solving this is just <a href="../../../../ideas/research/">one question among many</a>,
but speaking as a teacher,
it&rsquo;s one of the most important.
If you&rsquo;re working on it,
or know someone who is,
I&rsquo;d be grateful for a pointer.</p><!-- /content -->
