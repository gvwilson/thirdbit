<!-- content --><p>I had the pleasure of seeing <a href="https://www.apreshill.com/">Alison Hill</a>
talk about computational notebooks last week.
<a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>,
<a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a>,
<a href="https://www.wolfram.com/notebooks/">Wolfram Notebooks</a>,
and the like are now many scientists&rsquo; preferred way to think in code.
Having used several,
I can&rsquo;t help but wonder if there&rsquo;s a universe out there
in which we took a different path.
Instead of starting with Markdown and slowly edging toward a full-featured editor,
did someone on Earth-978 write a plugin for <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a>
to run code and insert its output into the document?
It&rsquo;s technically feasible:
there&rsquo;s no reason something like the <a href="https://jupyter-protocol.readthedocs.io/">Jupyer protocol</a>
couldn&rsquo;t have been invented with a WYSIWYG editor as the first front end
instead of a browser.</p>
<p>Earth-977&rsquo;s history took yet another path.
There,
Microsoft included what they called a &ldquo;computational bridge&rdquo; in Office 2007.
It was designed to help people create automated reports,
but scientists almost immediately adopted it as well:
most of them were already using Word and Excel,
and found that learning a bit of VB.NET to push around their dataframes
was a lot easier than shifting to an entirely new suite of tools.
By the time Google Docs appeared,
active code blocks were as normal (and as expected) as drawings and tables.
A few holdouts continued to use Python and R in text-only editors and IDEs,
but once a consortium sponsored by Microsoft, Google, and Apple
implemented diff and merge for office documents,
the battle was effectively over.</p>
<p>I suspect <a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Earth-1218">our universe</a> unfolded differently
for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Most computational scientists don&rsquo;t know Java or .NET.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most programmers look down on WYSIWYG editors.
    As a result,
    auxiliary tools from <code>grep</code> to Git can&rsquo;t handle things
    that aren&rsquo;t backward-compatible with punchcards.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe the LibreOffice path is still viable in our universe.
The <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/dark-matter-developers-the-unseen-99">unseen 99%</a>
of scientists (data or otherwise)
don&rsquo;t yet use computational notebooks of any kind.
With the distinction between desktop and cloud growing ever blurrier,
and with so many of the pieces needed for this approach already available,
I think a startup could make a compelling case that
accountants, marketing executives, and others
would prefer something evolutionary
over a browser-based dashboarding tool
or something as alien as today&rsquo;s notebooks.</p>
<p><em>Note: this post was inspired in part by my move from Twitter to
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@gvwilson">Mastodon</a>.
The differences between the two have got me thinking about
how chancy and evitable our technologies are,
and about how many alternatives we have yet to explore.</em></p><!-- /content -->
