  <strong>Problem #1</strong>
</p>
<p>
  A couple of years ago,
  I put together a bibliography
  of research into the software engineering aspects of scientific computing.
  I'd now like to find all papers published in the last five years that reference anything in the existing bibliography.
  As far as I can tell,
  though,
  the tool I want doesn't exist:
  I can ask for references to a <em>particular</em> paper,
  but there's nothing that will take a set of several hundred,
  grow the reference graph,
  and sort by relevance.
  If you know of something,
  please give it a try and let me know how it does:
  the raw bibliography data is in <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/bib/software-carpentry.bib">this BibTeX file</a>,
  and I'm <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">easy to reach</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Problem #2</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Someone once said that chemistry is anything chemists do that other chemists agree is chemistry.
  So I thought,
  maybe we can figure out what computer science is by looking at what computer scientists do<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.
  But since I don't have a budget to do a broad observational study<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>,
  I need some other way to figure out what computer scientists think is in bounds.
</p>
<p>
  Enter the <a href="http://awards.acm.org/doctoral_dissertation/year.cfm">ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award</a>,
  which has been given out every year since 1978.
  If we threw a couple of keywords on each,
  tallied them up,
  and combined those tallies with a similar accounting of <a href="http://amturing.acm.org/byyear.cfm">Turing Award Winners</a>' specialties,
  we'd have a good idea of what computer science thinks it is.
</p>
<p>
  The problem is,
  I don't know enough to classify the dissertation awards myself
  (certainly not based solely on their titles).
  I need their ACM keywords,
  or failing that,
  their abstracts,
  but I'm damned if I can find either online.
  Printed copies of the award winners are apparently archived in Washington DC,
  but that's not much help.
  If you know how I could do this,
  I really am <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">easy to reach</a>.

  [2] One of the reasons I quit academia was that my grant applications were turned down
  five times out of five.
