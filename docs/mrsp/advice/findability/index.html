  The <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">FAIR Principles</a>
  encourage researchers to make data findable,
  accessible interoperable, and reusable [<a href="../../bibliography/#Wilkinson2016">Wilkinson2016</a>].
  The tips below, taken from [<a href="../../bibliography/#Lin2020">Lin2020</a>], will
  help you turn those principles into practice.
</p>

<dl>

  <dt>Design for a wide range of users.</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    You might think only a few experts know your field well enough to care
    about your data, newcomers also need to use your work to gain
    experience, and other people may access your work in translation or
    via a screen reader.  Establish context, to use clear and concise
    language, and minimize the use of jargon.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Design with the end in mind.</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Think ahead about the things you would want to be found at the
    completion of the project, including relevant preprints, and then
    decide what should go where. For example:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Finalized laboratory data can be stored in <a href="https://datadryad.org/">Dryad</a>
        so that you can cite the same data source in multiple publications with a single DOI.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lab protocols can be maintained in <a href="https://www.protocols.io/">Protocols.io</a>
        so that future collaborators can find them using a DOI
        while keeping incomplete protocol drafts private.
      </li>
      <li>
        Analysis code can be deposited in <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>,
        which you can cite and update as code evolves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Research manuscripts can be posted to sites like <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your ORCID can be linked to each of the DOIs created by these repositories.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Use textual structure.</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    A key part of searching the web is scanning the text returned by
    search engines to see if it contains target information.  Textual
    structure helps that process: formatted headers (rather than just
    enlarged text), bulleted or numbered lists, and highlighted terms all
    make both the information and its structure easier to understand.
    Other examples include:
    <ul>
      <li>
        GitHub allows users to add tags to issues and commit messages which
        can then be searched across projects.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using specific Google Docs heading levels creates a table of
        contents in real time, visible when the file is open.
      </li>
      <li>
        CSV files do not have a standard way to store metadata, but authors
        commonly create a README or MANIFEST file that describes the
        structure and content of the files in a collection.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Add metadata.</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    All modern operating systems allow you to add information to the
    properties of a file or directory. Databases, word processors, and
    website construction programs also have built-in metadata
    capabilities, though application-specific metadata can quickly become
    inconsistent. Creating a list of terms and writing a small program to
    check that only terms from that list goes a long way toward preventing
    this.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Use search and browsing.</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    People search <em>and</em> browse when they're trying to find information, so
    design for both. As people browse, they build a mental map of the
    content they could possibly find, then search based on that map.  You
    should therefore make information accessible both ways and make it
    easy to move from searching to browsing and back again. Tags and other
    metadata help with searching, while structural clues tell users about
    the content contained in the information they are looking at.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Mimic real world directions.</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Research shows that people scan but don't read: they click on the
    first close thing they see and give up very, very quickly.  Markers
    and directions should therefore be as consistent as highway signs with
    regards to appearance, style, and type of information.
    File paths and breadcrumb trails on websites give users a sense of
    where information is and suggest new paths they can take. For example,
    the URLs of a website might all include the name of a section of the
    site, such as <code>/papers/</code> or <code>/blog/</code>,
    while DOIs and ORCIDs serve as beacons that people can always get back to.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Use meaningful names.</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Filenames and URLs are the one kind of metadata you can't avoid
    creating, so always choose ones that are human-readable and that
    convey information about what they name, both when navigated to <em>and</em>
    when returned in search results. For example, it's easy to call a
    paper <code>nature2021.pdf</code>, but since other people will publish papers
    there that year, a longer name like <code>wilson-managing-rse-plos-2021.pdf</code>
    will convey more information at a glance and retain that information
    after the paper has been downloaded and put in a folder with dozens of
    others.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Use unusual names.</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    The more generic a term is, the harder it is to search
    for. A quick test is to search for the name before adopting it: if
    dozens of unrelated results come up, you may want to pick a different
    name.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Use tags.</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    After meaningful names, tags are the easiest and most effective
    metadata you can create. Most tools support tagging, and most search
    tools use them to narrow the scope of queries.  This means that you
    can now file a single thing in multiple "locations", which was not
    possible in the pre-digital era. Multiple tags also assist users from
    varied backgrounds because the terms can be customized to be inclusive
    of a diverse set of users.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Use other people's tags.</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Where possible, used established subject terms taken from article
    databases, data repositories, and library catalogs that you and your
    users might already be familiar with, such as the National Cancer
    Institute Thesaurus and the Medical Subject Headings.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Understand the difference between format and subject.</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Format describes what your content <em>is</em>, while subject describes what
    it is <em>about</em>: for example, this <em>is</em> a web page, but it is <em>about</em>
    making information findable. You can rely on filename suffixes to
    distinguish computational notebooks from PDF files, tabular data sets,
    or slide decks, but file formats can change (e.g., slides can be printed as a PDF).
    Naming and metadata conventions threfore tend to be more robust as well as more
    informative than relying on file types.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Do not abbrvt.</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Acronyms and abbreviations make communication between those who know
    them more efficient at the price of making them less accessible to
    newcomers. Spell out acronyms and abbreviations that you take for
    granted (or hyperlink to their definitions), but remember that
    acronyms are often repurposed by different professions or disciplines,
    so write them all out the first time they appear or point to a
    glossary.
