<!-- content --><p>It&rsquo;s that time again: students in my CSC302 software engineering class are doing peer assessments next week, and soon after that I&rsquo;ll have to assign grades to them and the <a href="http://ucosp.wordpress.com">UCOSP</a> students. It&rsquo;s got me thinking about what grade <em>I</em> deserve for my time at <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca">U of T</a>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>For mentoring undergrad students: A-. Not all of my students have enjoyed working with me (see Exhibit A), but I think most have learned something useful. On the other hand, none of the projects themselves ever became independently viable (something that I'll blog about separately).</li>
  <li>For the <a href="http://web.cs.toronto.edu/program/grad/mscac.htm">Master of  Science in Applied Computing</a>: B+. I think it's going to be an  excellent program, but it took longer to get going than it should have.</li>
  <li>For regular classroom teaching: B-. This one isn't a guess—my course evaluations have been OK, but not great. The longer I teach, the more respect I have for how organized, polished, and thoughtful some of my colleagues are…</li>
  <li>For supervising grad students: I honestly don't know. Of the 11 who started with me, 3 are in progress, 2 switched to other supervisors, and 5 of the remaining 6 finished on time. None of them have published anything based on their theses, so by conventional measures, I haven't done very well. C+?</li>
  <li>For my own research: F. <a href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/">NSERC</a> turned down every grant application I ever submitted, but that's just an excuse: I could and should have done a <em>lot</em> more than I actually did. The real reason I failed was that I repeatedly pushed aside big things that didn't have fixed target dates in order to work on smaller things that did (which is ironic, considering how often and how strenuously I warn my students not to do exactly that).</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;d give myself a B-. That&rsquo;s by no means a bad grade, but I&rsquo;m still disappointed. I had all the information I needed to make better decisions—I just didn&rsquo;t think things through. Here&rsquo;s hoping I do a better job on <a href="http://softwarecarpentry.wordpress.com/course-outline/">my next project</a>.</p><!-- /content -->
