<!-- content --><p>The April 2010 issue of <a href="http://cacm.acm.org/"><em>Communications of the ACM</em></a> has an article by Keith Wright titled &ldquo;Capstone Programming Courses Considered Harmful&rdquo;. Dr. Wright teaches business intelligence courses at the University of Houston-Downtown, and once you get past the three and a half columns of autobiography that he opens with, his thesis is:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Enrolment in CS programs is down. OK, no problem so far.</li>
  <li>"…a lucrative United States career as a generalist professional programmer [is] a thing of the past" because the jobs are being offshored. Hm… OK, it's not that clear-cut, but I'm still on side.</li>
  <li>Further, there has been a "…dramatic decline in demand for U.S. programmers over the period from 1974 to 2004." Uh, what? Oh, there's a footnote (pg. 126): "Demand for database, ERP, and ecommerce servers skills are on the rise." I'm confused: does he think that making Oracle, SAP, and WebSphere behave doesn't count as programming? And even if that's true, demand for programmers has <em>declined</em> from 1974 to 2004? Crap.</li>
  <li>"When designing computing curriculums, it is useful to first consider the capstone courses." Not the way I'd do it, but OK.</li>
  <li>I need to break the next paragraph down line by line:
<ul>
  <li>"Many of today's capstone courses involve locating real programming projects in the community." Sure, the good ones.</li>
  <li>"However, this is often too time consuming." Compared to what? And why does he think it's any harder for CS than for the engineering schools (most of which have to include a year-long capstone to keep their accreditation)?</li>
  <li>"Furthermore, real projects are usually too difficult for college seniors." Crap. There are projects of all shapes and sizes out there, from porting Django to Python 3 down to tweaking the web site for a local community group.</li>
  <li>"Other capstone computing courses have students working individually on imaginary projects, giving them a chance to build something they own." OK.</li>
  <li>"Unfortunately, this may give students a poor understanding of the real world." Well, sure, if it's done badly, and the same can be said of any coursework.</li>
  <li>"Finally, we do students a disservice if capstone courses give them the impression they are likely to become professional programmers." Ah, now we come to it…</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That last point is, I think, the hinge of the whole article. Wright thinks that most CS graduates are going to go off and do things that aren&rsquo;t programming (like, you know, building web applications &lsquo;n&rsquo; stuff), and that having them do a big programming project in their final year is therefore misleading. His solution?</p>
<blockquote>I believe part of the answer lies in industry best practices like those captured in the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) and the corresponding international standard—ISO 20000. So I suggest…that capstone programming projects be replaced with the following internships:
<ul>
  <li>Service desk (first-line customer support).</li>
  <li>Change management.</li>
  <li>Programming (good to see this hasn't been thrown out completely).</li>
  <li>Networking (configuring, diagnosing problems, etc.).</li>
  <li>Problem control (by which he means operating system administration).</li>
  <li>Service level management: "Emphasized would be the writing of ethical service level agreements, underpinning contracts, and operational level agreements." Yee hah, I can feel my heart pounding faster already.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I find it hard to think of a better way than this to drive bright students away from computer science: if we offered the <a href="http://ucosp.wordpress.com">UCOSP</a> students job training for Fortune 500 IT departments, we wouldn&rsquo;t <em>have</em> any UCOSP students. Yes, a stint on the help desk is a good reality check, and it&rsquo;s important for computer scientists to realize how confusing our creations are to the 99.5% of humanity who can&rsquo;t think recursively. And yes, software engineers should know what a service level contract looks like (preferably an ethical one, whatever that means), but computer science is supposed to be <em>exciting</em>, dammit, and Wright&rsquo;s vision of computing is about as exciting as a vending machine ham-and-cheese sandwich. Compare his ideas with those of real innovators like <a href="https://cs.senecac.on.ca/~david.humphrey/">David Humphrey</a> (who, by the way, has actually tried his out), and it&rsquo;s painfully clear who&rsquo;s looking backward, and who&rsquo;s going to lead us forward.
