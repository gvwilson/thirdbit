  I am pleased to announce that
  our interim Steering Committee
  has adopted bylaws for the Software Carpentry Foundation,
  which is the final step in us becoming an independent organization.
  The authoritative version is stored in
  this public GitHub repository,
  along with other key documents that will be outlined in the next couple of blog posts.
  In brief,
  the SCF has four parts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    the <em>Membership</em>,
    which includes active instructors and others contributing directly to the project;
  </li>
  <li>
    the <em>Steering Committee</em>,
    which is elected by and from the membership and is the SCF's primary decision-making body;
  </li>
  <li>
    the <em>Advisory Council</em>,
    which includes representatives from our major partners,
    and
  </li>
  <li>
    the <em>Executive Director</em>,
    who is an employee of the SCF responsible for overseeing its daily operations.
    The Executive Director answers to the Steering Committee,
    but is not a member of it.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  I have accepted the position of interim Executive Director,
  and the first elections for the Steering Committee will be held early in 2015.
  These bylaws,
  and the agreement with <a href="http://numfocus.org">NumFOCUS</a>
  that enables us to operate as a 501(c)3 non-profit,
  are the structure we need to run a successful independent foundation.
</p>
<p>
  The next priority is fundraising:
  I've been without a salary since my contract with Mozilla ended in October,
  which clearly isn't sustainable.
  The next post in this series describes
  the different ways in which organizations can support us;
  we're close to signing deals with several groups,
  so I'm confident we'll start the new year with our finances in order.

<li><p>All requests for Software Carpentry training must be shared promptly with core staff and member organization representatives, and summarized monthly to the Steering Committee.</p></li>
<li><p>Responsibility for arranging workshops will be allocated geographically, or as otherwise directed by the Steering Committee in consultation with the Advisory Council and member organizations.</p></li>
<li><p>No person or organization may offer Software Carpentry branded certification without prior approval from the Steering Committee.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The Software Carpentry Foundation raises and spends money in support of the goals listed in its mission statement.</p>
