  Short version: we will launch a second pilot study of code review
  for scientific software in February 2014, in which experienced
  mentors will teach small groups of scientists how and when to do
  reviews.  We are currently looking for both mentors and groups to
  take part.
</p>
<p>
  Long version: despite research becoming increasingly reliant on
  software, very little of that code is worked on in a collaborative
  fashion or shared before a paper is published (if at all), and even
  less is checked during the peer review process.  In August-September
  2013, the Mozilla Science Lab, PLOS, and Prof. Marian Petre (Open
  University, UK) therefore conducted a
  pilot study
  of code review of scientific software.  Professional
  software developers form Mozilla reviewed parts of the software
  associated with papers published during the preceding year in "PLoS
  Computational Biology", and those reviews were then shared with the
  authors of the papers.
</p>
<p>
  This study's principal findings were that:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    both developers and scientists were enthusiastic about the
    possibility of collaborating in this way, but
  </li>
  <li>
    a "drive-by" review at the end of the research process by someone
    who didn't understand the science being investigated wasn't
    actually much help.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  We now believe that scientists would benefit more from ongoing
  reviews as they develop their code, and that the reviewer must be
  familiar with the science itself in order to do a "deep" review.
  We know from a variety of studies that code review not only improves the quality of software,
  but also increases programmers' productivity
  (because "measure twice, cut once" saves time).
  While most researchers are not programmers,
  and most code in a lab is not written for use by other people,
  we want to find out whether code review will have the same benefits in science.
</p>
<p>
  More importantly, though, we want to see whether integrating code
  review into the research cycle will spur scientists to work in more
  open, more collaborative ways in general.  Once researchers are used
  to reading one another's code, will they be more likely to re-use it
  as well?  Will adoption of code review encourage them to use more
  open tools in writing their papers, and help them see how to make
  data more reusable as well?
</p>
<p>
  To start answering these questions, we plan to conduct a second
  pilot study beginning next month.  In it, we will match an
  experienced scientist-programmer (the mentor) with a small
  pre-existing team of scientists who are developing and sharing
  software, but who do not think of themselves primarily as software
  developers, and who are not yet doing code reviews.  The mentor will
  do a small number of code reviews early in the study to show the
  team what reviews look like, when they should be done, how results
  should be communicated, etc.  After that, mentors will be
  responsible for coaching the scientists over a 12-week period as
  they do reviews themselves.
</p>
<p>
  We will observe mentors and teams throughout the study period to
  determine:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    what skills are actually transferred,
  </li>
  <li>
    how those skills are adapted to meet scientists' domain-specific needs,
  </li>
  <li>
    what transference techniques are most effective, and
  </li>
  <li>
    what other shifts in working practice result (e.g., more
    collaborative or iterative work).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  All findings will be published under open access licenses to encourage
  further discussion and uptake.
</p>
<p>
  We will start this study in February 2014.  We are currently looking
  for a few more mentors, and more importantly, for small groups of
  scientists who would like to give code review a try.  If you are
  interested, please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">mail us</a> a
  short paragraph describing your research, and a link to your version
  control repository if you have one.

  <em>FAQ</em>
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>How good a domain match between developer and science group can we hope for?</dt>
  <dd>
    We should be able to match physicists with physicists and ecologists with ecologists,
    but anything finer-grained than that is unlikely.
  </dd>
  <dt>Does the software have to be open source and publicly available?</dt>
  <dd>
    Yes.
    This is partly a matter of setting a good example,
    but we also want to avoid the overhead of managing non-disclosure agreements.
  </dd>
  <dt>Do mentors and groups have to be physically co-located?</dt>
  <dd>
    Noâ€“in fact,
    we expect that most mentors <em>won't</em> be in the same place as the groups they're working with,
    but will instead interact via Skype, email, and the like.
