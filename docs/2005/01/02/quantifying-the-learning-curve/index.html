<!-- content --><p>Back in the 1980s, R.W. Hockney introduced two measures for quantifying the performance of pipelined machines.  The first, <em>r<sub>∞</sub></em>, is the pipeline&rsquo;s maximum possible performance when startup effects are ignored (or equivalently, its performance on an infinitely-long vector).  The second, <em>n<sub>½</sub></em>, is the half-performance length, i.e. how much data you need to feed the processor in order for it to achieve half its peak performance.</p>
<p>In the mid-90s, I suggested (tongue only partly in cheek) that another performance measure would be equally interesting: how long it takes a programmer to learn how to write code that achieves half a machine&rsquo;s rated performance.  I called it <em>p<sub>½</sub></em>, and observed that for many supercomputers, it was effectively infinity, since no application ever delivered more than 10-20% of the performance their manufacturers claimed for them.</p>
<p>I believe that <em>p<sub>½</sub></em> is one of the most important things for instructors to consider when deciding what tools to use in an educational setting.  In a one-term course, how productive students are after they&rsquo;ve mastered a tool is less important than how quickly they can learn enough about that tool to start doing things with it.  A web server that does 100 things, but takes 100 hours to set up, is a lot less useful than a web server than only does 20 things, but only takes 10 hours to set up.</p>
<p><em>p<sub>½</sub></em> is why so many of this term&rsquo;s projects are being done in <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>.  In particular, it&rsquo;s the reason we&rsquo;re putting the Java version of Hippo [<a href="#1">1</a>] on the shelf for a term, and re-starting the project with Edgewall&rsquo;s <a href="http://projects.edgewall.com/trac">Trac</a>. Our experience in Fall 2004 was that it took students 20-40 hours to become familiar <a href="http://www.hibernate.org">Hibernate</a>, <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry">Tapestry</a>, and related Java tools, and another 10-20 to learn the existing Hippo code well enough to figure out what should be done next.  That&rsquo;s 30-60% of the total time allotted for the course, just to get to the point where they could start coding.</p>
<p>One of my goals this term is to find out whether agile languages (like <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>) have a lower <em>p<sub>½</sub></em> than sturdy ones like Java.  It isn&rsquo;t quite the question people usually ask [<a href="#2">2</a>], but from an instructional point of view, I think it&rsquo;s just as important.</p>
<p>[<a name="1"></a>1] Hippo is a lightweight software project management portal, similar to <a href="http://www.sf.net">SourceForge</a>, but customized for academic use.  In particular, it omits features that undergraduate course projects don&rsquo;t need, but provides a scripting interface so that instructors and administrators can create dozens or hundreds of identical projects, bug reports, etc. at once.</p>
<p>[<a name="2"></a>2] Many people claim that dynamic, freely-typed, agile languages like Python make programmers more productive than static, type-checked, sturdy languages like Java.  Many other people claim the reverse, but offer just as little empirical evidence.  Most of this debate focus on how productive experienced programmers are <em>after</em> they&rsquo;ve mastered the language and the tools associated with it, or how quickly people can get their first &ldquo;Hello, world&rdquo; program up and running, rather than how long it takes programmers using a particular language to reach some acceptable level of productivity.</p><!-- /content -->
