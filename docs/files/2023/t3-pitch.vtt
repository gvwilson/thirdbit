By the time you leave high school, you probably know what vitamins
are, how germs spread, and where babies come from. You probably don’t
know equally basic facts about how people learn and how best to teach
them.

00:12 --> 00:33
This is more important than you probably realize. Most of us learn
most of what we know on the job, from our peers, and by browsing
online—not in a formal classroom. Knowing a little about how to teach
and learn will therefore help you onboard new team members, give
better technical support to customers, and learn more and more quickly
yourself.

00:33 --> 00:41
The workshop will take place online in two half-day sessions on
consecutive days with lots of hands-on work and feedback.

00:41 --> 00:51
Your instructor has been teaching people how to program, and how to
teach, for over thirty years, and has taught this particular workshop
more than fifty times on three continents.

00:51 --> 01:06
And all of the money raised from this workshop will be donated to
Rainbow Railroad, which helps LGBTQ+ refugees from state violence
resettle in safer countries. So come and learn, and help make the
world a slightly better place at the same time.
