## Making Decisions

1.  ____ is the project lead (PL) and has final say on all decisions in this
    project.  They may consult when and as they think best, but any votes they
    call are purely advisory.

2.  The PL may delegate authority in whole or in part to anyone at any time, and
    revoke any such delegation at their discretion.

3.  To request a decision from the PL, file an issue in this repository tagged
    "discussion".

4.  All decisions, including delegation or revocation of authority, will be
    recorded in this file.

5.  The PL can change these rules at any time, and will announce changes in the
    project's blog and by updating this file.

## Recording Decisions

Decisions that have been made are listed below in reverse chronological order.
Each entry contains:

-   the date the decision was made,
