# Teaching Tech Together

We know as much about teaching and learning as we do about public health, but most people in tech have never encountered basic ideas in evidence-based pedagogy. A few key ideas will help you build more effective lessons in less time and with less effort, make your lessons easier for people to find and reuse, and help you figure out what impact they are having.

This workshop has been taught over 30 times since 2017 for companies, public libraries, and open source organizations. It introduces key techniques that apply to onboarding, technical support, and self-paced learning as well as traditional classroom settings (online as well as in person). Topics include:

- creating learner personas
- why novices, competent practitioners, and experts need different lessons
- managing cognitive load
- formative and summative assessment
- what motivates and demotivates learners
- teaching as a performance art
