<h1>The Cloudherd and the Tiger's Boy</h1>



<ol id="toc"></ol>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p><em>Consider Cherne.
A diamond adrift in the heavens,
it measures eight thousand gallops from north to south
and six thousand from east to west.
Its single continent is surrounded on all sides by a great ocean
whose outer shore, the Worldrim, is an unbroken range of mountains
whose peaks tower above even the highest-flying cloud.</em></p>
<p><em>Cherne&rsquo;s history began with the Pilots,
and nearly ended with them as well.
Powerful and inhuman,
they destroyed themselves in a war
that scarred the moon and turned Lake Karaband into a sea of glass.
When the last battle was over the Pilots were gone,
leaving the world to carry on as best it could.</em></p>
<p><em>Now look there,
in the north,
where the Brumoso Mountains rise above the endless squabbles of the Ninety Kingdoms.
It is Redsday, the 11th of Peridot, 1272 Years Since,
and a girl who is no longer a child but not quite yet a woman
is standing on a cloud,
chilled to the bone and desperately hoping that
the old man beside her knows what he&rsquo;s doing&hellip;</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; Grappa Gas bellowed.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to get bumpy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noxy dropped to one knee,
pulling the glove off her left hand
and pressing her palm into Big Blue&rsquo;s spongy gray back.
She could mind-hear how tired the cloud was.
He was even older than Grappa Gas,
and had just flown hard into a headwind for an hour.</p>
<p><em>Faster!</em> she urged.
<em>Please, faster!</em>
She shivered despite her camelskin hat and coat,
her bare hand already numbed by the icy mountain air.</p>
<p>Behind her,
the tiger Kulbinder snarled at the crows that had attacked them.
One broke off from the swirling flock and dove at his head.
He swiped at it with one paw,
cursing in Thindi as the black bird snapped its wings open
so that the wind threw it sideways
just an instant before the tiger&rsquo;s claws would have torn it apart.</p>
<p>Up ahead,
a barren stump of rock rose like an island out of the forest.
Half a dozen drab gray tents huddled around a small fire on top of it.
Shading her eyes with her free hand,
Noxy saw the soldiers they were supposed to rescue.
Their kilts and sturdy boots were travel-stained,
and their battle masks and lacquered leather armor were scarred from fighting.
Some had swords in their hands,
while others held spears or bows.
Big Blue&rsquo;s mate Pillow was directly above them,
her sides rippling as she struggled to keep station in the wind,
but the soldiers kept their eyes on the trees,
waiting for the forest to attack again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming in too low!&rdquo; Granna Fee yelled.
Noxy&rsquo;s grandmother lay full length on Big Blue,
propped up on her elbows with her precious binoculars in her hands.
&ldquo;Level off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no time!&rdquo; Grappa Gas yelled back,
his red-and-yellow scarf flapping madly behind him.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have to bump and scrape!&rdquo;
The old man closed his eyes.
His lips moved as he mind-spoke commands to the cloud beneath him.
Noxy mind-heard Big Blue protest,
but even as the old bull grumbled he bunched up
and went into a long, steep dive.</p>
<p>Noxy had just a moment to think,
<em>I&rsquo;d be grounded for a <strong>month</strong> if I even <strong>thought</strong> about doing something like this,</em>
and then the cloud thudded against the side of the peak like a sack full of wet wool.
Noxy yelped and sprawled forward,
landing in an untidy heap on Granna Fee&rsquo;s legs.
&ldquo;Sorry!&rdquo; she said,
but her grandmother was already up,
swaying to keep her balance as the cloud scraped across the rock,
flattened two tents,
and came to a halt.</p>
<p>The tiger bounded off with a roar.
&ldquo;What are you waiting for!?&rdquo; Granna Fee shouted at the soldiers,
sliding down Big Blue&rsquo;s flank and waving her arm as if to sweep them all onto the cloud.
&ldquo;Get on! Get on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grappa Gas caught Noxy&rsquo;s arm as she scrambled back onto her feet.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help &lsquo;em up. You stay here and keep Blue together.&rdquo;
Without waiting for her to answer he stumped forward,
his peg leg leaving dimples in the cloud.
&ldquo;And keep an eye out for squirrels!&rdquo;
he yelled over his shoulder.</p>
<p>Noxy glanced at the forest.
Something big and brown swing between two trees.
Another hairy shape followed it,
then another.
Suddenly the trees were full of them,
hooting and shaking the branches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grappa! Grappa! trolls!&rdquo; she shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see &lsquo;em!&rdquo; the old man shouted back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a bear!&rdquo; Noxy added
as a brown bear charged out of the trees and reared up on its hind legs
to bellow a challenge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of <em>course</em> there&rsquo;s a bear,&rdquo;
Grappa Gas grunted as he clasped hands with the nearest soldier
and helped him scramble up onto the cloud.
A second soldier tossed his spear aside and pulled himself up beside the first.
Together they reached back and hauled up a third man
while Grappa Gas reached for a fourth.</p>
<p>But instead of grabbing the cloudherd&rsquo;s hand,
the man on the ground lifted a heavy canvas-wrapped bundle.
&ldquo;Never mind that, get yourself up here!&rdquo; Grappa Gas ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not leaving them!&rdquo; the man on the ground yelled back.
One of the soldiers already on the cloud shouldered Grappa Gas aside,
grabbed a handful the canvas,
and tried to drag it onto the cloud.
His legs sank halfway to his knees with the weight.</p>
<p>Noxy felt Big Blue shudder beneath them.
She dropped to her knees and pressed her hand against the cloud once again.
<em>He didn&rsquo;t mean to,</em> she mind-said,
trying to squelch her fear so that he couldn&rsquo;t mind-hear it.
<em>Please, stay bunched up just a little longer.</em>
She pictured the cloud pulling itself into a dense blob.
Reluctantly,
the cloud began to contract.</p>
<p>Noxy heard a shrill whistle from her friends keeping watch on board Pillow.
The trolls stopped hooting.
Cold fear jellied in her gut.
&ldquo;Grappa&mdash;&rdquo; she started to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just keep him together!&rdquo; Grappa Gas snapped.
Cursing, he yanked another soldier up onto the cloud.
This one was no older than she was,
Noxy realized,
his face marked by four parallel scars that looked like they had only just healed.
He took two steps before his feet slipped out from under him.
He fell awkwardly beside the half-dozen canvas-wrapped bundles
that now lay side by side on Big Blue&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>The tiger scrambled up the cloud behind the boy.
Noxy mind-heard Big Blue&rsquo;s protest as the great cat&rsquo;s claws dug into his flank.
<em>Just a little longer,</em> she begged.
<em>Please, just a little longer.</em></p>
<p>She glanced at the forest.
A brown mass swirled back and forth around the bases of the trees like blown leaves.
Above it, the trolls began hooting again
as the will of the forest surged through their minds like a raging flood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spread yourselves out, you numbskulls!&rdquo;
Grappa Gas thundered at the soldiers struggling not to sink into the cloud.
&ldquo;Lie down if you have to!
Come on, Fee, we gotta fly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noxy&rsquo;s grandmother clambered up Big Blue&rsquo;s flank
with a speed born from decades of practice.
&ldquo;Now or never!&rdquo; she yelled at the last soldier.
He grabbed a handful of cloud
just as a swarm of squirrels burst out of the forest and surged up the rocky slope,
thousands of them leaping from stone to stone,
their bright, mad eyes fixed on the intruders.</p>
<p><em>Up!</em> Noxy mind-yelled at Big Blue.
The cloud heaved himself into the air.</p>
<p>The last soldier hung on desperately
as the cloud&rsquo;s flank squished between his fingers like soggy dough.
A dozen squirrels jumped at his legs.
One managed to catch hold of his boot,
scrambling up the laces and sinking its teeth into his calf.
The soldier cursed and kicked it off.</p>
<p>The young soldier with the scarred face
flung himself across the cloud and grabbed his comrade&rsquo;s hand.
Without thinking,
Noxy threw herself onto the soldier&rsquo;s legs
to stop him from being dragged off by his comrade&rsquo;s weight.
Grunting and cursing,
they somehow managed to get the last soldier up onto Big Blue&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You idiot!&rdquo; Grappa Gas yelled as the soldier rolled over onto his back,
gasping.
&ldquo;You saints-be-damned <em>idiot</em>!
They would have peeled you like an apple!
What was so damned important that you couldn&rsquo;t just leave it?&rdquo;
He kicked one of the bundles.
&ldquo;Eh? What was so&mdash;urp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In one smooth motion the soldier had rolled onto his feet
and grabbed a handful of Grappa Gas&rsquo;s collar.
&ldquo;With respect, honored, I&rsquo;m grateful for the rescue,&rdquo;
he panted.
&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s one of my men you&rsquo;re kicking,
and I&rsquo;ll be thanking you to stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He let go of Grappa Gas&rsquo;s coat.
The cloudherd coughed.
&ldquo;Ah.
Sorry, lad.
I didn&rsquo;t realize.&rdquo;
He looked down at the bodies lying at his feet.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soldier nodded.
&ldquo;Me too.&rdquo;
He stared back at the stump of rock,
where the squirrels had already torn the tents to pieces.
&ldquo;Me too.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Earlier that day&hellip;</em></p>
<p>Noxy and Sensy volunteered to collect spiderwebs that morning&mdash;or rather,
Noxy volunteered them both and Sensy went along with it like always.
Winter had finally turned to spring:
stubborn crusts of snow still lurked in the shadows of the twisted mountain pines,
but the sun shone diamond-bright in a clear blue sky,
and being indoors suddenly seemed unbearable.
Besides,
getting out of the village would give them a chance for a talk
that Noxy thought was long overdue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoo.&rdquo;
She poked a fat brown spider with a stick.
It waved its hairy forelegs at her indignantly before scuttling away to make a new home.
Noxy cut its web&rsquo;s anchor threads with two practiced twists of her knife
and started winding it onto a stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I should put new buttons on my coat?&rdquo; Sensy asked.</p>
<p>Noxy glanced at her.
&ldquo;Why? Are those ones coming loose?&rdquo;
She had been trying for an hour to think of a way to broach the subject of their mutual friend Rash,
who was the only boy their age in the village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they&rsquo;re just kind of plain.&rdquo;
Sensy looked down at her bulky camelskin coat critically.
&ldquo;Granna Fee has some really nice red ones.
She said she&rsquo;d give them to me if I picked the stones out of her pepper garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her whole garden? That would take forever.&rdquo;
Noxy shook the dew off the spider&rsquo;s web
and stuffed it into the loosely-woven bag slung over her shoulder.
&ldquo;Why would you do all that work for buttons you don&rsquo;t need?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re no help,&rdquo; Sensy pouted.
She had spent the winter embroidering red and green patterns on her jacket&rsquo;s cuffs and collar.
All she seemed to want to talk about any more was her clothes and her hair
and who she and Noxy might meet that summer.
The only thing she <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> want to talk about was Rash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of girls are like that when they get their changes,&rdquo;
Granna Fee had said when Noxy had complained about the flighty stranger
who seemed to have taken her best friend&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me!&rdquo; Noxy had declared.</p>
<p>Her grandmother had laughed.
&ldquo;No, sweetling, not you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She and Sensy and Rash had grown up together,
done chores together,
played tag and make-believe in the forest around Stale together,
and learned to mind-speak with clouds together,
but something had changed that winter.
Sometimes Noxy saw Sensy look at Rash,
or Rash look at Sensy,
and then look away as if they felt guilty.
And when they talked to each other,
all they did was bicker.
If her two best friends were mad at one another,
Noxy thought,
it was her job go sort it out.</p>
<p>Noxy slung her bag over her shoulder.
&ldquo;Come on, there&rsquo;s more up on the ridge.&rdquo;
She set off without waiting for an answer.
A moment later Sensy scrambled to catch up with her.</p>
<p>The path was one of dozens that snaked through the evergreen forest surrounding Stale.
Mud made it slippery where it wasn&rsquo;t slick with ice,
but Noxy didn&rsquo;t slow down until she reached the rocky ridge overlooking her home.</p>
<p>Below them lay the ancient walls of the fortress that held the village of Stale.
The centuries had smoothed the edges of the Pilots&rsquo; stonework,
making the fortress look like it was made of snow that was just starting to helt,
but it was still as solid as the mountains themselves.
The villagers&rsquo; two-story wooden houses sheltered inside the walls like ducklings in a nest,
thin licks of smoke rising from their slate chimneys.
Narrow streets wound between camel pens, vegetable plots, and racks laden with drying spiderwebs,
and even from a distance Noxy could hear
the soft musical clang of the windchimes that hung by every door.</p>
<p>To the west the fortress wall dropped straight into a steep-sided gorge.
A net woven from spider thread stretched over its top,
as light as a dream but as strong as steel.
Another net hung down at the gorge&rsquo;s mouth to make a gate.
Inside,
just visible from the ridge,
two gray clouds floated half-asleep.</p>
<p>Noxy had spent every moment she could that winter watching the clouds,
riding them,
and most importantly,
practicing mind-speech with them.
Grownups called Big Blue and Pillow slow and lazy,
but they and the herd of half-wild clouds grazing on the mountain peaks in the distance
were the most exciting things in Noxy&rsquo;s world.</p>
<p>As Noxy pulled her bag off her shoulder,
Sensy grabbed her arm.
&ldquo;Look!&rdquo;  she hissed,
pointing into the trees.</p>
<p>At first all Noxy saw was branches,
but then a pair of dark eyes blinked.
Black fur framed a round face with heavy brows and a gray muzzle.
The troll blinked again and pulled a branch aside with one long, hairy arm.</p>
<p>Noxy and Sensy took a step back, then another,
and froze at a sudden rustling behind them.
Noxy turned her head slowly to look over her shoulder.
A second troll hung by one hand from a branch behind them,
blocking their way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh-what are they doing here?&rdquo; Sensy whispered loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ssh!&rdquo; Noxy said.  &ldquo;Just&hellip; don&rsquo;t&hellip; move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Branches rustled overhead.
Two&mdash;three&mdash;four trolls swung by,
except no,
the fourth didn&rsquo;t by by.
It stopped and looked down at them.
Its fur was shot through with gray,
and even from five strides below it Noxy could see the long hairless scar that ran up the length of its left leg.</p>
<p>Something twinged in the back of her head like the start of one of her headaches.
For a moment it was as if <em>she</em> was in the tree looking down at herself.</p>
<p>A roar broke the stillness.
The gray troll hooted and vanished into the forest.
Noxy and Sensy let out long shaky breaths&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;and shrieked as a tiger burst out of the trees half a dozen strides in front of them.
His fur was yellow-brown with dark brown stripes,
not orange and black like the picture in the book
that three generations of village children had passed around.
A pair of golden earrings hung from his left ear,
and his tail twitched slightly as he looked at them,
as if their presence reminded him that he had not yet eaten lunch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; he rumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh-what?&rdquo; Noxy stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are&hellip; you&hellip; all&hellip; right?&rdquo; the tiger repeated impatiently.
&ldquo;Did those blasted chimpanzees harm you at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they&mdash;I mean, we&rsquo;re all right.
We&rsquo;re fine, thank you very much.
Ouch, Sensy, you&rsquo;re going to break my fingers!&rdquo;
Noxy pulled her hand free from her friend&rsquo;s terrified grip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pilots be praised,&rdquo;
the tiger rumbled,
settling onto his haunches.
&ldquo;Now, if I may ask a favor,
could you be so kind as to direct me to the village of Stale Leftovers?&rdquo;
His ear twitched at the sound of a distant hoot.
&ldquo;Or if perchance you are going that way yourselves,
may I have the honor of accompanying you?
Those creatures will think twice about molesting you
if you have a protector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sensy hitched her bag up on her shoulder.
&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t molest us,&rdquo; she protested.
We&mdash;I mean, the village,
we have an arrangement with them.
The trolls.
We don&rsquo;t go too far into the forest,
and they don&rsquo;t come near the village except for when they want to trade,
and they leave some stones down by the fish pond, and&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>Noxy cut her off with a gesture.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.
Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Kulbinder of Thind,&rdquo; the tiger said, rising to all fours.
&ldquo;And if you will forgive my impatience,
my need is rather pressing.
My companions are in grave danger and need help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noxy shot a look at Sensy.
Her friend shook her head and mouthed &ldquo;no&rdquo;.
That was enough to make up Noxy&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this way,&rdquo; she said, pointing down the path.
&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later they reached the fortress gate.
An enormous slab of stone had once hung there like a door
on hinges made of polished diamond.
The diamonds were long gone,
but a few pieces of the shattered slab still lay half-buried in the ground,
too heavy for mountain camels to pull free.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas was sitting on one of them
whittling a new leg when they came out of the trees.
He raised a hand in greeting,
then swore and clambered to his feet at the sight of the tiger.
&ldquo;Saints and their inventions!&rdquo;
He pointed accusingly with his whittling knife.
&ldquo;What in the underhells is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>This</em> is a who, not a what,&rdquo; Kulbinder replied curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We met him up by the spider grove,&rdquo; Noxy said hurriedly.
&ldquo;There were some trolls, and he scared them off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trolls?&rdquo;
Grappa Gas said skeptically.
&ldquo;What would trolls be doing there?
They haven&rsquo;t come down this far in&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grappa!&rdquo;
Noxy stomped her foot.
&ldquo;Never mind that now!
The tiger says people need our help.
At least, I think they&rsquo;re people,&rdquo;
she added belatedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are that,&rdquo; the tiger confirmed.
&ldquo;Can you take me to your <em>tralpa</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grappa Gas snorted.
&ldquo;Not hardly.
But the reeve&rsquo;s about.
Follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes and a lot of questions later,
the whole village was in the cobbled square&mdash;or rather,
the whole village minus most of the adults,
who had left a week ago for the snowfields to collect Stale&rsquo;s clouds from their winter pasture.
Three hundred people,
from babies to grandparents,
stood in a half-circle around the impatient tiger.
Some still wore the thick coats and pants they used in winter and when cloudherding.
Others,
like Noxy and Sensy,
had switched to lighter clothes
that would still have seemed heavy to anyone unfamiliar with the icy winds of the high mountains.
Grappa Gas&rsquo;s son Aft,
who had been splitting logs to make shingles,
was the only one in shirtsleeves,
but not the only one scowling at the new arrival.</p>
<p>Noxy&rsquo;s mother Indy thumped the speaker&rsquo;s drum three times
and stepped up onto the squared-off stone that marked the center of the square.
&ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; she said loudly,
patting the air with her hands to quiet everyone.
&ldquo;Friends, please.
I know it is early in the year for travelers,
but please, give welcome to Kulbinder, a Gifted of Thind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome&hellip; welcome&hellip; be welcome&hellip;&rdquo;
Some voices were hearty,
some grudging,
and some people didn&rsquo;t speak at all,
but Noxy&rsquo;s mother took it all in stride like she always did.</p>
<p>Someone nudged Noxy&rsquo;s shoulder with their own.
&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Rash said, slipping between her and Sensy.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the <em>tralpa</em>?
Is he too afraid of the tiger to come out and say hello?
Or has he been up all night studying again?&rdquo;
He mimed someone drinking from a bottle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ssh!&rdquo;
But he was right&mdash;the voice and hand of the king in Stale Remainders,
who was also the least useful magician Noxy had ever met,
was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Indy thumped the brightly-painted speaker&rsquo;s drum again.
&ldquo;The Gifted has told me that he and his companions were trying to get through the pass to Chaghan.
An avalanche forced them off the road.&rdquo;
She swept her gaze across the assembled villagers.
&ldquo;They made camp in the trees.
The forest became angry.
Some have died, and the rest are trapped.
They need our help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A murmur ran through the crowd.
The Herd of Trees that blanketed the Brumoso Mountains
guarded its territory as jealously as a mother bear guarded her cubs.
People who stayed near the Pilots&rsquo; ancient roads never came to harm,
and those who ventured deeper were safe in small numbers.
If they made a fire,
though,
or cut a branch from one of the towering redwoods
that Granna Fee cautioned Noxy and her friends to steer clear of on training flights,
the forest&rsquo;s wrath could be as merciless as a winter storm.</p>
<p>Aft elbowed his way to the front of the small crowd.
&ldquo;These companion you&rsquo;re talking about&mdash;are they smugglers?&rdquo;
he asked loudly without waiting for Indy to call on him.</p>
<p>Noxy&rsquo;s mother suppressed an exasperated sigh.
&ldquo;Not that the Gifted has said, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why in the saints&rsquo; names were they trying to get through the pass this time of year?
It&rsquo;ll be another month at least before the high trails clear.&rdquo;
He crossed his muscular arms.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t something folk would do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My companions are not &lsquo;folk&rsquo;,&rdquo;
the tiger said haughtily.
&ldquo;They are soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd murmured again.
&ldquo;Soldiers?&rdquo; Aft said disbelievingly.
&ldquo;What are soldiers doing up here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soldier blinked slowly.
&ldquo;Deserting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well ain&rsquo;t that a bucket of trouble,&rdquo;
Aft said sarcastically as yet another murmur ran through the crowd.
&ldquo;Are you hoping we&rsquo;re going to help you hide out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tiger&rsquo;s tail twitched.
&ldquo;I did not come to your village to hide,
honored.
In truth,
I did not intend to come here at all,
but my companions need help.
You are their only hope&mdash;if you fear it will bring more trouble than you can chew,
say so and I will be on my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody is saying we won&rsquo;t help,&rdquo; Indy said firmly.
&ldquo;And as long as I&rsquo;m reeve, nobody is <em>going</em> to say that.&rdquo;
She raised a hand to cut Aft off before he could speak again.
&ldquo;We can argue about the politics later.
Right now there&rsquo;s folk in trouble,
and I won&rsquo;t have it said that we ever turned our backs on those that needed us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next five minutes were chaos.
Out of the question, Aft said emphatically.
The <em>tralpa</em> might look the other way
if they sheltered a stray who&rsquo;d been stupid enough to anger the forest,
but flying off to rescue a rebel army?
Even he would have to report that.
&ldquo;We have to look to our own,&rdquo;
he finished,
glancing meaningfully at the bulge under his wife Rind&rsquo;s coat.</p>
<p>And what did he think &ldquo;their own&rdquo; were going say
when they got back from rounding up the village&rsquo;s clouds
and found out that the folk who&rsquo;d stayed behind
had left strangers at the forest&rsquo;s mercy,
Grappa Gas shot back.
Father and son glared at each other
with a mutual stubbornness born of long practice.</p>
<p>The argument swirled back and forth across the cobblestones,
punctuated by soft bings and bongs from the village windchimes.
Little whirlpools of disagreement came together,
spun about,
and flew apart as people overheard neighbors they disagreed with,
or turned around to nod ad something they had overheard
and were sucked into yet another &ldquo;what if?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is going to go on forever,&rdquo; Noxy said sourly.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all going to do whatever my <em>amma</em> wants to do in the end.
Why don&rsquo;t they just get on with it?&rdquo;
She, Sensy, and Rash stayed together in a knot on the sidelines,
old enough that they hadn&rsquo;t grown bored and run off to play like the younger children,
but young enough that the discussion seemed vaguely ridiculous.</p>
<p>Rash ran a finger along the lip fuzz he insisted on calling a mustache.
It had become a habit over the winter,
one that Noxy had told him countless times he ought to break
before <em>someone</em> broke his stupid finger.
&ldquo;What I want to know is whether we&rsquo;re going to get to go,
or if we&rsquo;re going to be stuck here with the littles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we&rsquo;ll get to go,&rdquo; Noxy said dismissively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure about that?&rdquo;
Rash raised an eyebrow,
another annoying habit he had cultivated over the winter.
&ldquo;Because your <em>amma</em>&rsquo;s giving jobs to just about everyone except us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noxy puffed an annoyed breath,
biting off her, &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m sure!&rdquo; when at Sensy&rsquo;s uncertain look.
&ldquo;Wait here,&rdquo; she ordered.</p>
<p>She strode through the crowd to the speaker&rsquo;s stone
and caught her mother&rsquo;s eye.
Before Noxy could speak,
Indy said,
&ldquo;Oh, and I think you&rsquo;ve met my daughter, Probably Noxious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The honor was mine,&rdquo; the tiger rumbled,
flicking an ear in what might have been the feline equivalent of a very small bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just call me Noxy,&rdquo; she told him.
&ldquo;<em>Amma</em>, which cloud do you want me and Sensy and Rash on?
We can go and start getting them ready while everyone&rsquo;s still jawing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indy gave her daughter a look that Noxy knew all too well.
&ldquo;Who said anything about you three going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Noxy knew her mother as well as her mother knew her,
and had assembled her arguments as she crossed the square.
They were definitely old enough&mdash;why,
they were all going to be riding <em>real</em> clouds in a few weeks,
not just the tame old pair floating in the cloud pen.
And they wouldn&rsquo;t be going far,
just a few gallops down the pass,
and it was really important for cloudherds to know how to do rescues,
wasn&rsquo;t it?
And&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop.&rdquo;
Her mother held up a hand,
pointedly ignoring the amused look on Granna Fee&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;You can go.  But!&rdquo; she continued,
&ldquo;You do what you&rsquo;re told and nothing more, understood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noxy nodded obediently.
&ldquo;Yes, <em>amma</em>.&rdquo;
She had learned long ago not to keep asking for a whole orange
when she&rsquo;d already talked her mother into a half.</p>
<p>Eventually everyone realized that they agreed with Indy&rsquo;s decision
or were so outnumbered as to make further argument pointless.
Even Aft gave in
on condition that he be given lead on one of the clouds
so that he could keep an eye on things.</p>
<p>After that,
it only took the villagers a few minutes to gather what they needed.
Rockfalls and avalanches were common in the mountains,
and they had lifted more than one tinker or trader out of a difficult spot.
Coils of hemp rope with spider-silk cores hung ready in the long shed next to the cloud pen,
and everyone kept a camelskin cap and some heavy gloves handy just in case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look ridiculous,&rdquo; Noxy told Rash flatly
as he came down the wooden steps to the mounting platform.
He had embroidered a pattern he claimed was eagle&rsquo;s wings
onto the flaps of his cap during the winter,
and was wearing bright orange gloves
that the last of the autumn pack traders had sworn were all the rage in Gandan.</p>
<p>Rash looked her up and down.
&ldquo;Really?  Because I think you look amazing. Excuse me.&rdquo;
He winked and stepped around the speechless fourteen-year-old.</p>
<p>They were the last to arrive at the wooden platform
that hung over the edge of the cloud pen.
&ldquo;Ears all!&rdquo; Aft said loudly.
He had changed into heavy pants,
a padded coat,
and a pair of soft boots,
and his hair was tied back in a thick club braid
with a blue ribbon from his wedding collar for luck.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lead on Pillow with Rash and Sensy as spotters.
Gas and Fee, you&rsquo;re on Blue&mdash;you take Noxy and the Gifted with you.
In and out,
quick and simple,
and everyone&rsquo;s back here for soup before you can sneeze.
No adventures, right?&rdquo;
He glared at Noxy, Sensy, and Rash until the three teenagers mumbled,
&ldquo;No adventures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo;
He walked to the end of the plank that stuck out from the platform
and whistled through his fingers.
When nothing happened,
he muttered something about &ldquo;soggy&rdquo; and &ldquo;lazy&rdquo; and whistled again more loudly.</p>
<p>A hundred strides away and fifty strides below them,
a fog-edged blue-gray mass began to pull itself into
something dense enough to hold a person&rsquo;s weight.
The second,
smaller blob next to it followed suit.
Side by side,
Big Blue and Pillow drifted toward the platform.
A clattering noise further along the ravine signalled that
whoever Indy had sent to pull back the pen&rsquo;s spiderweb gate
had started hauling in the rope-and-bamboo chain it hung from.</p>
<p>Noxy&rsquo;s pulse beat faster as the clouds approached,
their flanks rippling slightly in the wind.
When Big Blue bumped against the ravine wall,
Aft took three steps and jumped off the end of the plank.</p>
<p>Noxy leaned over the railing.
One, two, three&hellip;
Big Blue dimpled as the burly cloudherd tucked,
flipped over,
spread-eagled,
and landed flat on his back.
Gray waves rippled out across the cloud&rsquo;s back
as he rolled over onto his knees and pressed his hands down firmly.
Noxy couldn&rsquo;t see his face,
but she knew his eyes would be closed in concentration as he mind-spoke to his mount.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show-off,&rdquo; Grappa Gas muttered.</p>
<p>Granna Fee elbowed him.
&ldquo;Gets it from his old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something twinged in the back of Noxy&rsquo;s head.
She blinked.
&ldquo;Did you say something?&rdquo; she asked Sensy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;
She and Rash were watching Aft just as intently as Noxy.</p>
<p>Noxy shook her head.
&ldquo;Never mind.
Look, he&rsquo;s coming up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Big Blue rose toward the platform,
bunching into an even firmer mass as he neared them.
Aft had risen to one knee,
but kept one hand on the cloud&rsquo;s back so that he could continue to mind-talk to it.</p>
<p>A silver-winged scaw shot out of its cliffside nest,
cawing its displeasure at the sight of a human just a few strides away.
Aft looked up and smiled as he always did
when he was on cloudback or holding hands with his wife.
With a whoop he ran across across Big Blue&rsquo;s back
and launched himself into the air again.</p>
<p>Rash whistled.
&ldquo;Nice leap,&rdquo; he said appreciatively
as Aft landed dead center on Pillow.
&ldquo;And into the blind, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not such a trick,&rdquo; Noxy said dismissively,
though she was secretly impressed.
&ldquo;He must have got Big Blue to tell him where she was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, but would you trust a cloud&rsquo;s eyes that much?&rdquo;
Rash challenged her.
&ldquo;Most of the time I can&rsquo;t make cheese or cherries out of what they say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noxy shrugged.
She had realized early in their training that
mind-speech was a lot easier for her than it was for Sensy or Rash,
or even for some of the olders who were already riding.
She had stopped talking about it after a few muttered accusations of showing off.
The only person she shared her progress with now was her grandmother,
and even then she didn&rsquo;t tell Granna Fee everything.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas made everyone wait
until Pillow was only a couple of strides below the mounting platform
before he let Sensy and Rash jump.
The teenagers had been doing it since they were children,
but the brief moment of flight and <em>poof!</em> as they landed
still made them whoop.</p>
<p>Aft steered the cow out of the way
so that Big Blue could take her place beneath the plank.
Grappa Gas landed on him with a soft <em>thud</em>.
Granna Fee tossed down two bundles of blankets.
&ldquo;Your turn,&rdquo; she said to Kulbinder.</p>
<p>The tiger&rsquo;s ears lay flat against his skull.
His tail whipped from side to side.
For a moment Noxy thought he was going to refuse,
but with a sudden burst of speed he charged to the end of the plank and jumped.
She and Granna Fee leaned over the railing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; Granna Fee said.
&ldquo;I guess they really do always land on their feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Twinge.</em>
Noxy winced and put her hand on the back of her head.
There it was again, that feeling of&mdash;of <em>something</em>, but what?</p>
<p>Her grandmother noticed her expression.
&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Noxy lied.
One of the grownups&rsquo; many rules was that no one should fly if they were sick,
and she was not about to be left behind.
&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s see if you remember your lessons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheeky,&rdquo; her grandmother said.
Three quick steps and a little hop and she was gone,
leaving Noxy alone on the platform.
She took a deep breath,
grinned,
and sprinted for the end of the plank.</p>
<p>She landed just a stride away from her grandmother,
who was lying flat on her back on the cloud.
&ldquo;Oof,&rdquo; Granna Fee grunted,
rolling over and sitting up.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not as soft as he used to be.&rdquo;
Then she smiled and put her arm around Noxy
so that her granddaughter could lean against her
as she pressed her hand against Big Blue and closed her eyes.
The cloud turned obediently and began drifting toward the mouth of the gorge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take lead,&rdquo; Aft called back through cupped hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really? How unusual of you,&rdquo;
Granna Fee said just loudly enough to make Noxy grin.
She steered Big Blue into position behind the smaller cow.</p>
<p>As they neared the gate,
Aft took the ox horn from his belt and blew three loud notes.
Indy blew an answering note
as the two clouds passed through the gate and into the pass.</p>
<p>Cloudherding is cold work, even in the summer.
In the spring,
when every breath instantly turns to fog
and the wind pokes its fingers through every loose seam and down every collar,
it&rsquo;s freezing.
As they left the cloud pen behind,
Granna Fee took a camel hair blanket from the nearest bundle
and wrapped it around herself and Noxy,
leaving only their faces exposed.
Up ahead,
Noxy saw that Rash and Sensy had done the same&mdash;as Sensy had said more than once,
he might be a goof,
but at least he was a <em>warm</em> goof.</p>
<p>Only Grappa Gas seemed unaffected.
&ldquo;Saints and their inventions,
but I love this,&rdquo; he sighed.
He&rsquo;d brought a cushion to rest his wooden leg on
so that it wouldn&rsquo;t poke into Big Blue,
but a long scarf only slightly less colorful than Rash&rsquo;s gloves
was his only concession to the freezing temperature.
&ldquo;Look, the condors are back in their nest!
We should invite them them to visit some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not really the most sociable creatures,&rdquo;
Granna Fee said dryly.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas harrumphed.
&ldquo;You just have to get to know them.
I wonder if any of their chicks will be Gifted this year?
That would be a thing, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It had taken the tiger a day to make his way up the pass to Stale Leftovers.
Even with the headwind,
the clouds covered the same distance in half an hour.
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; Granna Fee said, pointing at a thin plume of smoke.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas frowned, then looked at Kulbinder.
&ldquo;I thought you said there were just a few of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fewer than we started with,&rdquo; the tiger growled.
He had spent the flight crouched down to get out of the wind,
his legs and tail tucked underneath his body.
Now he stood and padded forward to join Granna Fee at Big Blue&rsquo;s leading edge.</p>
<p>The soldiers&rsquo; makeshift camp sat on a barren pinnacle of rock
that rose out of the forest like an island.
A dozen drab tents huddled around a small fire.
Shading her eyes with her hand,
Noxy saw a dozen men moving about,
some leaning against one another to stay upright.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas gave a low whistle.
&ldquo;The <em>tralpa</em> really isn&rsquo;t going to like this,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind him,&rdquo; Granna Fee replied.
&ldquo;What do you think my daughter is going to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the soldiers spotted them a moment later.
They were too far away to hear his shout,
but there was no mistaking the urgency in the way he waved his arms
or in the way his companions hurried to roust their injured comrades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your eyes wide,&rdquo; Grappa Gas ordered Noxy curtly.
&ldquo;Forest might be happy to let us take them, or it might not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t.
An angry voice cawed behind them.
A hundred more answered it.
All at once they were surrounded by a flock of gray crows,
each one an angry feathered missile with sharp claws and a pecking beak.</p>
<p>Noxy screamed as a crow grabbed her hair.
Another took hold of her collar and pecked her shoulder.
She screamed again,
swatting at them as Granna Fee and Grappa Gas yelled and did the same.</p>
<p>The tiger&rsquo;s roar sent the birds wheeling back into the air.
Noxy slapped at her hair one last time,
then spun around at a faint shout from up ahead
as the flock descended on the other three cloudherds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get off! Get off me!&rdquo; Aft shouted,
spinning the end of a coil of rope over his head to keep them at bay
while Sensy and Rash batted at any bird that came too close.
The crows swirled around them for a dozen heartbeats before veering away again.</p>
<p>Aft handed the rope to Rash and knelt to press his hands against Pillow.
A moment later he looked up and shook his head grimly.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s terrified,&rdquo; he bellowed through cupped hands.
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t go any closer.  We have to leave them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Underhells with that,&rdquo; Grappa Gas muttered.
&ldquo;Fee&mdash;I&rsquo;ll get Blue down there.
You &lsquo;n&rsquo; Noxy get &lsquo;em loaded up fast as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; Granna Fee protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; Grappa Gas bellowed as they went into a dive.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to get bumpy!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p>No one said much on the way back to Stale.
With her hand on Big Blue,
Noxy could feel how unhappy the cloud was.
It wasn&rsquo;t just that he was carrying strangers
or that those strangers were wounded and weary.
When clouds died they just spread out into nothing.
The thought that something could end but still be there&mdash;that
it could go from being alive to being like a rock or a log&mdash;made
the canvas-wrapped corpses on the cloud&rsquo;s back frightening
in a way that storm winds and lightning would never be.</p>
<p><em>Sh, sh, sh,</em> Noxy mind-spoke soothingly,
stroking the cloud as if he was a newborn camel.
<em>Home soon, then you can have the biggest steam bath ever.</em>
She wanted one just as much as the cloud.</p>
<p>The soldiers watched the mountains go by,
too exhausted to show more than an occasional flicker of interest
in the mountains around them or the wilderness below.
The one who had been last on
spoke quietly to each of his companions in turn.
The young soldier with the scarred face sat beside the tiger
with his chin resting on his knees
and his brightly-painted battle mask pushed up on top of his head.</p>
<p>Noxy cleared her throat.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about your friends,&rdquo; she said hesitantly.</p>
<p>Soldier and tiger turned their heads in unison to look at her.
The boy nodded.
&ldquo;Thank you, honored,&rdquo; he said,
his lowland accent burring his r&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;And thank you for coming to our aid.&rdquo;
He put his chin back on his knees and wiped his eyes with his sleeve.
Beside him,
the tiger rumbled something too low for Noxy to hear.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas set Big Blue down in front of the fortress gate
where he had been contentedly whittling only an hour before.
The soldiers slid wearily off the cloud&rsquo;s back
to stand among the bright green ferns of spring.
The waiting villagers came forward to offer them blankets and then stepped back,
unsure what to do next.</p>
<p>Indy didn&rsquo;t let them stand idle for long&mdash;she never did.
&ldquo;Get everyone up into the traders&rsquo; hall,&rdquo; she ordered crisply.
&ldquo;And get a couple of pots of stew going&mdash;and tea.
Lot of tea.
You do drink tea, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she asked the nearest soldier.</p>
<p>Rash and Sensy came up the trail from the cloud pen where Aft had taken Pillow.
&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; Sensy asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Noxy lied.
&ldquo;But those crows&mdash;that was horrible.
And the squirrels.
I&rsquo;ve never seen the forest that angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never want to again,&rdquo; Sensy said, shivering.</p>
<p>Rash nudged her shoulder with his.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the tiger gone?&rdquo; he asked Noxy.</p>
<p>A terrified shout from inside the ancient walls was his answer.
A moment later the village <em>tralpa</em> stumbled through the gate,
tripping over the hem of the formal lowland-style robe he insisted on wearing.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s&mdash; there&rsquo;s a&mdash; Reeve!  Reeve!
What is <em>that creature</em> doing here?&rdquo;
He snapped his fingers.
A tiny spark sputtered and died in the palm of his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saints give me strength,&rdquo; Noxy&rsquo;s mother muttered.
Granna Fee rolled her eyes at Noxy
as Indy put on the smile she used when talking to people she didn&rsquo;t like
and turned to face the king&rsquo;s official representative in Stale Leftovers.</p>
<p>Scholar-Candidate Nangyal insisted that the villagers use his full title
despite being a decade past the age
when most magicians were able to drop the word &ldquo;candidate&rdquo;.
He looked as though he had slept in his robe and only just woken up,
which he probably had.
Like the soldiers who did their best to straighten up
when they caught sight of his official gray scarf,
he had a lowlander&rsquo;s round face and near-black skin.
But where they were lean he sagged,
and where they had only a few days of stubble on their shaved heads,
his frizzy hair and failed beard
were as unruly as the ferns he trampled as he strode over to Indy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reeve, are you aware that there is an <em>animal</em> in the village?&rdquo;
he demanded icily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Gifted, Scholar-Candidate,&rdquo; she replied.
&ldquo;His name is Kulbinder.
He arrived this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why was I not informed?  And who are <em>these</em> people?&rdquo;
he continued without waiting for an answer.
He jabbed a finger at the soldier who had been the last up onto Big Blue.
&ldquo;You!  Sergeant!  What are you doing here?
Just look at your uniform&mdash;it&rsquo;s a disgrace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soldier nodded.
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t quite regimental standard, is it, honored?&rdquo; he acknowledged ruefully.
&ldquo;Nothing a bar of soap won&rsquo;t put right, though.
I&rsquo;ll see to it once my men are settled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Settled?&rdquo;
The <em>tralpa</em> looked from the sergeant to his men and back to the sergeant.
His sour look brightened to merely displeased.
&ldquo;Well, <em>finally</em>.
This is long overdue.
<em>Long</em> overdue,&rdquo; he repeated,
nodding in agreement with himself.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been writing letters for <em>months</em>.
No offense to His Majesty,
of course,
but I don&rsquo;t think people realize just how strategically important this pass is.
And the clouds&mdash;why, if those upstart peasants
were to somehow gain control of them,
there&rsquo;s no telling what might&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>The sergeant cleared his throat.
&ldquo;Actually, honored, it wasn&rsquo;t His Majesty who sent us.&rdquo;
Noxy&rsquo;s breath caught caught
as one of the soldiers positioned himself behind Nangyal,
his hand falling to the hilt of his sword.</p>
<p>The whole village held its breath.
One heartbeat, two&hellip;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re&mdash;you&rsquo;re <em>traitors</em>!?&rdquo; the <em>tralpa</em> spluttered.
&ldquo;Here!?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face screwed up
as if he was having a particularly difficult visit to the outhouse,
and for a moment Noxy wondered if he might actually manage to cast a spell.
He had worked day and night when he first arrived in Stale two years ago
to master enough to pass the annual examinations in the capital.
&ldquo;And be posted somewhere with <em>restaurants</em>,&rdquo;
he was heard to mutter more than once.
But his flames were just sparks
and his lights barely glimmers,
so now he spent most of his time alone in the biggest house in the village
with his bottles and his books.</p>
<p>But no.
Instead,
the <em>tralpa</em> pointed imperiously at the sergeant.
&ldquo;Reeve!  Arrest these men immediately!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; &ldquo;No!&rdquo; Indy and the sergeant said simultaneously.
The sergeant shook his head almost imperceptibly at the soldier behind the <em>tralpa</em>.
Obediently,
the man slid his half-drawn sword back into its sheath.</p>
<p>The sergeant turned to Indy.
&ldquo;Honored?
If you don&rsquo;t want us here, we&rsquo;ll go, but we won&rsquo;t suffer arrest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s arresting anybody,&rdquo; she said firmly.
&ldquo;Not today, anyway.
No&mdash;with respect, Scholar-Candidate,
these men are travelers.
They need our help,
and we need to lay their dead to rest before they ghost.
Sergeant&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry, I don&rsquo;t know your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dorbu, honored&mdash;Gandan&rsquo;s Ninety-Eighth Dorbu,&rdquo;
the sergeant replied,
dipping his head respectfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sergeant Dorbu,&rdquo; Indy continued
in a this-is-how-it&rsquo;s-going-to-be voice
that left no room for disagreement,
&ldquo;Do you promise that you and your men will take no action against His Majesty
while you&rsquo;re our guests?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have my word, honored,&rdquo; the sergeant said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mine,&rdquo; Kulbinder rumbled,
&ldquo;Since I am not, as the <em>tralpa</em> so quickly observed, a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noxy jumped.
The tiger had padded up behind them all while they were talking.</p>
<p>The <em>tralpa</em> stumbled backed a step,
tripping over the hem of his robe once again.
&ldquo;What?
No!
Reeve, I <em>order</em> you to arrest these men!
And this creature!
They are <em>rebels</em>!
They are <em>traitors</em>!
I, I <em>insist</em>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu sighed,
unbuckled his sword belt,
and held it out to Indy.
The reeve blinked.
&ldquo;What am I supposed to do with this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever you want,&rdquo; the soldier said.
&ldquo;And lock me up if you want.
Just make sure someone looks after my men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I just said, that won&rsquo;t be necessary,&rdquo; Indy replied tartly.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just get everyone warmed up and fed, shall we?
It&rsquo;s an hour until sunset&mdash;we&rsquo;ll put your dead to rest
and then we can all get some sleep and sort this out in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <em>tralpa</em> drew himself up.
&ldquo;That is <em>unacceptable</em>!&rdquo; he spat.
&ldquo;These men have taken arms against His Majesty!
You!&rdquo;
He pointed at Grappa Gas.
&ldquo;In the king&rsquo;s name,
I hereby appoint you acting reeve.
Arrest these men and then arrest <em>her</em>!&rdquo;
He swivelled his arm to point accusingly at Indy.</p>
<p>Grappa Gas had been stroking Big Blue&rsquo;s flank,
mind-speaking to the old bull to calm him.
He looked from the indignant <em>tralpa</em> to the reeve
and back to the <em>tralpa</em>.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t do that, honored,&rdquo;
he said cheerfully.
&ldquo;I have to get this old boy back in his pen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sergeant Dorbu&rsquo;s shoulders slumped slightly.
&ldquo;Thank you, honored,&rdquo; he said to Indy,
buckling his sword back on.
With a grunt,
he squatted and lifted one of the canvas bundles onto his shoulder.
&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s somewhere we could&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you the way,&rdquo; Granna Fee said quietly.</p>
<!--

The *tralpa* stormed and raged for a few moments longer, but once he realized
that no one was paying attention he wrapped his robe and what was left of his
dignity around himself and marched back the house that he shared with his books,
his bottles, his failed attempts at magic, and his resentment of everyone and
everything outside the distant capital.

Noxy barely noticed his door slam.  Once the soldiers who were well enough had
picked up their comrades' bodies, and the rest had been led through the gate to
have their injuries tended to, and Rash and Sensy went to find spare blankets
for the soldiers, she somehow found herself alone.  Feeling somewhat deflated,
she went looking for something to do.

Her mother was still organizing people in the square.  Yes, the soldiers would
use the trading hall, she'd already said that.  Yes, the wounded too---where
else would they go?  And yes, there *were* more than a few of them, but there
was nothing they could do about that now.  Oh for the saints' sakes, of *course*
they would eat beans.  And no, she didn't know what the tiger was planning to
eat, but she would find out.

"There you are," she said when she caught sight of her daughter.  "Can you
please go home and make some tea?  Use all the honey we have left, and tell
whoever shows up that I'll be there as soon as I can."

The water hadn't even boiled before Grappa Gas rapped on the door with his
knuckles and entered.  "Hey there.  Where's your *amma*?"

"She should be back soon," Noxy said.  She added a handful of dark brown leaves
to the cinnamon bark and green cardamom pods already in the pot.  It was an
extravagance---the pack traders who brought such delicacies to the village
wouldn't start visiting until the last of the snow had melted, which was at
least another month away---but Granna Fee had always said that a sweet cup of
tea was worth a thousand words.

"Mind if I sit?"  Grappa Gas asked as he settled himself on a stool that was at
least as old as he was and watched Noxy drizzle the last of the honey into the
pot.

"What did you find out?" she asked after a moment.

The old man snorted affectionately.  "Just like your *amma*, aren't you? And
your granna, too.  Always thinking one step ahead of everyone else.  You know,
if your granna hadn't been so smart, I might've wound up being your grappa.  I
remember once when---"

"Grappa!" Noxy cut in, exasperated and amused by his teasing at the same time.
"Tell me what the soldiers said!"

"And how do you know they said anything?" Grappa Gas challenged.

"Because they're a long way from home, and tired, and frightened even if they
don't let it show, and want us to like them," Indy answered, closing the door
behind her as she came in.  "And because I saw you talking the ear off Sergeant
Dorbu on your way into the trading hall.  Now, what did he say?  And how in the
saints' names did a bunch of the king's soldiers wind up *here*?"  She kissed
the old man on his grizzled cheek and sat on the other stool.

For a moment all Grappa Gas could think of was how alike mother and daughter
were.  Noxy's hair was brown and wavy like her father's instead of straight and
black like her mother's, and her nose sharper than was common among the
mountain-born, but they had the same strong wills and quick minds.  When Indy
had turned ten, he had predicted that she would be reeve before she was thirty.
*Better start telling everyone that Noxy's going to beat that,* he thought.

He slurped his tea, then cradled the warm mug in his hands.  "The sergeant said
that they were posted over on the border with Lhabde.  There's been heavy snow
this winter, so they were stuck in their barracks most of the time and got to
talking, and..."  He shrugged.  "One thing led to another, I guess.  By the time
the snow had melted enough that they can get on the road, some of 'em said they
weren't going to fight their own neighbors.  Their colonel didn't take well to
that, so he hanged a couple of them, and that helped the rest figure out which
side they wanted to be on."

"So why were they trying to come through the pass?" Indy asked.

Grappa Gas shrugged again.  "They were supposed to be headed down to the
capital, but the king's men hit them at the ford near Duck Droppings.  They were
split cross the two sides of the river when the attack came."  For a moment his
years showed on his face.  "He doesn't expect he'll see many of his friends
again."

Indy glanced at Noxy.  "That doesn't go out of this house," she ordered.  Noxy
nodded, turning to the stove as the lid on the kettle began to whistle.  She
lifted it carefully with a pair of chopsticks to pour the boiling water into the
teapot, then put the kettle back on the stove and set the tea on the table to
steep.

"Was there anything else?" Indy asked.

The front door banged open before he could answer.  Aft strode in and glared at
Indy.  "What in the underhells do you think you're doing?" he demanded.

"Well, good day to you too, son," Grappa Gas drawled, leaning back and lacing
his fingers behind his head.

Aft stabbed a finger toward him.  "Stow that.  Indy, this is madness.  I don't
like the *tralpa* any more than anyone else, but as soon as he gets word down
the mountain that we've gone over to the scoffing rebels---"

"Stop," Indy said sharply.  She stood up and gestured at her stool.  "Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.  And then take a deep breath before you using
language like that in this house again.  We have *not* gone over to anything.
We are not taking any side in this, not as long as I'm reeve.  Noxy?  Go get the
peeling stool from out back.  Brush it off before you bring it in the house."

Aft glowered at her and his father a moment longer, then sat, the stool creaking
in protest under his weight.  Noxy hastily fetched the spare stool from the rear
of the house and set it down for her mother, then poured tea as inconspicuously
as she could while Aft ticked points off on his fingers.  What would the village
do if the king sent an army after the rebels?  And by "if", he meant "when",
because the *tralpa* was sure to be writing another one of his letters while
they were sitting there, and this one would surely get an answer.  They couldn't
fight, not with most of the adults gone, and even once they were back, there
weren't more than a handful of people in the village who'd ever swung a sword,
not that they actually had any swords to swing.  They'd be lucky not to wind up
in prison, and even if they didn't, the village would be paying double taxes for
the next hundred years.

"So what do think we should do?" Grappa Gas challenged.  "Turn them out?  They
wouldn't make it more'n a couple of gallops before they froze or the forest tore
'em apart.  I can just hear what folk would say if we did that.  Or maybe you
think we can take 'em prisoner?"  He mimed swinging a sword.

"Enough."  Indy set her mug down with a thump.  "Enough, both of you.  We have a
stormload of trouble to fly through, and I will *not* have you two making it
worse with your bickering."  She stared into her tea as if hoping the tiny
swirling leaves might spell out some answers.  "I know it's a big thing," she
went on quietly.  "And I did think about turning them away, but Gas is
right---they wouldn't even make it to Rancid.  How would that make us look?"

Aft scowled.  "What people think won't matter much once the king hears about
this.  No, wait, hear me out.  Saving travelers who got caught on the mountain,
well, we can explain that if we have to.  But letting them stay here---saints
and all their gifts, Indy, what'll they do to us?  What'll they do to *her*?"
He jabbed his finger at Noxy.

"And what about the tiger?" he continued before Indy could reply.  "What are we
supposed to feed it?  Or should I ask 'who'?"

"Disgusting Aftertaste!" Indy snapped.  "I will *not* have that kind of talk
about one of the Gifted.  Especially not in front of my daughter."

"Just saying," Aft muttered.  He swallowed the last of his tea in one gulp and
stood up.  "Just think about it, all right?"  He squeezed his strong hands into
impotent fists, then turned and left without saying goodbye.

"Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad thing if he *did* eat some of us!" Grappa Gas
called after him.  "Maybe we'd have some peace and quiet around here!"

He turned back to Indy.  "Don't worry about him.  He's just worried about the
baby.  Everyone gets wound up their first time."

"I know," Indy smiled.  With their first baby due in just a few weeks, Aft and
his wife Rind had stayed behind when the other adults left for the mountains to
gather the village's herd.  The double weight of becoming a father and not being
up in his element had made him as fidgety as a young camel in springtime.

Grappa Gas drained the last of his own tea.  "It's good," he told Noxy
appreciatively.  "Maybe wants more cinnamon next time, though."

"I'll try to remember," Noxy promised.

Indy stood when Grappa Gas did.  "Will you stay for dinner?"

He shook his head.  "Thanks, girl, but I promised your mother I'd, um, peel her
potatoes."  He winked, ignoring Noxy's little 'eww' of disgust.  Indy smiled and
kissed him on the cheek again.  He was humming as he stumped out the door.

Noxy waited until her mother said down again before saying, "*Amma*...?"

"Yes, sweetling?"

Noxy hesitated.  She didn't know where to start.  "Do you think the king really
will send an army after them?"

Indy laughed wearily.  "Probably not a whole army.  But they won't be here long
enough for us to have to worry about that."

Mother and daughter sat in silence for a moment.  Finally Indy stretched.  "So
tell me, did you collect any spiderwebs, or did you and Sensy spend the whole
day mooning after Rash?"

"*Amma*! And how can you think about spiderwebs on a day like this?  And anyway,
nobody's mooning after Rash."  She sighed.  "He and Sensy are hardly talking to
each other right now.  I think they had some kind of fight, but I haven't had a
chance to sort it out."

Her mother shook her head.  "It isn't your job to sort them out.  Maybe you
should just---"

*Crash!* They jumped as something landed on the roof above their heads, sending
loose cedar shingles skittering.

"What in the names...?"  Indy crossed the floor in three steps and threw open
the door just as a troll landed in the narrow street in front of their house.
She yelped and flung herself to the side as the hairy creature lunged past her
and scrambled up the stairs on all fours.

With a roar, the tiger burst into the kitchen and skidded to a stop.  "Which way
did it go?" he demanded, his ears back and his tail lashing.

The sound of a door banging upstairs answered his question before Indy could.
"Wait!" she shouted as the tiger took the steps three at a time.  "Blast!" they
heard him roar.  "The blighter's gone through the window!"

Indy slammed the door shut and stepped in front of it as the tiger raced back
down the stairs.  "Let me pass!" the tiger snarled.

"What in the saints' names are you *doing*?" Indy demanded.

"He was spying on us!" the tiger spat.  "Now let... me... pass!"

"No!" The mayor of Stale glared at him.  "This is *our* village, and you will
*not* race around like a madman!"

It was the bravest thing Noxy had ever seen her mother do, and for one horrible
moment, she was afraid it would be the last.  The muscles in the tiger's
shoulders bunched---and then relaxed.  "Hardly a mad *man*, honored," he
rumbled, as calmly as if he was commenting on her taste in teapots.

Whatever Indy might have said in response was forestalled by a tentative knock
on the door at her back.  The tiger twitched his whiskers.  "Are you going to
answer that?"

Indy waited precisely as long as it would take Noxy to count to ten in her head,
then turned and opened the door.  "Yes?"

The young soldier with the scarred face saluted.  "Excuse me, honored," he
panted, "But I'm looking for---oh.  There you are.  Sorry, honored, I couldn't
keep up.  Did you catch him?"

"No," the tiger growled.  "It turns out that these houses have windows.  Did you
see which way the other one went?"

The young soldier shook his head.  He wasn't much older than she was, Noxy
realized.  "Sorry, honored, I didn't."

The tiger's tail twitched.  "Reeve?  Any idea why a mob of chimpanzees would be
creeping around the village?"

"We call them trolls here, thank you," Indy said, her voice full of polite
steel.  "They're our neighbors.  And I imagine they were doing what any neighbor
would do if a bunch of strangers showed up next door---having a look to see
what's going on."

"There were some trolls up by the spiderweb orchard this morning," Noxy said,
immediately wishing she hadn't when three heads turned to look at her.  "They
stopped Sensy and me when we were coming back down."

"This morning? Why didn't tell me?" her mother demanded.

"It's been kind of busy!" Noxy said defensively.  "Anyway, they were all bigger
than this one.  I think," she amended.

The tiger's tail twitched.  "Big or small, they steer well clear of settlements
in Thind."

"They do here as well," Indy said, beckoning the young soldier to come in as she
spoke.  "We've had an arrangement with them for, oh, I don't know how long.
They keep to the deep forest, we stay out of it, and every fall a few of their
Gifted show up to trade whatever odds and ends they have for some dried fruit or
candy."

"Hrrm."  The tiger's tail twitched again.  "If they saw soldiers on the road,
would they tell you?  Or us?"

Indy shook her head.  "Only if they were in trouble, and even then they wouldn't
do it if the forest was angry.  As you discovered," she added to the soldier,
who had come two steps into the kitchen.

On impulse, Noxy stuck out her hand.  "Hi, I'm Probably Noxious, but everyone
calls me Noxy."

The soldier blinked, glanced at the tiger, and then gave her hand a single firm
shake.  "Private Thokmay, honored.  Thank you for rescuing us."

"I'm glad we could help," Noxy said.  "And---I'm sorry for your loss.  Your
losses," she amended.

The soldier dipped his head.  "Thank you, honored."  He glanced at the tiger.

"We should see if the sergeant needs any help with preparations," he said,
rising to all fours.

"Of course," Indy said, her voice warm once again.  "Please let him know that
we'll be there at sundown.  And if there's anything we can do to help..."

The tiger's boy stepped aside to let the great cat pass, then dipped his head to
Indy and Noxy once again before following his master.  Noxy closed the door
behind them and let out her breath in a long whoosh.  "Well," she said, "That
wasn't scary at all."

Her mother sat back down on her stool and squeezed her daughter's hand.  "Hardly
at all," she agreed.  "Are you all right?"

Noxy's response was somewhere between a snort and a laugh.  Her mother squeezed
her hand again.  "Good.  How would you feel about scrambled eggs tonight?"  She
took down their frying pan without waiting for an answer and set it on the stove
beside the kettle.

"Are you going to go and help them...?" Noxy asked as she began to set the
table, not knowing quite how to finish the sentence.

Her mother glanced at her.  "Help them send off their dead?  Yes.  You don't
have to come if you don't want to."

Noxy shrugged.  "I'll come."

They had two eggs each atop the grilled parsnips left over from the night
before, with stewed snow cabbage and a small onion chopped almost to mush.  They
talked sporadically while they cooked and ate, leaving sentences half-finished
and changing direction like bats chasing bugs on a summer's evening.

When they were done, Indy pushed her plate away and reached across the table to
squeeze her daughter's hand.  "You really can stay here if you want, you know."

Noxy squeezed back.  "I know.  But then who will look after you?"

They dressed for the cold.  Noxy took the box of candles from the shelf beside
the stairs while her mother carefully wound the embroidered gray scarf of her
office around her neck.  With a brief prayer to the named and nameless saints,
Indy lit one of the candles and stood it on the table so that they would come
home to light.  They closed the door gently behind them, brushed their hands
over the windchimes that hung from the eaves to set them ringing, and set off
toward the square.

A handful of other villagers joined them on their way, Grappa Gas and Granna Fee
among them, but no one spoke---the soft sound of windchimes echoing through the
evening said everything that need to be said.  Even the goofs in their pens were
quiet, and the village's cats and raccoons too.  *Probably scared of the tiger,*
Noxy thought.  She certainly was.

When they reached the square, they found the soldiers well enough to stand
waiting, patient and quiet in the way of people who have met sorrow before and
know that they will meet it again.  They had cleaned their armor, or nearly, and
what bandages were in evidence were fresh.  Kulbinder and Private Thokmay stood
a little to the side, the young soldier's hand resting on the nape of the
tiger's neck.  He withdrew it when Noxy nodded to him in greeting, but returned
her nod.  The tiger merely blinked.

In silence, the small crowd made their way through the gate and up the path that
led to the village's worship circle.  Sergeant Dorbu and two other soldiers had
piled pitch-smeared logs on the heavy gray stone that lay at the circle's
center, then laid the bodies of their fallen friends atop the logs.  They stood
at attention as people shuffled into a circle, their battle masks raised to show
their stony expressions.  No one spoke except the smallest children, who were
immediately hushed.

Noxy scanned the crowd, hoping to see Rash or Sensy, but neither was there.
"Where's the *tralpa*?"  she whispered to her mother.  *And where is Aft?* she
wondered.  The big cloudherd often led the villagers' Purplesday worship, but
tonight he was nowhere to be seen.

"Ssh!" As the last corner of the sun disappeared behind the peaks, Indy nodded
to the sergeant.  Saluting in return, he took a flint from a pouch on his belt,
drew his sword, and scraped sparks onto the nearest log.

The crowd held its breath.  The first tiny flame hesitated a moment, then began
to spread.  Everyone exhaled with relief.  There would be no unquiet ghosts to
trouble the villagers and the dead men's comrades.  The soldiers' spirits would
rest.

As dark smoke wrote its message of loss and grief on the sky, Sergeant Dorbu
cleared his throat.  "When I die, I shall give back to the world all that I did
not do.  All that I might have been and wasn't, all the things I lost and spent
and wasted, I shall give them back to the lives that haven't been lived yet.
That will be my thanks to those I loved, and to the world that gave me the
life."

Around him, soldiers and villagers bowed their heads and murmured, "That will be
my thanks." In ones and twos they stepped forward to light candles from the
funeral flames, then turned toward home.  One of the soldiers wept openly and
without shame.  Noxy saw Private Thokmay wipe tears from his cheek and then
straighten his back and square his shoulders, cupping his candle to shelter it
from the wind so that it could in turn be his shield against the darkness.

It was as solemn a moment as she could remember, which is why her heart sank
when they rounded the corner and saw the *tralpa* standing in front of the gate
with a dayglass lantern at his feet, his frizzy hair combed and tied back, and
his scarf of office folded precisely into place.  In one hand he held a book so
thick it was almost a cube.  Tiny flames danced across the fingertips of the
other, and Noxy wondered how many tries it had taken him to make that simple
spell work.

"Oh no," Granna Fee breathed beside her.  "Not now.  Not *now*."

As the villagers approached, Scholar-Candidate Nangyal puffed out his chest.
"Literally Indigestible, by election from its inhabitants and with the consent
of His Majesty Denpa King Gandan made reeve of the village of Stale Leftovers,
come forward!"

Ten strides ahead of Noxy and her grandmother, Indy handed her candle to
Sergeant Dorbu with a quiet, "Thank you."  She waited a moment for the soldiers
and villagers behind her to come to a halt, and another for the whispers to grow
still.  "This is not the time or place, Scholar-Candidate," she said, her voice
carrying clearly on the cold evening breeze.

But the *tralpa* plowed on.  "As the king's voice in this place, I require you,
Literally Indigestible, to answer to a charge of insubordination."  He flicked
his hand a couple of times to blow out the flames he had summoned and then
opened his book, cursing under his breath and stooping to pick up the bookmark
that fluttered to the ground.  Tucking it under his arm, he raised the book with
both hands to show a page that was almost black with dense print.

"I'm sorry, Scholar-Candidate, but that's a bit difficult to read in this
light," Indy said calmly.  "Perhaps we could make some tea and---"

"As the king's voice in this place," the *tralpa* continued loudly, "I require
you also to answer to an additional charge of derelection of duty, inasmuch as
you have---damn it."  The bookmark slipped out from under his arm and fluttered
to the ground again.  "Inasmuch as you have neglected a *direct order* to arrest
those who have freely admitted that they are in open rebellion against His
Majesty."

Before Indy could reply, Sergeant Dorbu stepped forward.  "Am I going to have to
put this down, honored?" he asked gently, raising his candle slightly, its
delicate yellow flame protected by his cupped hand.

The *tralpa* snapped his book shut.  "I do *not* hear the words of traitors," he
said haughtily.

"I see.  Honored, could you take this please?" The sergeant handed his candle to
Indy, ignoring her startled protest, and in one smooth motion drew his sword and
straightened his arm to point its tip at the *tralpa*'s heart.

The Scholar-Candidate's eyes widened.  Noxy's heart skipped a beat.  She had
just enough time to think, *He really thought everyone would just do what he
said,* before someone cleared their throat behind her and said, "Excuse me,
honored?  If I may?"

Ignoring the tiger's growl of, "Not now, boy," Private Thokmay came forward to
join the sergeant and the reeve.  "Did I hear correctly that you're the king's
voice here?" he asked, his voice carrying clearly like that of an actor on
stage.

The *tralpa* nodded jerkily, his eyes fixed on the tip of the sergeant's sword.
"So you're in charge of leases on His Majesty's laws?"  Another jerky nod.
"Well, in that case..."  The young soldier fished a coin out of his pocket.
"There's a law regarding delays in application of official regulations, isn't
there---somewhere near the end of the section on procedures?  I'd like to rent
it, please."

He held out the coin.  The pudgy man gaped at him.  "What?"

"I'd like to rent that law," Private Thokmay continued doggedly.  "Just for
tonight.  That will mean the reeve isn't breaking any of the others if she waits
until tomorrow to arrest people, won't it?"

The *tralpa* looked from the boy to the sergeant's sword to the reeve and back.
"I---yes, I should think so," he replied weakly.

"Thank you, honored."  He paused.  "You have to actually take the coin for this
to be legal, don't you?"

The *tralpa* swallowed, then snatched the coin from the private's hand, picked
up his lantern, and scurried through the fortress gate.  Behind her, Noxy heard
the villagers sigh collectively with relief.

But not the sergeant.  He slammed his sword back into its sheath and turned on
Private Thokmay.  "Don't. Ever. Do. That. Again," he said, every word coming out
cold, clipped, and clear.

"Sorry, honored," Private Thokmay, startled.  "I just thought---"

"What you did is exactly what we're fighting *against*!" the sergeant snapped.
"Those laws he was holding?  They belong to everyone.  Nobody should have to pay
to use them---not here, not now, not *ever*!"

"Sorry, honored," the young soldier said, standing at attention.  "No excuse,
honored.  It won't happen again."

His mouth snapped shut as Indy stepped in front of him and held out her hand to
the sergeant.  "Give it to me.  *Now.*"

Sergeant Dorbu stared at her for a moment, then unbuckled his sword belt for a
second time and held it out.  Indy took it from him with an icy, "Thank you."
She handed it to Grappa Gas without looking at him.  "I will let your men keep
theirs," she said, her voice colder than the mountain breeze, "But only on the
understanding that there will *not* be another incident like this one.  Do we
have an understanding?"

Sergeant Dorbu dipped his head.  "My apologies, honored, I---"

"I don't want your apologies," Indy said in a low voice that sent a shiver up
Noxy's spine.  "I want you to say 'yes, honored'.  Now, do we have an
understanding?"

The sergeant straightened up.  "Yes, honored."

"Good.  Then let's all get a good night's sleep and hope that tomorrow is a
better day for all of us.  Noxy?  It's time for bed."  And with her back as
straight as any soldier's, she marched past the sergeant and the tiger's boy.
Noxy hurryied to keep up with, wondering if her mother had always been this
brave and if every sword was as heavy and awkward as the one she was carrying.

*Noxy had a dream that night.  She often had dreams, or told herself stories in
her head while she was waiting to fall asleep that as often as not turned into
dreams.  Sometimes, when her stories were particularly exciting, she'd mutter
bits of dialog out loud until her mother said, "Who are you talking to?"  and
Noxy would say, "No one," and roll over and pull the blanket up under her chin
and close her eyes and carry on saving the prince from the magician or the
magician from the prince or both of them from an avalanche.*

*But that night's dream wasn't one of those.  She didn't swoop down at the last
moment on a cloud moments ahead of a roaring wave of snow.  She didn't do battle
with an angry pack of lightnings armed only with her courage and a magic sword
while Rash and Sensy and the rest of the village cheered her on.*

*No, this dream wasn't one of those. This one was troubled and strange.  The
tiger was in it, as large as a house.  The crows were in it too, but they were
skeletons decorated with feathers like the toys children made for All Ghosts'
Night and they were pecking chunks out of the people around her who were slowly
losing shape like weary clouds.*

*Standing in the middle of everything was the troll she had seen that morning
with same silver-shot fur and the long scar on her leg.  Her eyes were as deep
as the shadows in the forest where the last of the winter snow could lie
unmelted until midsummer.  She waited patiently until the last of the crows had
flown away and then raised a hand in greeting.*

*Heart pounding, Noxy raised her own, and woke.* She lay in bed and listened to
the windchimes outside her window and the soft, rhythmic snuffle of her mother
snoring in the room below her.  Once her pulse slowed, she fumbled among the
lifetime of odds and ends on top of the two-drawer dresser beside her bed.  Her
hand closed on the little brass lamp her father had given her when she had first
started reading.  She hadn't set it out that morning to recharge it, but the
thumbnail-sized piece of dayglass inside it still gleamed with trapped sunlight
when she opened its cover.

She set it back on the dresser and fished under her pillow to pull out the knit
dolls that lay there.  Her father had made them when she was little, either to
comfort her when she was sick or as a nameday gift or just because he loved her.
She and Sensy and Rash had played with them when they were younger---they had
been pirates and cloudherds and once even pirate cloudherds, which Noxy had
declared ought to be a thing even if it wasn't.

She tucked them back under her pillow.  Her room was still big enough for her to
sit and gossip with Sensy or play a game of stones, but the last time Rash had
joined them, it had somehow seemed much too small, and having Rash over by
himself was---

She sighed.  No matter what her mother said, she needed to talk to Sensy and
find out why she and Rash were made at each other.  *Tomorrow*, she promised
herself, twisting the cover on the dayglass lamp to close it.

She held it in her hand for a second, wondering if the dayglass stopped shining
when there was nowhere for the light to go or whether the light bounced around
being reabsorbed over and over again.  Maybe that's what dreams were---ideas
bouncing around inside her head until they found a way out.  She'd have to tell
Granna Fee... in... the morning...

Moments later, the syncopated rhythm of two people snoring wafted through the
little house.
