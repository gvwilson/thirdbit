<!-- content --><h1>In Heck</h1>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="../">In Heck</a></em> is the second book in a middle-grade trilogy that starts with <em>Maddy Roo</em> (synopsis below).<ul>
<li>Approximately 31,000 words</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The story is a fast-paced adventure with occasional moments of character-driven heartbreak</li>
<li>Like all middles it is proving hard to writeâ€¦</li>
</ul>
<h2>Settings</h2>
<ul>
<li>Long ago, as the world was falling apart, humans created intelligent animals<ul>
<li>Human are now remembered and revered as &ldquo;the Makers&rdquo;, but their nature and appearance has been forgotten</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Different species of intelligent animals can interbreed, but tend to pair with the same species<ul>
<li>Almost all children take after a parent (no half-goat / half-lion hybrids)</li>
<li>But a handful are &ldquo;throwbacks&rdquo; (a slightly derogatory term) or &ldquo;originals&rdquo; (more polite)</li>
<li>Descriptions in the story make it clear to readers that these look human (though their contemporaries don&rsquo;t know that)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some people called &ldquo;specials&rdquo; have the ability to control a few pieces of leftover tech<ul>
<li>Throwback specials can control <em>all</em> tech devices, which  makes them powerful and dangerous</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The last humans put themselves in frozen sleep in an orbiting ark to wait for the world to heal itself<ul>
<li>Ever since, the bots they left behind have been patching and repairing themselves however they can</li>
<li>They are not able to create new bots because they have no way to manufacture new &ldquo;brains&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most bots are part of a hive-mind Consensus<ul>
<li>The only ones with unique personalities are those cut off from Consensus (accidentally or deliberately)</li>
<li>These &ldquo;free bots&rdquo; (polite term) or &ldquo;rogues&rdquo; (less polite) fear being pulled back into Consensus and losing their individuality</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bots and people mingle uneasily<ul>
<li>When they do, bots usually have second-class social status</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Operators are peacekeepers (or vigilantes, depending on your point of view)<ul>
<li>They keep people safe from outlaws and rogue bots</li>
<li>But their secret purpose is to keep watch on throwback specials, who might be able to awaken the sleeping Makers</li>
<li>Neither Consensus nor the few people who know the truth about the Makers want the Makers to return</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Notable places<ul>
<li>Rusty Bridge: a town of about a thousand people</li>
<li>Bots&rsquo; End: a small bot encampment taking shape near Rusty Bridge</li>
<li>Heck: a bot &ldquo;city&rdquo;<ul>
<li>The story reveals that it was the base from which the Makers&rsquo; ark was launched</li>
<li>Consensus bots are still running experiments there in automated laboratories because their programming tells them to</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Mire: a large, polluted swamp between Rusty Bridge and Heck<ul>
<li>Old bunkers and watch towers can be found in it and nearby</li>
<li>An old highway referred to as the Makers&rsquo; Road runs along its edge</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sandy Bend: a larger town two days away<ul>
<li>It is mentioned several times but none of the action occurs there</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Previous Events</h2>
<p>The story takes place in a world of anthropomorphic animals and patchwork robots.
Its protagonist, Maddy,
is a 13-year-old kangaroo whose younger sister Sindy is a &ldquo;throwback&rdquo; with no fur, scales, or tail.
(The description of Sindy make it clear to readers that she looks human,
but the characters in the book don&rsquo;t know what that means:
for them, humans are a half-forgotten legend.)
Maddy and Sindy&rsquo;s father was kidnapped by a raiding band of bots two years before the story starts.
They and their mother have struggled to make ends meet since then.</p>
<p>The story begins with Maddy and a goat boy named Gumption having a run-in with the town bullies.
As Maddy and Gumption walk home afterward they see some broken bits of tech floating downriver.
While fishing it out,
they encounter a damaged bot named Dockety.
The bot&rsquo;s regulator is broken,
which allows it to reveal that rogue bots are about to raid Rusty Bridge again.</p>
<p>Maddy and Gumption rush back to town to warn everyone.
The raiders are driven off,
but manage to grab Sindy and the two bullies.
Maddy teams up with the rescued bot to get her sister back.
They catch up with the raiders and free the prisoners,
but Maddy, Sindy, and Dockety are left stranded in a dangerous swamp called the Mire.
They take refuge in an abandoned bunker,
only to discover that it is the lair of a mad bot named Patient in Darkness,
who is masterminding the raiding parties as part of its campaign
to prove its worth to the Makers.</p>
<p>Maddy, Sindy, and Dockety escape by bolting a flying suit onto Dockety.
They get back to town just moments ahead of another band of raiders.
After the townspeople drive off the raiders,
Maddy realizes that she knows how to break Patient&rsquo;s hold on them.
She uses the flying suit to return to the bunker and frees Patient&rsquo;s minions,
but Patient escapes.
As the story ends,
Dockety reveals that Maddy&rsquo;s father may be alive as a prisoner in the bot city of Heck.</p>

<li>The touch on Maddy&rsquo;s ankle is the little cleaning bot Mouse from the first book<ul>
<li>She thanks it for helping her escape and asks it not to tell Patient she&rsquo;s there</li>
<li>It wavers until she pries off its regulator despite its resistance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Leads her out of the observation tower to a recharging station by the Makers&rsquo; Road<ul>
<li>She hides</li>
<li>Bee Six Vee shows up hauling the wagon with Blazes, Thoughtful, and Sindy (who is starting to worry about the detour)</li>
<li>Maddy and Mouse sneak on board (echoes of her stowing away earlier)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trip to Heck only takes a few hours<ul>
<li>Ground dries out and vegetation disappears as they get closer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They arrive at a gate with derelict buildings beside it (mentioned again below)<ul>
<li>This is as far as Bee Six Vee can safely go</li>
<li>Blazes and Thoughtful get out with Sindy</li>
<li>Sindy panics and activates Blazes&rsquo; tech</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>12 (Gumption)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Goals:<ul>
<li>Connect Gumption and Dockety with Patient</li>
<li>Get them to Heck</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dockety carries Gumption to a gate on the outskirts of Heck</li>
<li>Patient is waiting for them in a building next to the gate (same one that Maddy notices above)<ul>
<li>It monitored their approach and hid them from Consensus (&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have made it this far without me!&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Explains that Consensus and the Operators have been work together to prevent the Makers&rsquo; return</li>
<li>It wants Sindy to awaken the Makers</li>
<li>Proposes that they work together</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gumption refuses<ul>
<li>Believes he and Dockety can do it on their own</li>
<li>But Dockety can already hear Consensus whispering in its head and is afraid</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As they argue, the wagon rolls up to the gate<ul>
<li>Blazes and Thoughtful get out with Sindy</li>
<li>Sindy panics and activates Blazes&rsquo; tech</li>
<li>Thoughtful knocks her out with a dart gun</li>
<li>Bee Six Vee turns around and drives away</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dockety: &ldquo;No choice but try to rescue her&rdquo;<ul>
<li>Patient goes ahead</li>
<li>Dockety opens its chest and hands a remote control to Gumption</li>
<li>&ldquo;This one would rather be deactivated than be part of Consensus again&rdquo;</li>
<li>They go into Heck</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>13 (Maddy)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Goals:<ul>
<li>Maddy finds her father</li>
<li>Mouse betrays Maddy to Consensus</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bee Six Vee stops a few minutes away from Heck<ul>
<li>Mouse distracts it while Maddy gets out of the wagon and into the bushes</li>
<li>Makes her way back to Heck</li>
<li>Mouse catches up to her</li>
<li>Hesitates at the entrance to Heck, but she begs it to come with her, so it does (foreshadowing)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maddy and Mouse sneak through Heck<ul>
<li>Easier than expected: large parts are not just derelict, but empty</li>
<li>The few bots she does see are engaged in pointless, repetitive tasks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make their way to a building that appears to be properly maintained (follow fresh bot tracks)<ul>
<li>A dormitory with people also doing pointless, repetitive tasks</li>
<li>A moose doing math problems</li>
<li>An orangutan patiently assembling a jigsaw puzzle</li>
<li>All of whom ignore her except a boar with one tusk who is in charge of intake</li>
<li>Dully tells them a station will be prepared</li>
<li>Mouse&rsquo;s behavior becoming erratic</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Find Papa Roo sitting at a desk sketching<ul>
<li>She pleads with him to wake up</li>
<li>For a moment nothing happens, then Papa Roo blinks and stands up shakily</li>
<li>He looks smaller than Maddy remembers</li>
<li>Fur has worn off the underside of his right arm where it rested on the table</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He thinks he&rsquo;s seeing things<ul>
<li>Takes a moment to believe his daughters are really there</li>
<li>Then he&rsquo;s grief-stricken: &ldquo;It knows you&rsquo;re here! You have to get out!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Maddy: &ldquo;Not without you!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That&rsquo;s when Mouse zaps Maddy unconscious</li>
</ul>
<h3>14 (Gumption)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Goals:<ul>
<li>Dockety&rsquo;s struggle with Consensus</li>
<li>Dockety and Gumption confront the Operators</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Patient, Dockety, and Gumption make their way through Heck<ul>
<li>Dockety is shaken to discover that it is mostly empty</li>
<li>Turns out it doesn&rsquo;t know how long since it was last there</li>
<li>Patient: &ldquo;Consensus doesn&rsquo;t want to continue but cannot stop&rdquo;</li>
<li>Dockety&rsquo;s speech is occasionally erratic because of its struggle to resist Consensus</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Patient leads them to the dormitory<ul>
<li>Obviously knows the way</li>
<li>Dismisses the inmates with a wave: &ldquo;Merely for baseline comparison - they are not important&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Patient is surprised and angered to discover that Papa Roo is missing<ul>
<li>The boar tells them that he and the &ldquo;new one&rdquo; have been taken for further processing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Patient assumes that &ldquo;the new one&rdquo; is Sindy<ul>
<li>Rages that its plan is falling apart</li>
<li>Urges them on to the central lab</li>
<li>Dockety struggles against Consensus and freezes</li>
<li>Gumption tries to wake it</li>
<li>Patient: &ldquo;Nothing you can do: it will win or lose&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Patient and Gumption race over to the central lab (has a large antenna on roof)<ul>
<li>Arrive just in time to see the Operators enter with Sindy</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>15 (Maddy)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Goals:<ul>
<li>Get all the main characters in one place</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maddy regains consciousness in a chair<ul>
<li>Not strapped in but can&rsquo;t move anything below her neck</li>
<li>Her father is in the chair beside her but unresponsive</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A humanoid bot appears<ul>
<li>When Maddy asks if it is Consensus it says &ldquo;yes&rdquo;</li>
<li>Then picks up Mouse, which flashes, &ldquo;As is this one&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Off-kilter dialog with Consensus<ul>
<li>Reinforces Patient&rsquo;s claim that Consensus wants to stop but its programming won&rsquo;t allow it to</li>
<li>Doesn&rsquo;t want the Makers to return because they would make it continue</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Blazes and Thoughtful enter with Sindy<ul>
<li>Thoughtful is apologetic, Blazes is sure of himself: handing over Sindy is necessary</li>
<li>Maddy: &ldquo;Just going to kill her?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Consensus: &ldquo;These do not kill. These will try to get her to turn these off.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Takes Sindy from the Operators and puts her in an empty chair next to Maddy<ul>
<li>Put on a headset that connects to a complicated piece of machinery</li>
<li>Consensus: &ldquo;Central communications hub - without it, we become our component parts&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gumption breaks in</li>
</ul>
<h3>16 (Gumption)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Goals:<ul>
<li>Battle with the Operators</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Repeat the conversation of the previous chapter from Gumption (watching from outside)<ul>
<li>Gumption: &ldquo;What can we do?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Patient (with relish): &ldquo;We can triumph!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Takes a random piece off itself and hands it to Gumption: &ldquo;Use this&rdquo;</li>
<li>Gumption: &ldquo;What does it do?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Patient: &ldquo;Nothing, but they do not know that&rdquo;</li>
<li>Then it freezes (becomes unresponsive)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gumption breaks in<ul>
<li>Tries to sound cocky as he reassures Maddy that everything&rsquo;s going to work out</li>
<li>Shows the courage/resolve that he&rsquo;s always wanted</li>
<li>Notices that Sindy has regained consciousness</li>
<li>Gumption continues bluffing, dropping heavy hints that Sindy should do something</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Thoughtful shoots the gear out of Gumption&rsquo;s hands<ul>
<li>Blazes: &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t have you telling tales&rdquo;</li>
<li>Starts to fire up his tech to immolate Gumption</li>
<li>The bots in the room simultaneously speak in Patient&rsquo;s voice: &ldquo;Finally&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>17 (Maddy)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Goals:<ul>
<li>Action!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The bots attack the Operators</li>
<li>Gumption gets Maddy free<ul>
<li>She makes a comment about his &ldquo;bathing suit&rdquo;</li>
<li>Uses her discombobulator to &ldquo;hide&rdquo; herself long enough to reach Sindy</li>
<li>Sindy tells Maddy to leave her in her chair: she needs to help Consensus</li>
<li>Patient: &ldquo;Consensus is no more. There is only <em>me</em>.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Sindy: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Three-way fight (action takes up most of the chapter)<ul>
<li>Gumption is trying to stop Blazes and Thoughtful from shooting Sindy</li>
<li>Bots are trying to stop the Operators</li>
<li>Patient and Consensus are fighting for control of the bots (which speak in both their voices alternately)</li>
<li>Maddy is yelling but cannot get out of her chair</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All looks hopeless until Dockety arrives</li>
</ul>
<h3>18 (Gumption)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Goals:<ul>
<li>Patient&rsquo;s &ldquo;death&rdquo;</li>
<li>Operators are defeated</li>
<li>Dockety discovers it is strong enough to resist Consensus</li>
<li>Protagonists escape from Heck with Papa Roo and Sindy</li>
<li>Gumption and Maddy finally get together</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dockety throws itself in front of Sindy to save her from Blazes&rsquo; blast<ul>
<li>Echo of Leaf&rsquo;s earlier sacrifice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enraged, Sindy turns on all of the machines in the lab<ul>
<li>They speak with <em>her</em> voice as they seize Blazes and Thoughtful</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We hear Sindy start to lose control<ul>
<li>And then Patient&rsquo;s voice comes through again: &ldquo;It worked!&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;All&rdquo; included the control for the antenna on top of the building</li>
<li>Consensus starts to dissolve (gratefully)</li>
<li>And then Patient realizes that it is dissolving as well (will not &ldquo;live&rdquo; to enjoy its victory)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sindy passes out</li>
<li>Mouse jump-starts Dockety</li>
<li>Maddy regains control of her body</li>
<li>Gumption and Maddy kiss</li>
</ul>
<h3>19: Epilog (both PoV)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Goals:<ul>
<li>Happy ending</li>
<li>Set up final book</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On the Roos&rsquo; porch<ul>
<li>Brief recap of their trip home from Heck</li>
<li>Papa Roo is still fuzzy but getting better</li>
<li>Dockety and Crusher are adopting/upgrading Mouse</li>
<li>Gumption and Maddy are sitting together, holding hands</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sindy says she feels a bit sorry for Patient</li>
<li>Mama Roo is scathing about the Operators (&ldquo;good riddance&rdquo;)<ul>
<li>Suspicious that Bee Six Vee is now living in Bots&rsquo; End</li>
<li>Dockety: &ldquo;Everyone deserves a chance&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And then a star begins to descend from the sky<ul>
<li>Papa Roo: &ldquo;The Makers are returning&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
