<!-- content --><h1>In Heck</h1>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="../">In Heck</a></em> is the second book in a middle-grade trilogy that starts with <em>Maddy Roo</em> (synopsis below).<ul>
<li>Approximately 31,000 words</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The story is a fast-paced adventure with occasional moments of character-driven heartbreak</li>
<li>Like all middles it is proving hard to writeâ€¦</li>
</ul>
<h2>Settings</h2>
<ul>
<li>Long ago, as the world was falling apart, humans created intelligent animals<ul>
<li>Human are now remembered and revered as &ldquo;the Makers&rdquo;, but their nature and appearance has been forgotten</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Different species of intelligent animals can interbreed, but tend to pair with the same species<ul>
<li>Almost all children take after a parent (no half-goat / half-lion hybrids)</li>
<li>But a handful are &ldquo;throwbacks&rdquo; (a slightly derogatory term) or &ldquo;originals&rdquo; (more polite)</li>
<li>Descriptions in the story make it clear to readers that these look human (though their contemporaries don&rsquo;t know that)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some people called &ldquo;specials&rdquo; have the ability to control a few pieces of leftover tech<ul>
<li>Throwback specials can control <em>all</em> tech devices, which  makes them powerful and dangerous</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The last humans put themselves in frozen sleep in an orbiting ark to wait for the world to heal itself<ul>
<li>Ever since, the bots they left behind have been patching and repairing themselves however they can</li>
<li>They are not able to create new bots because they have no way to manufacture new &ldquo;brains&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most bots are part of a hive-mind Consensus<ul>
<li>The only ones with unique personalities are those cut off from Consensus (accidentally or deliberately)</li>
<li>These &ldquo;free bots&rdquo; (polite term) or &ldquo;rogues&rdquo; (less polite) fear being pulled back into Consensus and losing their individuality</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bots and people mingle uneasily<ul>
<li>When they do, bots usually have second-class social status</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Operators are peacekeepers (or vigilantes, depending on your point of view)<ul>
<li>They keep people safe from outlaws and rogue bots</li>
<li>But their secret purpose is to keep watch on throwback specials, who might be able to awaken the sleeping Makers</li>
<li>Neither Consensus nor the few people who know the truth about the Makers want the Makers to return</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Notable places<ul>
<li>Rusty Bridge: a town of about a thousand people</li>
<li>Bots&rsquo; End: a small bot encampment taking shape near Rusty Bridge</li>
<li>Heck: a bot &ldquo;city&rdquo;<ul>
<li>The story reveals that it was the base from which the Makers&rsquo; ark was launched</li>
<li>Consensus bots are still running experiments there in automated laboratories because their programming tells them to</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Mire: a large, polluted swamp between Rusty Bridge and Heck<ul>
<li>Old bunkers and watch towers can be found in it and nearby</li>
<li>An old highway referred to as the Makers&rsquo; Road runs along its edge</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sandy Bend: a larger town two days away<ul>
<li>It is mentioned several times but none of the action occurs there</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Previous Events</h2>
<p>The story takes place in a world of anthropomorphic animals and patchwork robots.
Its protagonist, Maddy,
is a 13-year-old kangaroo whose younger sister Sindy is a &ldquo;throwback&rdquo; with no fur, scales, or tail.
(The description of Sindy make it clear to readers that she looks human,
but the characters in the book don&rsquo;t know what that means:
for them, humans are a half-forgotten legend.)
Maddy and Sindy&rsquo;s father was kidnapped by a raiding band of bots two years before the story starts.
They and their mother have struggled to make ends meet since then.</p>
<p>The story begins with Maddy and a goat boy named Gumption having a run-in with the town bullies.
As Maddy and Gumption walk home afterward they see some broken bits of tech floating downriver.
While fishing it out,
they encounter a damaged bot named Dockety.
The bot&rsquo;s regulator is broken,
which allows it to reveal that rogue bots are about to raid Rusty Bridge again.</p>
<p>Maddy and Gumption rush back to town to warn everyone.
The raiders are driven off,
but manage to grab Sindy and the two bullies.
Maddy teams up with the rescued bot to get her sister back.
They catch up with the raiders and free the prisoners,
but Maddy, Sindy, and Dockety are left stranded in a dangerous swamp called the Mire.
They take refuge in an abandoned bunker,
only to discover that it is the lair of a mad bot named Patient in Darkness,
who is masterminding the raiding parties as part of its campaign
to prove its worth to the Makers.</p>
<p>Maddy, Sindy, and Dockety escape by bolting a flying suit onto Dockety.
They get back to town just moments ahead of another band of raiders.
After the townspeople drive off the raiders,
Maddy realizes that she knows how to break Patient&rsquo;s hold on them.
She uses the flying suit to return to the bunker and frees Patient&rsquo;s minions,
but Patient escapes.
As the story ends,
Dockety reveals that Maddy&rsquo;s father may be alive as a prisoner in the bot city of Heck.</p>
