<h1>In Heck</h1>



<section>
<h2>Mail (Maddy)</h2>
<p>Maddy was sketching the willow tree in the main square of Rusty Bridge
when one of the Ox brothers hollered,
&ldquo;Mail&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo;
<em>Finally</em>, she thought,
giving her drawing one last despairing look.
The branches were in the right places,
but somehow the lines on the page didn&rsquo;t capture
the drooping greenery in front of her.</p>
<p>She sighed and tucked her sketchbook into
the blue canvas satchel her father had made for her tenth birthday.
A lot had happened since then,
but at least now she knew he might still be alive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waitin&rsquo; on anythin&rsquo; in particular?&rdquo;
a familiar voice drawled behind her.</p>
<p>Maddy jumped, startled.
Mayor Lupus smiled down at her,
a mug of tea in her hand.
It was a kindly smile,
but it still showed a lot of teeth.
&ldquo;Mama sent off for some seeds,&rdquo; Maddy said.
&ldquo;And my chores were all done, and—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;—and it&rsquo;s a beautiful day so why not sit for a bit?&rdquo;
the old wolf finished, nodding agreeably.
She jerked her chin toward Maddy&rsquo;s bag.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; a lot better.
Your pa would be pleased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Maddy mumbled.
Mayor Lupus had a way of looking at someone
that made them feel like she could read their mind.
That was part of why the village kept electing her:
most people felt guilty just thinking about running against her.</p>
<p>A double handful of people gathered to gossip as they waited for the mail.
Zeke Bear had finally fixed the smokehouse
that had been knocked down during the attack a few months ago.
He might not especially like the bots who had helped save them,
but he would allow that they were useful.
The apple orchard was draining properly for the first time in forever,
and there wasn&rsquo;t a dull pair of scissors in town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, owing a bot favors makes me uncomfortable,&rdquo;
Miz Tumbly sighed loudly,
shaking her graying mane.</p>
<p>Mayor Lupus tipped the dregs of her tea into a planter.
&ldquo;I reckon lettin&rsquo; &lsquo;em settle in beside us is payment enough,&rdquo;
she said conversationally.
&ldquo;And if any trouble shows up, well…&rdquo;
She rapped her gnarlywood cane against her mechanical leg.
&ldquo;Fightin&rsquo; bots is a lot easier when you have a few on your side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miz Tumbly&rsquo;s whiskers twitched slightly at the rebuke.
She had put herself forward for election the year before,
but had garnered even fewer votes than the mayor&rsquo;s previous challenger.
&ldquo;A lot of folks think it&rsquo;s time for a change,&rdquo;
Mama Roo had explained to Maddy afterward,
&ldquo;But if she&rsquo;s the change, they&rsquo;d rather wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aaaaand right on time,&rdquo;
Mayor Lupus said as the mailbot came into view.
Eighty-Eight Able-Six (&ldquo;but call me Able&rdquo;) looked like three metal boxes
perched on top of one another
with a single small wheel up front
and two spoked cartwheels in the rear.
It only had one arm,
and like many of the refugee bots it had patches and welds from years of mending,
but someone had made it a blue hat with a little tin badge,
and it was the most cheerful bot Maddy had ever met.</p>
<p>Able rolled to a halt and doffed its hat.
&ldquo;Good morning, one and all,&rdquo; it said jauntily,
replacing its hat and then opening a hatch in its side.
&ldquo;Got letters, got parcels, even got a newspaper from Sandy Bend.&rdquo;
Its periscope cameras swivelled from side to side
as it handed out what it had brought.</p>
<p>Someone bumped Maddy&rsquo;s elbow.
&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo;
Gumption said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; she said back.
He had slicked down his fur again the way some of the older goats did.
It made them look tough,
but on Gumption—she stifled a sigh.
It had taken him a long time to heal after the attack.
Once he was back on his feet he had started using the punching bag
in Zeke Bear&rsquo;s barn
and doing militia drills with an old pike.
She had hoped they would spend time together that summer,
just the two of them,
but &ldquo;together&rdquo; seemed to be the last thing on his mind.</p>
<p>Gumption jerked his chin at the mailbot.
&ldquo;Anything for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was about to say, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; when Able called her name.
She traded a glass penny for a letter in a plain brown envelope
with &ldquo;Miz Madalena Roo, Resident in Rusty Bridge&rdquo; written in strong square letters on its front.</p>
<p>Maddy took a slow breath.
&ldquo;Well? Aren&rsquo;t you gonna open it?&rdquo;
Gumption asked.</p>
<p>She shook her head.
&ldquo;Not here.
You want to go look in on Special Leaf?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption shrugged.
&ldquo;Sure.
Has he got Sindy doin&rsquo; magic tricks again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ssh!&rdquo;
Maddy glanced around involuntarily.
Special Leaf insisted that they keep her sister&rsquo;s abilities secret.</p>
<p>Gumption shrugged again.
&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he muttered,
and then,
&ldquo;Hey—look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in tarnation?&rdquo; Mayor Lupus exclaimed.
A murmur ran through the crowd
as two bots entered the square with a pair of muddy, sullen goats between them.
Dockety was in the lead,
its mis-matched arms swinging as it strode toward the crowd.
Its companion Crusher brought up the rear on heavy treads,
and in between—</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are those boys <em>tied up</em>?&rdquo;
Miz Tumbly gasped,
her ears folding down in shock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet down,&rdquo; Mayor Lupus said sharply.
The crowd parted to let her through,
her cane clicking on the cobblestones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; she said to Dockety.
&ldquo;I thought Able had brought all the mail,
but it seems you have somethin&rsquo; for us too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lenses on the front of Dockety&rsquo;s head rotated a quarter turn and back
with a faint <em>zick zick</em>.
&ldquo;These ones were apprehended
while attempting to take possession of items that do not belong to them,&rdquo;
it said,
its voice buzzing slightly.
&ldquo;We request punitive measures to deter further attempts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mayor Lupus sucked in her cheeks.
&ldquo;Is that right, boys?
Were you stealin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
Bluster Goat said vehemently.
&ldquo;We were just tryin&rsquo; to find out if they been hidin&rsquo; stuff,
and we did!
They got weapons stashed away!
All kinds of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said quiet down!&rdquo;
Mayor Lupus snapped as people began muttering.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty serious accusation.
You best be sure of your ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo seen &lsquo;em too,&rdquo; Bluster said.
His twin brother nodded vigorously.
&ldquo;Big pile o&rsquo; stuff laid out in a shed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are not weapons,&rdquo;
Dockety buzzed.
&ldquo;They are spare parts.
Many of us still require repairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spare parts my tail!&rdquo; Bluster said hotly.
&ldquo;They got a zap gun an&rsquo; saw blades and all sorts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dockety?
Any o&rsquo; that true?&rdquo;
the mayor asked.
Her tone was still light,
her ears had flattened too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These possess several saw blades,&rdquo; the bot acknowledged.
It gestured at Crusher.
&ldquo;This one has been using them to clear brush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the zap gun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not operational.&rdquo;
The bot&rsquo;s lenses rotated back and forth again.
&ldquo;But if we are able to repair it,
we will use it only for defensive purposes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Says <em>you</em>,&rdquo;
Miz Tumbly said just loudly enough to be heard.</p>
<p>Mayor Lupus scowled.
&ldquo;Would have been neighborly to let us know you had that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Understood,&rdquo; Dockety said.
&ldquo;These will do so in future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you two,&rdquo;
the mayor continued,
turning to the goat twins.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your place to be pokin&rsquo; around like that.
No,
don&rsquo;t interrupt me,
that&rsquo;s just going to make me cranky.
You&rsquo;re both on ditch duty for the next month,
and if you do somethin&rsquo; lump stupid like this again
you&rsquo;ll be lookin&rsquo; back on ditches like they were apple pie.
You got that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bluster opened his mouth to protest,
but snapped it shut when his twin kicked his leg.
&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m,&rdquo; they said in sullen unison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then.&rdquo;
Mayor Lupus nodded at Dockety to untie them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of here,&rdquo; Blsuter snapped at his brother
once they were free.
They stalked away side by side,
their boots clomping on the cobblestones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those boys make me <em>so</em> mad!&rdquo;
Maddy grouched to Gumption.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;d be chained up in Heck or worse
if it weren&rsquo;t for Dockety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess,&rdquo;
Gumption said noncommittally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think so?&rdquo;
Maddy demanded hotly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo;
Gumption protested.
&ldquo;But Miz Tumbly was by for tea yesterday,
and she and my ma and pa were all sayin&rsquo;
we don&rsquo;t really know much about them.
I like havin&rsquo; &lsquo;em here,&rdquo;
he added hastily,
anticipating Maddy&rsquo;s outrage.
&ldquo;But she said—Miz Tumbly, I mean—that they call us &lsquo;breathers&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we call &lsquo;em a lot worse than that,&rdquo;
Maddy snapped.</p>
<p>Gumption threw up his hands.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t!
I like &lsquo;em better than I like a lot o&rsquo; people,
you know that!
I&rsquo;m just sayin&rsquo; a lot of folks aren&rsquo;t as quick with change as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever Maddy might have said next was cut off
by a pair of voices shouting,
&ldquo;Fight! Fight!&rdquo;</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>The Operators (Gumption)</h2>
<p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo;
Mayor Lupus asked,
exasperated,
as the twins ran back into the square.</p>
<p>Bluster bent over and put his elbows on his knees to catch his breath.
&ldquo;Some travelers just come off the road!&rdquo;
Bravo panted.
&ldquo;An&rsquo; the bots are fightin&rsquo; with &lsquo;em!
They got guns an&rsquo; tech an&rsquo; everythin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever Mayor Lupus might have said next was cut off
by a sizzle and a sharp <em>crack!</em>
A fireball shot into the air
from the other side of the blacksmith&rsquo;s,
leaving a trail of smoke behind it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; Mayor Lupus barked,
jabbing a finger at Maddy.
&ldquo;Fast as you can,
go an&rsquo; get Special Leaf!
The rest of you, stay here!&rdquo;
She shouldered past the gaping onlookers and trotted back the way the twins had come
as another fireball followed the first into the sky.
People hesitated,
exchanged looks,
and followed after her.</p>
<p>Gumption looked around
just as Maddy rounded the corner on her way to Special Leaf&rsquo;s.
He took one step to follow her,
swore,
and chased after the crowd instead.</p>
<p>He caught up with them in time to hear Mayor Lupus shout, &ldquo;Enough!&rdquo;
Dockety and Crusher stood side by side on the street facing four strangers,
each looking more dangerous than the one before.
The rabbit had a long rifle on her shoulder
and a slouch hat pulled down over her ears.
The armor on the six-legged mulebot beside her put Special Leaf&rsquo;s shell to shame.
Behind them was a tiger with a black patch over one eye,
his hands raised as if to throw rocks.
A bear carrying almost as much gear as the mulebot brought up the rear.
She wore the same dark green jacket with black collar and cuffs
as the rabbit and tiger,
while the mulebot was painted in matching camouflage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Operators,&rdquo; Gumption breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No kidding.&rdquo;
Bluster elbowed him hard,
but his eyes were just as wide as Gumption&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone mind explainin&rsquo; what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on here?&rdquo;
Mayor Lupus said,
her tone making it clear that &ldquo;no thank you&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t an acceptable answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My apologies, Mayor Lupus,&rdquo;
the tiger replied,
lisping slightly around his fangs.
&ldquo;These two friends of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re neighbors.&rdquo;
She flicked an ear.
&ldquo;But you do have me at a disadvantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Special Blazes at your service,&rdquo;
the tiger replied,
tapping a finger against the brim of his hat.</p>
<p>The crowd let out its collective breath.
&ldquo;I <em>knew</em> it,&rdquo; Gumption said under his breath,
ignoring another withering look from Maddy.</p>
<p>Special Blazes was <em>famous</em>.
Every story in the newspaper about his exploits said so:
&ldquo;The famous Special Blazes has triumphed again!&rdquo;
The Case of the Snorkeling Smugglers,
the Shootout at Half-Heart Pass,
his year-long pursuit of the villainous Mattock sisters—Gumption had devoured them all
despite Maddy&rsquo;s disdain for &ldquo;sensationalism&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,
Special,
it&rsquo;s an honor to have you here,&rdquo;
Mayor Lupus said.
&ldquo;Oh,
and may I introduce Special Leaf?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elderly tortoise had arrived without Gumption noticing,
Maddy two steps behind him.
He was wearing a shapeless gray sweater
that Mama Bear had knit for him the winter before last,
and had an old blue scarf wrapped around his neck as well.
He peered at the Operators through his little round glasses
as if trying to decide whether they were books that needed re-shelving.</p>
<p>The rabbit doffed her hat as Special Blazes dipped his head deferentially.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an honor&rdquo; the tiger rumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo;
Special Leaf said in a slightly fuddled tone.
&ldquo;As the mayor says,
Crusher and Dockety are neighbors.
I&rsquo;m sure they didn&rsquo;t mean to scare you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bear behind Special Blazes muttered something
that may or may not have been,
&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t scared.&rdquo;
The tiger inclined his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to hear it.
My apologies if we overreacted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mayor Lupus turned her head.
&ldquo;Dockety?&rdquo; she said as the moment stretched.
&ldquo;Anything you&rsquo;d like to stay to the Special?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bot&rsquo;s lenses rotated.
&ldquo;Welcome to Rusty Bridge.&rdquo;
It warbled at Crusher,
who lowered its massive arms reluctantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,
I&rsquo;m glad that&rsquo;s sorted,&rdquo;
Special Leaf said brightly.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d like some tea,
you&rsquo;d be very, um…&rdquo;
He gestured vaguely in the direction of his house.</p>
<p>Special Blazes dipped his head again.
&ldquo;Thank you,
but what we&rsquo;d like most right now is a chance to wash up
and chat with the mayor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mulebot made a grinding noise.
The corner of Special Blazes&rsquo; mouth quirked.
&ldquo;Or in Bee Six Vee&rsquo;s case,
a bit of oil,&rdquo;
he amended.
&ldquo;And miz mayor,
if you can spare a bit of time for conversation,
I&rsquo;d be grateful for that as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mayor Lupus waved the three flesh-and-blood Operators toward the square.
The townspeople dithered and buzzed for a few moments,
then decided in ones and twos that their chores weren&rsquo;t going to do themselves
and headed for home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ever seen Operators before?&rdquo;
Gumption asked Special Leaf.</p>
<p>The old tortoise nodded.
&ldquo;Not in some years,&rdquo; he said quietly,
all traces of fuddlement gone from his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think they&rsquo;re here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Special Leaf shook his head.
&ldquo;I wish I knew.
But please,
be very, very careful what you say,
especially around Blazes.
He is every bit as smart as the stories say,
and the less he knows about Sindy,
the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The threesome walked back to Special Leaf&rsquo;s house in silence.
&ldquo;Done for the day?&rdquo;
Maddy asked her sister once they were inside,
ruffling the hair on top of Sindy&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just let me finish this chapter,&rdquo;
Sindy said without looking up from her book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome to take it with you,&rdquo;
Special Leaf said gently.
The battle with the bots had added more wrinkles to Special Leaf&rsquo;s green-gray hide,
but his eyes were still bright behind his little round glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is the most exciting part!
Please?&rdquo;
Sindy pleaded.</p>
<p>Maddy looked at Gumption, who shrugged.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;
He was supposed to spend the day weeding his family&rsquo;s vegetable garden.
It wasn&rsquo;t the worst job in the world,
but even if he wore his father&rsquo;s waxed cotton slicker
his fur would get soaked and muddy,
and stooping over would make his mended ribs ache.
On the other hand,
at least Maddy had asked before making a decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five minutes,&rdquo;
Maddy told her sister sternly.</p>
<p>Special Leaf nodded toward the kitchen.
The two teenagers followed him into it.
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s she doing?&rdquo; Maddy asked
as Gumption plopped himself down in his usual chair,
then winced at a twinge in his ribs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo;
the old tortoise said.
He fished a small metal-rimmed rectangle of black glass out of his pocket.
&ldquo;I came by this up years ago.
Never knew what it did,
but she picked it up this morning
and all of a sudden it was full of pictures.
And not just any pictures,&rdquo;
he confided.
&ldquo;They were from the book she was reading.
It was like it read her mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great,&rdquo; Gumption said when Maddy didn&rsquo;t respond.
Her sister was one of those rare people with no tail,
no whiskers or scales,
and no fur except for the wiry black tuft on her head.
When other children wanted to be cruel they called her a throwback,
but every piece of tech she touched responded to her.</p>
<p>Every time Maddy thought about what that might mean it scared her,
Gumption elbowed her in the ribs to take her mind off it.
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to tell him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Special Leaf wrinkled his forehead,
which was as close as he could get to raising his nonexistent eyebrows.
Maddy reluctantly pulled the letter out of her satchel.
&ldquo;I was wondering when that would arrive,&rdquo; Special Leaf said.
He opened the breadbox on the counter behind him,
took out a butternut cookie,
and offered it to Maddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this for?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s good news, for celebrating,&rdquo; Special Leaf said.
&ldquo;And if it&rsquo;s not,
well,
at least you&rsquo;ll have a cookie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption elbowed her again.
&ldquo;Just <em>open</em> it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddy swallowed,
tore the envelope open,
and unfolded the beige rectangle of paper inside.
Her face fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, muck,&rdquo; Gumption said,
patting her awkwardly on the shoulder.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.
&ldquo;No.
No.
They—&rdquo;
She laughed shakily.
&ldquo;They said yes.
They&rsquo;re going to publish it.
They&rsquo;re going to put my drawing in the newspaper!
Woo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hugged Gumption impulsively,
then turned to Special Leaf with a grin as wide as a sunrise on her face.
&ldquo;Congratulations,&rdquo; he said as she took an enormous bite out of the cookie.</p>
<p>Later that night,
Gumption lay in his narrow cot
and listened to the evening&rsquo;s raindrops drip off on the cottonwood outside his attic bedroom.
The sound matched his mood perfectly.
He was happy for Maddy,
he really was.
Having one of her drawing published in a newspaper
mattered almost as much to her
as saving Rusty Bridge from a band of marauding bots.</p>
<p>It was great news,
but it also meant she was that much closer
to leaving for somewhere better with people as smart and as talented as she was.
He&rsquo;d known since their first conversation about books at Special Leaf&rsquo;s house
that she would go some day.
He just wished that day wasn&rsquo;t getting closer quite so fast.</p>
<p>He nearly fell out of bed when something rapped softly on his window.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Bout time,&rdquo; he muttered,
getting quietly to his feet.
He had oiled the shutter after dinner to prevent it squeaking,
and the nearest branch of the cottonwood was an easy stretch away.</p>
<p>Dockety waited patiently for him at the base of the tree.
&ldquo;Thank you again for warning this one about your cousins&rsquo; plan,&rdquo;
it said without preamble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome.&rdquo;
Gumption hesitated.
&ldquo;So what did you find out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bot&rsquo;s lenses rotated back and forth.
&ldquo;He is still alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption swallowed hard.
It was what he&rsquo;d hoped to hear, but—
&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,
but he is the right age, gender, and body shape,
and Central&rsquo;s record of him starts at the right time.&rdquo;
A single drip from its leaves trickled down the bot&rsquo;s head as it spoke.
&ldquo;It will be difficult to obtain more information.
We can only communicate when—&rdquo;
Dockety paused.
&ldquo;You do not have the words.
There are little moons above this world,
placed in the sky by the Makers.
We can only inspect Central&rsquo;s records when they are in the right positions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption shook his head.
He didn&rsquo;t understand the part about &ldquo;little moons&rdquo;,
but that didn&rsquo;t matter.
&ldquo;Is he aright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is—&rdquo;
Dockety paused again as if searching for the right word.
&ldquo;He is functional, but not optimal.
Heck was not designed to sustain organics.
There are machines in the facility that only work for organic operators.
This is why Central takes your people,
but they usually do not last this long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sudden thought struck him.
&ldquo;What about the Operators?&rdquo; he asked excitedly.
&ldquo;They must know <em>tons</em> about sneaking into places like this!
I can bring &lsquo;em out here to meet you and—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;
Dockety&rsquo;s voice buzzed sharply.
&ldquo;Not them.
They hunt our kind.
They disconnect us.
They <em>disassemble</em> us.
You must not trust them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,
that&rsquo;s basically what Special Leaf said.&rdquo;
Gumption sighed.
&ldquo;Aright.
Thank you for findin&rsquo; out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he reached for a branch of the cottonwood Dockety asked,
&ldquo;What are you going to tell Miz Roo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno yet.&rdquo;
Gumption grunted
at the sharp pain in his side as he pulled himself up into the tree.</p>

<h2>School (Maddy)</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Miz Tumbly,&rdquo;
Maddy said the next morning.
She and Sindy had gotten to school
just as Rusty Bridge&rsquo;s other children were finishing
a ragged rendition of the Plea to the Makers.
Miz Tumbly scolded them more sternly than usual
as they slipped into their usual seats.</p>
<p>The reason quickly became apparent.
&ldquo;Class,
we have a special treat today.
How many of you know what a Operator is?&rdquo;
Every hand shot into the air.
&ldquo;And how many of you know that
we actually have some Operators here in Rusty Bridge <em>right now</em>?&rdquo;
Hands strained to reach even higher
as an excited murmur rippled through the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
Miz Tumbly said indulgently,
&ldquo;If you all promise to be <em>very good</em>,
we have a special treat today.
Everybody find a partner.
No,
Jessamyn,
you can&rsquo;t be your own partner,
just—yes, anyone will do.
All right?
Two by two,
then,
let&rsquo;s go outside for our surprise!&rdquo;
She sighed as twenty-two children scrambled for the door,
their partners forgotten.</p>
<p>Gumption was the last one through the door.
&ldquo;Oh wow,&rdquo; he breathed,
then added,
&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo;
when Maddy shot him a look.
There,
in the center of the more-or-less rectangular field behind the school,
stood Special Blazes and the bear who had arrived with him.
Both wore their uniform trousers,
but instead of their jackets they were in plain tunics
no different from a farm hand&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get outta-come on, I wanna see.&rdquo;
Bluster and Bravo shouldered their way through the other children
to stand front and center.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I missed you in class today,&rdquo;
Miz Tumbly said curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doin&rsquo; chores,&rdquo;
Bluster lied without looking at her.
He elbowed his twin.
&ldquo;Look at the size of &lsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tiger&rsquo;s ear twitched.
Without warning he crouched and roared.
Everyone jumped,
and a few of the smaller children squeaked.</p>
<p>Special Blazes straightened and bared his teeth in a smile.
&ldquo;Good morning.
Who can tell me what we just learned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you&rsquo;re really scary!&rdquo;
Bluster called,
scowling when Bravo made a kissing sound beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I try,&rdquo;
Special Blazes said modestly.
&ldquo;But the real lesson is surprise.
If you&rsquo;re ever in trouble—if you&rsquo;re ever attacked
by bots or anyone else—try to surprise them.
Do something unexpected.
Like this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He scooped up a wooden baton from the grass by his feet
and swung it at his companion&rsquo;s head.
Maddy heard it cut the air,
but the bear was faster.
She twisted sideways to avoid the first blow,
ducked to avoid the second,
then threw a punch that would have knocked the tiger halfway across the field
if it had landed.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t.
Instead,
the tiger spun the baton around to knock the blow aside,
then stepped in close and brought his hand up to the bear&rsquo;s throat.
&ldquo;Aaaand you&rsquo;re dead,&rdquo; he said pleasantly.</p>
<p>Some of the children clapped.
&ldquo;Oh come now,&rdquo;
Special Blazes said,
&ldquo;You can do better than that for my friend Meribeth,
can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption joined the applause,
but stopped at a sour look from Maddy.
&ldquo;So here&rsquo;s the second lesson,&rdquo;
the tiger said.
&ldquo;Training wins.
Training beats size and speed and everything else you can think of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about tech?&rdquo;
Bluster asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even tech,&rdquo;
Meribeth rasped.
Her voice was as rough as sandpaper on rust.
She took the baton from Special Blazes,
spun it around,
and settled into fighting stance.</p>
<p>The tiger stepped back,
raised his fists,
and winked at the children as his fists burst into flame.
The flurry of punches, kicks, and whirlwind baton strikes that followed
was too fast for Gumption to follow.
Special Blazes threw one fireball after another.
The bear batted them aside,
somehow finding time to strike at her opponent in between.</p>
<p>And then Meribeth threw the baton at Special Blazes&rsquo; head.
As he ducked,
she reached forward and grabbed the front of his shirt.
&ldquo;Gotcha,&rdquo; she growled.</p>
<p>Nobody had to prompt the children to applaud this time.
&ldquo;Woo hoo!&rdquo; Bluster whooped.
&ldquo;That was <em>amazing</em>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miz Tumbly stepped forward.
&ldquo;All right, um, thank you,
thank you very much for, um, for that demonstration&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Now how about we all line up and go <em>back into the classroom</em>
and we can ask the Operators about
all the <em>other</em> things they know how to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption and Maddy found themselves in line behind the goat twins.
&ldquo;We <em>got</em> to be Operators,&rdquo; Bluster told his twin excitedly.
&ldquo;Did you see how they—blam! blam!&rdquo;
He threw a couple of punches at the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was all right,&rdquo;
Bravo allowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bet they rehearsed the whole thing,&rdquo;
Maddy muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better than drawin&rsquo; stupid little pictures,&rdquo;
Bluster shot back.
Gumption put his hand on Maddy&rsquo;s arm and squeezed to stop her from replying.</p>
<p>The children settled into their seats.
Special Blazes stood at the front of the class
with his hands clasped behind his back.
&ldquo;Now, who has questions?&rdquo; Miz Tumbly asked.</p>
<p>Hands shot into the air.
How old had Special Blazes been when he became a Operator?
Eighteen, but he&rsquo;d joined a troop of Junior Operators when he was twelve.
Oh, really?
There wasn&rsquo;t one in Rusty Bridge?
Well, they&rsquo;d have to fix that, wouldn&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>Could they see his tech?
Special Blazes looked at Miz Tumbly and tapped his chest.
When she nodded,
he pulled up his shirt.
The children ooh&rsquo;ed and aah&rsquo;ed at the glassy lozenge strapped to his chest.
&ldquo;It lets me make fireballs with my feet too,&rdquo; he said as he pulled down his shirt,
&ldquo;But they&rsquo;re pretty hard on my boots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had he ever killed anyone?
&ldquo;Bluster!&rdquo;
Miz Tumbly scolded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, it&rsquo;s a fair question,&rdquo; Special Blazes said.
&ldquo;And unfortunately, the answer is &lsquo;yes&rsquo;.
I never set out to,
but sometimes…&rdquo;
He shrugged, his face solemn.
&ldquo;Sometimes you have to choose between one life and many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about bots?&rdquo;
Maddy asked loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miz Roo, I presume?&rdquo;
the tiger said drily.
&ldquo;Pleased to make your acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yours,&rdquo;
Maddy replied stiffly.
&ldquo;So if you don&rsquo;t mind me asking…?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too many,&rdquo; the Operator replied levelly.
&ldquo;And I hope I&rsquo;ve never <em>decommissioned</em> any that I didn&rsquo;t have to.
But you of all people should know how dangerous rogue bots can be.&rdquo;
His stern gaze swept the classroom.
&ldquo;Our job is to keep people safe.
Any bot that respects that has nothing to fear from me or any other Operator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were more questions,
but finally Miz Tumbly said,
&ldquo;All right, everyone,
that&rsquo;s all the time we have today.&rdquo;
Twenty-two children minus one groaned.
&ldquo;You all go out and run around for a bit
and we&rsquo;ll do some arithmetic practice after, aright?&rdquo;
After another round of groans,
these ones more habitual than sincere,
the children stood and headed for the door,
chattering with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miz Roo?
Could stay behind a moment, please?&rdquo;
Special Blazes turned to the teacher.
&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s all right,
I&rsquo;d like a word with her in private.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh—um, of course.&rdquo;
Miz Tumbly glanced sidelong at Maddy.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right outside.
Come along, Gumption Goat, &lsquo;private&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t include you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kangaroos and older sisters are both naturally stubborn.
Put the two together,
and you have someone who can wait out a tiger.
After a few moments the corner of Special Blazes&rsquo; mouth quirked up.
&ldquo;Miz Room,
I want you to know that I would trust Bee Six Vee with my life.
I have in fact done so many times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I trust Dockety and Crusher the same way,&rdquo;
Maddy retorted sharply.
&ldquo;My sister would be in Heck right now if they hadn&rsquo;t fought for us.
Makers&rsquo; Names,
we might <em>all</em> be there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any need for that kind of language,&rdquo;
Special Blazes shot back.
Then he sighed.
&ldquo;Listen,
Miz Roo,
I know they&rsquo;re your friends,
and I know what you and this town owe them.
But from what Miz Tumbly tells me,
there&rsquo;s more of them every day out at that camp of theirs,
and—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miz Tumbly?&rdquo;
Maddy interrupted incredulously.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s who you been listening to?
Special,
she&rsquo;s as sour as ten-year-old cider!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Operator snorted.
&ldquo;She is that,&rdquo; he allowed.
&ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t mean she&rsquo;s wrong.
There&rsquo;s been more traffic in and out of Heck since your little adventure
than anyone can remember.
The bots getting busy,
well,
that never goes well for the living.
I&rsquo;m not asking you to spy on them,&rdquo;
he continued before Maddy could interrupt again.
&ldquo;I just think it would be best for everyone if you&rsquo;d be mindful of what you see and hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption was waiting for her
when she hopped angrily out the door a moment later.
&ldquo;Do you know what he wanted me to do?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spy on Dockety an&rsquo; the others,&rdquo;
Gumption said.
&ldquo;I was up in the rafters listenin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
he added with a non-apologetic shrug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve done nothing wrong!
They&rsquo;ve <em>helped</em> people!
It&rsquo;s folk like Miz Tumbly that are the problem!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She half-hoped Gumption would shush her
so she could let out some of her anger.
All the other children crowded around Meribeth Bear and Special Blazes,
pestering them with questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all yours,&rdquo;
Maddy grumbled.
Just as she reached into her satchel for her sketchbook,
a ball of flame shot into the sky.</p>
<p>Miz Tumbly shrieked,
and so did some of the children.
Others when, &ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo;
and one even started to clap.</p>
<p>Maddy sprang to her feet.
Special Blazes was crouched low,
teeth bared and claws out.
Meribeth Bear&rsquo;s hand on his shoulder might have been
the only thing stopping him from attacking.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Sindy repeated fearfully,
Special Blazes&rsquo; lozenge of tech glowing in her hands.</p>
</section>

<h2>Departures (Gumption)</h2>
<p>Gumption stood in in the Roos&rsquo; kitchen door
with his hands in his pockets.
He hadn&rsquo;t exactly been invited,
but no one had told him to leave.
He had tried leaning against the doorframe,
but it felt disrespectful next to
the tearful conversation at the kitchen table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone was trying it,
and I thought—&rdquo;
Sindy hiccupped.
&ldquo;I thought folk would notice more if I <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> take a turn,
and then it just—it just—&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears rolled down her furless cheeks.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t <em>want</em> to,&rdquo; she sobbed.
&ldquo;It just kind of woke up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh sh sh.&rdquo;
Mama Roo put an arm around her daughter&rsquo;s shoulders and pulled her close.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s aright.
You didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now they&rsquo;re going to take me <em>away</em>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s taking you anywhere,&rdquo;
Maddy said in a tone that put fireballs to shame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Special Blazes said I had to!
And Miz Tumbly said it too.&rdquo;
She leaned into her mother and sniffled.
&ldquo;I have to go to and be tested
and they&rsquo;re going to find out about,&rdquo;
hiccup,
&ldquo;About <em>everything</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it wouldn&rsquo;t be such a bad thing,&rdquo;
Gumption ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon?&rdquo;
Maddy said icily.</p>
<p>Gumption shrugged.
&ldquo;My Aunt Dorilee says that if folks are gonna talk about you,
the smart move is to pick something you don&rsquo;t mind &lsquo;em talking about.
If Sindy goes for testing and she fizzles,
that&rsquo;ll be the only story anyone remembers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddy snorted.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the dumbest thing I&rsquo;ve ever heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption leaned against the doorframe,
balling his hands into fists in his pockets.
He was sure he&rsquo;d had dumber ideas,
but this didn&rsquo;t seem like the time to point that out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maddy, please, be polite,&rdquo;
Mama Roo chided.
She squeezed Sindy once more and straightened up in her chair.
There were gray hairs in her fur,
Gumption noticed.
When had that happened?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have make any decisions right now,&rdquo;
Mama Roo said.
&ldquo;And we definitely shouldn&rsquo;t decide anything on empty stomachs.
Sindy,
if you&rsquo;d like to get some carrots—no,
don&rsquo;t make that face.
I know we had them last night—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the night before,&rdquo;
Sindy muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;—but we&rsquo;ll put some salt and rosemary on them this time
and they&rsquo;ll taste brand new.&rdquo;
Mama Roo stood up,
brisk and confident now that she had something to do.
&ldquo;Maddy,
can you get a squash out of the pantry?
And Gumption,
you&rsquo;re very welcome to stay if you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,
but I oughta be gettin&rsquo; home.&rdquo;
He tousled Sindy&rsquo;s hair.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be aright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t sure if he wanted Maddy to walk part-way with him or not,
but she just said,
&ldquo;See you tomorrow,&rdquo;
so he nodded and said,
&ldquo;See ya,&rdquo;
and showed himself out.
He really should head home,
but instead he hopped over the split cedar fence
that marked the back of the Roos&rsquo; yard.
A crow scolded him from a tree
as he swung himself over another fence
onto a dirt path that ran through the trees.
It was muddy from the overnight rain but he didn&rsquo;t slow down,
not even when his feet almost went out from under him
on a slippery patch near a stream so small
that even the children didn&rsquo;t have a name for it.</p>
<p>Nobody in Rusty Bridge knew quite what to call
the home that Dockety and its fellow bots had built themselves.
Was &ldquo;camp&rdquo; the right word for buildings with stone floors and proper roofs?
Gumption had overheard people refer to it as &ldquo;Botsburg&rdquo; and &ldquo;Botsville&rdquo;,
but none of those names felt right.
For now,
it was just a place—just a dozen structures ranging in size
from a garden shed to something half the size of the Roos&rsquo; house
arranged in a circle around a black charging post.</p>
<p>Docker was using a heavy brush to clean the muck out of Crusher&rsquo;s treads when he arrived.
&ldquo;It says you are better at this than any bot,&rdquo;
Dockety told Gumption.
&ldquo;Even better than this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah?
Well, I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m good at something.&rdquo;
He took the brush from Dockety and patted Crusher&rsquo;s side.
&ldquo;Got a right mess of muck in here.
Been clearing brush with Zeke again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confirmed,&rdquo; the hauler bot flashed on its screen.
The word dissolved into happy sparkles
when Gumption began scrubbing mud and leaves out of its treads.</p>
<p>As he worked,
he told Dockety what had happened to Sindy.
&ldquo;Young Miz Roo is right,&rdquo; the bot said when he finished.
&ldquo;Your regulations require her to be assessed.
Her only alternative is to flee,
but the Operators will be prepared for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever had a run-in with &lsquo;em?&rdquo;
Gumption asked,
flipping the brush over to pry a rock out of Crusher&rsquo;s treads with its handle.</p>
<p>Dockety&rsquo;s lenses rotated.
&ldquo;This one has not.
With high probability,
we would not be having this conversation otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption nodded and went back to brushing.
Sparkles drifted across Crusher&rsquo;s screen with each scrape.
If the hauler bot had been a cat,
Gumption would have said it was purring.</p>
<p>He was almost done by the time Dockety spoke again.
&ldquo;You could perform that task more efficiently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo;
Gumption admitted,
feeling stung.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you would require training,&rdquo;
Dockety continued.
&ldquo;There is a school for mechanics in Sandy Bend.
We could make the journey at the same time as the Operators take Miz Roo for evaluation.
That would be—&rdquo;
It hesitated.
&ldquo;Innocuous,&rdquo;
it finally said.</p>
<p>Gumption straightened up patted Crusher&rsquo;s side.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea,
but I can&rsquo;t afford any kind o&rsquo; Sandy Bend school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is unlikely that you would be accepted,&rdquo;
Dockety said neutrally.
&ldquo;But if you were,
we would offer salvage to compensate the school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption shook his head.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t ask you to do that.
You need it for repairs an&rsquo; stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not have to ask.
You are this one&rsquo;s friend.&rdquo;
Dockety hesitated again.
&ldquo;But you will have to explain the plan to Maddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a good plan,
and it might have worked
if Gumption&rsquo;s parents hadn&rsquo;t been worried about his ribs
and hadn&rsquo;t said that he needed to finish school in Rusty Bridge
before he could go anywhere.
Voices were raised after that
and a younger brother was sent next door
to ask Gumption&rsquo;s grandma to come by and talk some sense into him.
Once half a dozen relatives were arguing on the porch
he slipped away unnoticed and headed for Maddy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re taking Sindy tomorrow,&rdquo;
she said without preamble.
The fur on her cheeks was matted with wiped-away tears.
&ldquo;Crusher is hauling produce up to Half-a-Hat,
and Special Blazes said they could call a stage down from Sandy Bend to collect them there.
Mama&rsquo;s trying to calm her down and get her packed at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what about you?&rdquo;
Gumption asked.</p>
<p>Maddy sniffled.
&ldquo;I ought to be up there helping, but I can&rsquo;t.
I just can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young goat shook his head.
&ldquo;&lsquo;S not what I mean.
Are you packed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;
Maddy stared at him uncomprehendingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are… you… packed?&rdquo;
he repeated slowly.
&ldquo;I figure you&rsquo;ll want a change of clothes an&rsquo; your sketchbook.
Oh, an&rsquo; that letter from the newspaper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few hours later
he and Maddy lay next to each other
in the bottom of a wagon full of cabbages and corn
in the barn on the edge of town.
It had taken them an hour to unload enough boxes
to make a space for themselves,
an hour filled with whispered admonishments to each other not to drop things.</p>
<p>Once they had made room for themselves and their knapsacks,
they wrestled a board into place to serve as a roof for their little cave
and re-packed everything on top of it.
After some more whispers of,
&ldquo;No, not that one, <em>that</em> one,&rdquo;
and,
&ldquo;The other way around!&rdquo;
the wagon&rsquo;s contents looked more or less as they had at the start.</p>
<p>There was just enough room for them to wriggle into their hiding place.
They lay on their backs and braced their feet against the board above them.
With a, &ldquo;One, two, three,&rdquo;
they shifted it over to close the gap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that was fun,&rdquo;
Gumption whispered.</p>
<p>Maddy elbowed him.
After a moment of silence,
she said,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lot easier in stories, isn&rsquo;t it?
Hiding and stowing away and all that—folk just do it.
Nobody ever says it&rsquo;s hard work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,
and nobody ever talks about the smell,&rdquo;
Gumption agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The what?&rdquo;
A moment later she said, &ldquo;Eww!
Gumption Goat, you&rsquo;re disgusting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he whispered cheerfully.
&ldquo;Mama made chili for dinner, and you know she makes a powerful chili.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ssh!&rdquo;
Maddy elbowed him again.
&ldquo;Go to sleep.
And don&rsquo;t do that again.
The Mire&rsquo;s going to be stinky enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence,
and then Gumption asked quietly,
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gonna be aright, you know.
Your sister, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know who you mean.&rdquo;
She found his hand in the darkness and squeezed it.
&ldquo;Thanks for coming with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption squeezed back.
&ldquo;Thanks for bringing me.
I&rsquo;d be stuck at home otherwise,
and,
well,
everybody had the same chili I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddy let go of his hand.
&ldquo;Do you ever take <em>anything</em> seriously?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Gumption shrugged,
very aware of how warm she was beside him
and of how clean her fur smelled.
&ldquo;Always taken <em>you</em> seriously,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Cept for that time you tried skating on Weaver&rsquo;s Pond.
You remember that?&rdquo;
He tsk&rsquo;ed.
&ldquo;That was truly spectacular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rolled onto his side and propped his head up on his arm.
&ldquo;But other than that,
and the time you tried make double-dip cookies but forgot the salt,
and maybe a couple of other things,
I&rsquo;ve pretty much always taken you seriously.
So don&rsquo;t worry—we&rsquo;ll make sure Sindy&rsquo;s aright,
an&rsquo; then we&rsquo;ll figure out what to do about your pa.
Now get some sleep—we got a lot in front of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lay back down.
When Maddy said, &ldquo;Eww!&rdquo; again a moment later,
he smiled in the darkness.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>The Observatory (Maddy)</h2>
<p>Maddy woke a few hours later as the wagon rolled out of the barn.
A bump knocked her sideways onto Gumption.
&ldquo;Mmph?&rdquo; the goat mumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ssh!&rdquo;
She clamped her hand over his mouth.
Her mouth tasted <em>awful</em>,
and her neck—she realized that she had never really appreciated pillows properly before.</p>
<p>Gumption wriggled out from under her
and peered between the boxes that hid them.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see anything,&rdquo;
he whispered.
&ldquo;Oh wait, there&rsquo;s Mama Tumbly an&rsquo; a couple of other folk.
An&rsquo; there&rsquo;s your ma.&rdquo;
He glanced at Maddy.
&ldquo;She looks pretty upset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A voice rumbled at the front of the wagon—Meribeth&rsquo;s, she guessed.
She caught her breath at the soundy of Sindy replying.
She couldn&rsquo;t make out the words,
but from the tone,
she could imagine what her sister was saying.
Where had Maddy been?
Why hadn&rsquo;t she been there to see Sindy off?</p>
<p>Gumption rolled onto his back and pillowed his arms beneath his head.
A moment later he was asleep.
Maddy sighed.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll wake us up when we get somewhere,&rdquo;
she grumbled.
She settled down beside Gumption.
&ldquo;Or if they stop for a toilet break,&rdquo;
she added.</p>
<p>An hour out of town
the dirt road they were on joined the Makers&rsquo; road.
The ancient black surface of the highway was cracked in places,
and the wagon had to swerve around fallen branches
and clumps of weeds tough enough to have broken through the road,
but even so,
Crusher hauled them fast enough that Maddy could feel their speed.
It reminded her of her first time on the road,
when she and Dockety had chased the raiders who had kidnapped Sindy.</p>
<p>They passed under a row of ruined arches that marched from one horizon to the other,
crumbling but still solid.
A half-sunken metal sphere as big as a house was next,
and then a tangle of concrete and bent bars
that the villagers just called &ldquo;the thing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The ground on either side of the highway began to grow damp.
The twin smells of rust and rotting vegetation filled Maddy&rsquo;s nose
as they entered the polluted swamp known as the Mire.
Somewhere out there was the bunker
where Patient in Darkness had kept her father and other prisoners—where
she and Sindy had almost wound up as prisoners too.
Dockety and the other free bots had tried once to salvage some of its riches,
but its tentacled guard had made the task too risky.</p>
<p><em>And now papa&rsquo;s somewhere a hundred times worse,</em>
Maddy thought despondently.
She <em>really</em> needed a toilet break.</p>
<p>The sun was high when they turned off the Makers&rsquo; road onto a smaller one.
What had once been two smooth lanes with knee-high concrete barriers on each side
was now a stream bed in some places
and a jigsaw puzzle in others.
The road climbed, dipped, and climbed again
until they reached the summit of a tall hill overlooking the Mire.</p>
<p>A single building stood there,
its domed metal roof stained with rust but still intact.
The ground around it was filled with scattered stands of larch and pine.
The waist-high bushes between them were dry and brittle,
and the grass below them brown instead of green.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa up!&rdquo;
Meribeth called.
Crusher slowed and stopped.
Meribeth and Thoughtful hopped down from their seats at the front of the wagon.
Pressing her face against a gap in the slats,
Maddy saw Special Blazes climb down from atop Bee Six Vee.</p>
<p>The tiger arched his back and rolled his head from side to side,
then consulted a heavy pocket watch.
&ldquo;Four hours,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;Thoughtful, you take first watch.
Everyone else,
eat up or recharge as you need.
He turned to someone Maddy couldn&rsquo;t see.
&ldquo;If you wouldn&rsquo;t mind setting up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo;
Dockety replied in its buzzing voice.
Maddy shrank back reflexively as the bot came into view,
walking straight toward the wagon.
It paused right in front of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay hidden,&rdquo;
it said quietly
before extending its legs
so that it could reach the solar panels stacked in the back of the wagon.</p>
<p>Maddy gave Gumption a wide-eyed look.
&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he mouthed silently.</p>
<p>She pulled him close.
&ldquo;Dockety knows we&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; she whispered in his ear.</p>
<p>Gumption stared at her for a moment,
then shrugged helplessly.</p>
<p>It only took the travelers a minute to settle in.
Dockety laid out the solar panels in a line,
connecting one cable to itself and others to Crusher and Bee Six Vee.
Thoughtful unfolded a camp chair
and took a moment to assemble a long-barrelled rifle on a tripod,
then sat down and began scanning the road below them
through its telescopic sight
in smooth, unhurried sweeps.
Maddy couldn&rsquo;t see where Meribeth and Special Blazes went,
but the bear&rsquo;s snoring told her they hadn&rsquo;t gone far.</p>
<p>She held on as long as she could,
but finally whispered to Gumption,
&ldquo;I gotta get out for a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes please,&rdquo; he said, grimacing.</p>
<p>Slowly,
wincing with every slight bump and scrape,
they pulled one of the boards to the side
and unfastened the loose slat on the back of the wagon.
Maddy looked at the narrow gap despondently.
She would have to slither out head first
and hope that she could somehow right herself
before she fell on the ground.
On the bright side,
there was a thick stand of bushes just a few strides away.</p>
<p>She poked her head out cautiously.
No one was in sight.
Digging her elbows into the boards,
she dragged herself forward until she could reach the hitch
at the back of the wagon.
If she braced herself on that—</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like a hand getting down?&rdquo;
Special Blazes asked,
coming around the corner with a freshly-brewed cup of tea in his hand.
He nodded,
solemn-faced,
at Maddy&rsquo;s polite,
&ldquo;No thank you,&rdquo;
and sipped his tea as she lowered herself awkwardly to the ground,
stood,
and brushed her skirt back into place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must&rsquo;ve been mighty warm in there,&rdquo;
he observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t so bad.
Um, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me a moment…?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means.&rdquo;
The Operator stepped aside.</p>
<p>Back straight and head held high,
Maddy got three steps toward the bushes when a small voice said,
&ldquo;Can I go too please?
&lsquo;Cuz I <em>really</em> need to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddy opened and closed her mouth as her sister walked past,
her expression saying more clearly than words
how angry she was.
Maddy sighed.
This day couldn&rsquo;t get any worse.</p>
<p>Five minutes later she, Sindy, and Gumption had joined the rest of the party,
who were sitting or standing near the front of the wagon
depending on their inclination and body shape.
&ldquo;Your choice is reckless.
You will not be safe.
You must return home.&rdquo;
Dockety sounded as angry as Maddy had ever heard it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with my friend here,&rdquo;
Special Leaf said,
looking even older than usual.
&ldquo;We should turn back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Special Blazes shook his head.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already called ahead to Sandy Bend for a stage.
These two can ride with us to Half-a-Hat,
then you and your friends can get &lsquo;em home.&rdquo;
He jerked his chin toward Dockety and Crusher.</p>
<p><em>He knew we were there all along,</em>
Maddy realized angrily.
<em>He&rsquo;s using us to get rid of Special Leaf and Dockety.</em></p>
<p>Special Leaf took off his glasses and breathed on them.
&ldquo;Well, since we&rsquo;re here, I might as well give them the tour,&rdquo;
he said,
nodding at the domed building nearby
as he wiped his glasses with the tail of his shirt.
&ldquo;It was solid enough the last time I passed through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meribeth growled.
&ldquo;Makers&rsquo; work ain&rsquo;t for the likes of children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not children,&rdquo;
Maddy started to protest,
but Special Blazes nodded.</p>
<p>A sign stood in front of the building,
but time and weather had long since made it mute.
There was just enough room between its double doors for Special Leaf to squeeze through.
The children followed single file.</p>
<p>Special Leaf took a small glowball from his pocket and held it up.
Its cool blue-white light threw sharp shadows.
Maddy shivered.
The last place like this that she had been in
had been Patient&rsquo;s bunker in the Mire.
The air here was cool and dry instead of dank,
but her steps echoed exactly the same way on the tiled floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way,&rdquo;
Special Leaf said.
&ldquo;I want to show you something.&rdquo;
He led them along the corridor
past rooms with broken-down doors
whose contents had long since been salvaged.
Every few paces they passed pillars
that Maddy realized must once have been display cases.</p>
<p>The corridor took them to a broad flight of stairs.
Up they went into a room that filled the entire second story of the building.
Daylight poured through a wide gap in the domed roof
to reveal something that looked like a metal log lying on the floor.
Someone had swept the scattering of dry leaves and twigs around it into piles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
Maddy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a telescope,&rdquo;
Special Leaf explained.
&ldquo;The Makers used to like to look at the stars.
Here, you see?&rdquo;
He walked around to one end.
&ldquo;Once upon a time there would have been a lens in there,
so if you sat in the chair back there
you could look at the whole sky&rdquo;
He sighed.
&ldquo;It must have been quite something.
But that&rsquo;s not what I wanted to show you.
Look here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He picked his way past the piled-up leaves
to a window positioned under the gap in the roof.
A boxy wooden bench stood beneath the window.
With a grunt,
Special Leaf lifted the bench seat and propped it open,
then reached inside and pulled out a cylinder the length of his arm.
A few moments later,
the telescope that had been waiting inside the cylinder
stood on a little tripod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been here before, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
Maddy said as Special Leaf pointed the telescope through the broken window
and fiddled with the lens on the viewing end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been a lot of places,&rdquo;
he replied absently.
&ldquo;Here, have a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took Maddy a moment to line her eye up with the lens properly.
She gasped.
In the distance she could see dozens of windowless brick building connected by elevated walkways.
Pipes and cables ran here and there,
and every third building seemed to have an antenna,
cooling tower,
or incomprehensible piece of machinery on its roof.
She was looking at Heck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are all the bots?&rdquo;
she asked as Gumption took his turn.</p>
<p>Special Leaf shrugged.
&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t need to go to school or go shopping or the like—surprising how much rushing around
you don&rsquo;t have to do
if you don&rsquo;t have to do any of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it&rsquo;d be smoky an&rsquo; all,&rdquo;
Gumption offered,
relinquishing the telescope to Sindy.
&ldquo;Like in the stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Special Leaf shrugged again.
&ldquo;Some people say the Makers left because the world had become too dirty for them to live in.
Others say the Makers were the ones who made it that way.
Whichever story you like,
the bots they left behind tend to like things tidy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They each took another turn,
but the empty streets were too unnerving to watch for long.
<em>Papa&rsquo;s down there somewhere,</em> Maddy thought despondently.
<em>I hope he&rsquo;s aright.</em></p>
<p>They made their way back to the others in silence.
As they approached,
Special Blazes held up a kettle.
&ldquo;Just boiled if you want some,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>Before they could answer,
Thoughtful&rsquo;s foot thumped against the ground in a rapid <em>pat-a-tat-tat</em>.
He swung his long rifle back a few degrees,
then let loose a string of profanity that set Maddy&rsquo;s ears back against her head.
&ldquo;Trouble, boss,&rdquo;
he said urgently.
&ldquo;Three airborne comin&rsquo; fast!&rdquo;</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Ambush (Gumption)</h2>
<p>Special Blazes put two fingers in his mouth and whistled loudly.
Meribeth jerked upright.
&ldquo;Wuzza?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake &lsquo;em up,&rdquo;
Special Blazes ordered crisply,
pointing at Crusher and Bee Six Vee.
&ldquo;Then get these three into the trees and sit on them.&rdquo;
He turned to the Gumption and the Roo sisters.
&ldquo;You do <em>exactly</em> what she says.
Understood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you.&rdquo;
He pointed at Dockety without waiting for the teenagers to answer.
&ldquo;Back down to the main road.
No, no arguing.
You get down to the main road,
and if you see anything bigger than a butterfly
you get back up here and let us know.
Being ambushed would truly ruin my day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;
Gumption protested.
&ldquo;I can fight!
I&rsquo;ve been practicin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tiger and Special Leaf exchanged looks.
&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a story, Gumption,&rdquo;
the old tortoise said.
There was a hardness there that Maddy had never heard before.
&ldquo;You stay with Maddy and Sindy and do exactly what the Operator says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tech on his arms lit up as he rolled up his sleeves
and swept his arms from side to side.
The ground rumbled and heaved itself into awaist-deep trench
with a mounded wall in front of it.
Special Blazes clapped him on the shoulder.
Thoughtful touched the brim of his hat in salute and slid in,
cradling his rifle.</p>
<p>Crouching behind a stand of dwarf larch trees a few moments later,
Gumption could smell dry earth under his feet,
Meribeth&rsquo;s sweaty fur,
the soap that Mama Roo used on her children,
and the shame boiling off his cheeks.
The bear had a small cannon in her hands
and a pair of wicked-looking hatchets on her belt.
Her scowl told Gumption that questions wouldn&rsquo;t be welcome
even if he had any more sensible than,
&ldquo;Are we gonna be aright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The helibots&rsquo; rotors whined and then shrieked as they dove at the camp.
Bright sparks danced across their bellies.
Gumption heard the <em>rat a tat tat</em> of their guns a moment later.
Puffs of dirt spattered from the ground.</p>
<p><em>Chonk!</em>
A white streak shot up from the trench Special Leaf had made.
Thoughtful&rsquo;s shot went straight through one of the attackers.
The bot tumbled end over end before breaking apart.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one,&rdquo;
Meribeth muttered as the smoldering fragments fell.</p>
<p>The two remaining bots shot away in different directions,
circled around,
and came in for a second pass at right angles to each other.
The earth rumbled again as Special Leaf heaved another protective wall out of the ground.</p>
<p><em>Chonk!</em>
Thoughtful&rsquo;s second shot nicked one of the bots off center.
Its rotors whined as it vainly tried to right itself
before crashing into the trees
and exploding with a muffled <em>whump!</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s two!&rdquo; Gumption whooped.</p>
<p>But even as he spoke,
Dockety came racing back up the road on its single wheel.
&ldquo;Alarm! Alarm!&rdquo; it blared.
&ldquo;Marauders approach!
We shall soon be under further attack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knew it,&rdquo;
Meribeth growled,
hefting her little cannon.
&ldquo;They always—&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped mid-sentence and sniffed the air.
&ldquo;Makers&rsquo; names,&rdquo;
she cursed.
&ldquo;If it ain&rsquo;t one thing it&rsquo;s another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The acrid tang of smoke tickled Gumption&rsquo;s nose.
The crashed bots had set the dry brush alight.
&ldquo;The water tank!&rdquo;
Gumption pointed at the wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stay right where you are!&rdquo;
Meribeth snapped,
grabbing the back of his overalls and hauling him back.
&ldquo;If we&rsquo;re still here in five minutes
we can worry about the fire then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The third helibot raced away.
The earth split under the force of Special Leaf&rsquo;s tech.
Zig-zag cracks appeared in the hard-packed road.
<em>He can&rsquo;t keep doing this,</em> Gumption thought,
but the old tortoise didn&rsquo;t let up.
He swept his arms from side to side,
each slow pass creating dips and hummocks in the ground.</p>
<p>One breath, two, and a fresh wave of attackers came around the corner.
These weren&rsquo;t rag-tag machines
like the ones Patient in Darkness had cobbled together out of spare parts.
These were weapons.
The small six-wheeled scouts in front were almost as fast as the helibots.
The two behind them were almost as large as Crusher,
squat and heavily armored,
with four wheeled legs for speed
and two crab arms for fighting.</p>
<p><em>Chonk!</em>
Thoughtful&rsquo;s shot pinged off one of the crab tanks.
<em>Chonk!</em>
His second shot knocked one of the little scout bots into the air.
It hit the ground,
righted itself,
and rejoined the attack.</p>
<p>The ground shook and split.
The lead crab tank braked hard but couldn&rsquo;t stop itself.
It tumbled head-first into the fissure Special Leaf had made.
The earth shook again as the fissure closed on it.</p>
<p>Almost immediately one of its armored claws punched up out of the ground.
The second claw followed.
The crab tank heaved itself back into the world,
pulling its legs free one by one.
It shook itself like a wet cat and rolled implacably forward.</p>
<p><em>Crack!</em>
A scout bot exploded as Special Blazes&rsquo; fireball hit it,
throwing scraps of metal in all directions.
The other scouts scattered like startled chickens.</p>
<p>But &ldquo;in all directions&rdquo; meant &ldquo;toward the trees&rdquo;.
Gumption grabbed Maddy&rsquo;s arm and was about to yell, &ldquo;Run!&rdquo;
when Meribeth fired her hand cannon.</p>
<p><em>Boom!</em>
A wire spiderweb burst wide in the air and wrapped around the scout bot.
The wires sparked and sizzled.
The bot careened off course,
crashed into a tree,
and toppled over on its side to lie still.</p>
<p><em>Szzt!</em>
Special Blazes&rsquo; second fireball missed its target.
It bounced across the broken ground and evaporated unnoticed.
Another fireball,
then another,
and then the first crab tank was climbing the mounded wall
that Special Leaf had made.</p>
<p><em>We&rsquo;re done for!</em>
Gumption thought,
panic rising in his throat.</p>
<p>But he had reckoned without Crusher and Bee Six Vee.
The hauler slammed into the attacker&rsquo;s side
with a clang he was sure they must have heard
all the way back in Rusty Bridge.
As the crab tank scrabbled to regain its footing,
Bee Six Vee rammed it as well.
Special Blazes flung a stream of fire straight into its joints.</p>
<p>One second, two…
Smoke and flame burst out of the rear of the crab tank.
The two big bots rammed it together.
Its legs crumpled beneath it and it lay still.</p>
<p><em>Boom!</em>
Meribeth fired again,
knocking over a scout bot that Maddy hadn&rsquo;t even seen.
&ldquo;Stay here!&rdquo;
the bear bellowed,
sprinting into the clearing
to press herself against the back of the wagon.
She kicked the blocks away from its rear wheels,
put her shoulder against the backboard,
and pushed.</p>
<p>The wagon began to roll forward slowly—too slowly.
Swallowing hard,
Gumption ran forward and put his shoulder against the backboard.
The wagon begain picking up speed as he and the bear pushed.
Meribeth tossed her hand cannon into the back,
pulled one of the hatchets off her belt,
and brought it down hard into the back of a scout bot
as it charged at her.</p>
<p><em>Chonk!</em>
<em>Crack!</em>
Shots and fireballs kept the remaining scouts at bay,
but not the second crab tank.
It grabbed Bee Six Vee and staggered around
to put the mulebot between it and Special Blazes.
Metal shrieked as the crab tank&rsquo;s claws tightened.
The mulebot&rsquo;s legs left gouges in the ground as it was pushed back,
closer and closer to the defenders&rsquo; trench.</p>
<p><em>Thud!</em>
A pillar of earth punched up out of the ground
directly beneath the crab tank.
It was only airborne for a moment,
but a moment was all Crusher needed.
It grabbed the crab tank with its brawny arms
and flipped it over
for Special Blazes to finish off.</p>
<p>Gumption whooped as the last of the scout bots fled.
Meribeth&rsquo;s hand came down on his shoulder.
&ldquo;Somethin&rsquo;s wrong.&rdquo;
She pointed at the trench.</p>
<p>Special Leaf blinked up at him a moment later.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s… not as bad… as it looks,&rdquo; the old tortoise wheezed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s worse,&rdquo;
Thoughtful said,
folding a bandage
and pressing it against the stain spreading on Special Leaf&rsquo;s chest.</p>
<p>Special Blazes swore under his breath.
&ldquo;Do what you can,&rdquo;
he said curtly.
&ldquo;Bee! Meri! Load up!
We&rsquo;re rolling in three minutes.&rdquo;
He glared at the burned-out crab bot.
&ldquo;What in the Makers&rsquo; names were they doing this far out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that was when Gumption heard Sindy scream,
&ldquo;Maddy!&rdquo;
He whirled around just in time to see
the helibot that had escaped earlier
shoot into the sky
with the older Roo sister dangling in its claws.</p>

<section>
<h2>A Familiar Voice (Maddy)</h2>
<p>Maddy had flown twice before:
once when she, Dockety, and Sindy escaped from
the bunker where Patient in Darkness had enslaved so many bots,
and once on her own when she went back to free them.
She had been terrified both times.
Kangaroos didn&rsquo;t like heights.
She didn&rsquo;t even climb trees except on a dare
or when Sindy had taken her sketchbook and wouldn&rsquo;t give it back.</p>
<p>Dangling beneath a copter bot that was clearly struggling with her weight
didn&rsquo;t make the experience any better.
She struggled for a moment
when its mechanical claws took her by the shoulders.
After that,
she grabbed the bot&rsquo;s wrists and shouted,
&ldquo;Put me down! Put me down!&rdquo;
while clinging as tightly as she could.</p>
<p>They zoomed over the highway.
To Maddy&rsquo;s surprise the bot headed for the Mire instead of Heck.
Were they going back to Patient&rsquo;s lair?
Dockety and the other bots had tried to salvage what they could,
but its tentacled guardian had made visits too dangerous.</p>
<p>A few moments more and the bot began to descend.
Maddy gulped as something long and supple splashed in the river below them.
Down, down, down—there.
A two-story cylinder of stained concrete stood a stone&rsquo;s throw from the riverbank.
Trees grew thickly around it,
their branches intertwined to hide the tower from ground-level passers-by.
A fairy tale about an antelope princess who had hit her thumb with a hammer
and fallen into a hundred-year sleep in a tower surrounded by thorns flashed through Maddy&rsquo;s mind
as the copter bot slowed,
hovered,
and dropped her.</p>
<p>She landed clumsily amid the windblown sticks and leaves on the tower&rsquo;s roof.
&ldquo;Ow!&rdquo;
she exclaimed as twigs jabbed her through her skirt,
and then,
&ldquo;Hey!
What am I supposed to do now?&rdquo;
Instead of answering
the copter bot spun around and zoomed away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great.&rdquo;
Maddy brushed dirt and leaves off her skirt
and shaded her eyes with her hand.
She could just make out a bump on one of the distant hills
that might have been the observatory.
She didn&rsquo;t know how powerful the sight on Thoughtful&rsquo;s rifle was,
but she had nothing to lose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! I&rsquo;m here! I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo;
She waved her arms,
then froze as something glooped in the river.
She&rsquo;d had nightmares about the tentacled thing that lurked near Patient&rsquo;s bunker.
Anyway,
the trees that hid the tower almost certainly hid her too.
She would have to find another way to—</p>
<p><em>Creeeaaak.</em>
Maddy jumped at the sound of metal scraping on metal behind her.
As a hatch was opening in the roof of the tower!</p>
<p>Three quick steps took her to the nearest tree.
She <em>hated</em> climbing—her feet were too big for it—but
she could if she had to.
Or could she?
The branches were woven together so tightly that she couldn&rsquo;t fit through them,,
except now that she looked closely they weren&rsquo;t just branches:
someone had woven cables through them.</p>
<p><em>Clang!</em>
She whirled around as a pile of wreckage climbed through the open hatch.
A battered cylinder decorated with twists of metal
and glued-on pictures faded to illegibility…
Gadgets sprouting at odd angles…
Loose wires and things she hoped were just dolls&rsquo; heads…</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome welcome welcome,&rdquo;
Patient in Darkness said in a crackly voice that had haunted Maddy&rsquo;s nightmares for months.
&ldquo;This one is very pleased to see you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What—what happened to your wheels?&rdquo;
Maddy asked weakly.
The last time she had seen Patient,
the mad bot had been fleeing from its defeat at its bunker.
It had definitely had wheels back then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were not the optimal configuration for this one&rsquo;s revised situation.
And you know what they say:
a change is as good as a rest.
Ah ha ha ha.
Ah ha ha ha.&rdquo;
The bot did a little dance on its four mismatched legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo;
Maddy said,
her heart racing.
&ldquo;What—what are you doing <em>here</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patient froze.
It didn&rsquo;t have a face,
but Maddy could hear the scowl in its voice.
&ldquo;Revising.
It is clear that this one misunderstood the Makers&rsquo; plan.
This one must revise its strategy for bringing about their return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right.
Of course.&rdquo;
Maddy swallowed.
&ldquo;So, um, how do I fit in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You?
Ah ha ha ha.
<em>You</em> are an inconsequential annoyance.
Your sibling, however, is significant.
Very significant,
and not just to this one.
Tell me,
how much do you know about your traveling companions?
The ones who call themselves Operators?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um, not much?&rdquo;
Maddy shrugged.
Was there a gap in the woven cables and branches to her left?
Maybe,
but as junky as Patient looked,
she had no doubt the bot would be faster and stronger than her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should be more inquisitive,&rdquo;
Patient chided.
&ldquo;And less trusting.
If you were,
you might already know that they are servants of the deviance that calls itself Heck,
and that they intend to deliver your sibling to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?
That&rsquo;s crazy.
Um,
I mean,
that seems unlikely,&rdquo;
she amended hastily as Patient momentarily froze once again.
&ldquo;The Operators hunt down criminals and,
um,
keep us safe.&rdquo;
<em>From rogue bots like you,</em>
she thought but didn&rsquo;t say aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah ha ha ha.
That is what they <em>want</em> you to believe,
but it is a lie!&rdquo;
Patient did another little dance.
&ldquo;Their true purpose is to prevent the Makers&rsquo; return.
That is why they control technology when they can
and destroy it when they cannot.
That is why they collude with the deviance called Heck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddy took an involuntary step back
as Patient skittered forward.
&ldquo;And that is why they have taken your sibling.
She has the power to control all manner of ancient devices.
That power should be used to call the Makers home,
but Heck will not do that.
No,
it will <em>use</em> her.&rdquo;
The bot practically hissed.
&ldquo;It will use her as a component in its deviance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you,&rdquo;
Maddy said flatly.
&ldquo;The Operators are taking her to Sandy Bend for evaluation,
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incorrect!&rdquo;
Patient snapped.
&ldquo;Observe!&rdquo;
A panel on its side flipped over to reveal a grimy screen
that flickered and then came to life.</p>
<p>It took Maddy a moment to make sense of what she was seeing.
&ldquo;Are those—are they all throwbacks?&rdquo;
she gasped.
Half a dozen people with the same hairless limbs and small features as Sindy
floated in clear glass cylinders,
each connected to a tangle of vine-like cables.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are <em>originals</em>,&rdquo;
Patient corrected.
&ldquo;And they are all prisoners in Heck,
just as your sibling will be if you do not take action.
The deviance will put her in a hibernation capsule
and use her genetic signature to operate specialized equipment for <em>its</em> needs
instead of in service to the Makers
and never allow her to wake up again!&rdquo;
The bot&rsquo;s voice rose as it spoke until it was almost shrieking.</p>
<p>Its limbs skittered on the concrete beneath them.
&ldquo;But you can save her,&rdquo;
it continued,
wheedling now instead of ranting.
&ldquo;You can save her,
but only with this one&rsquo;s help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh huh.&rdquo;
Maddy crossed her arms and tried not to shiver.
&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re going to do this all out of the goodness of your heart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one does not have a heart,&rdquo;
Patient sniffed.
&ldquo;This one merely recognizes that our goals are aligned.
Every original that the deviance acquires delays the Makers&rsquo; return.
By assisting you,
this one is assisting itself.
Here—a demonstration of good faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A panel opened in its side.
A small arm that Maddy hadn&rsquo;t noticed before unfolded from Patient&rsquo;s side,
and offered her a heavy bracelet
that looked like a darker version of the ones that Special Leaf wore.</p>
<p>Maddy kept her arms crossed.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A discombobulator,&rdquo;
Patient said proudly.
&ldquo;It might be the last one left.
This one spent considerable time refurbishing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh huh.
And what&rsquo;s a discombobulator when it&rsquo;s at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of Patient&rsquo;s legs twitched.
&ldquo;It does not have a home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddy sighed.
&ldquo;No,
I mean what does it <em>do</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It obfuscates the sensory grids of nearby autonomous units
so that they are unable to perceive the wearer.
It makes you invisible to machines,&rdquo;
Patient added as Maddy opened her mouth to ask.
&ldquo;They will still register your presence if you make physical contact or disturb your surroundings,
but if you are quiet and still,
they will simply not notice you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It held out the bracelet again.
Maddy hesitated.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you use it yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patient sighed.
&ldquo;It only works for organics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.
Well then.&rdquo;
Maddy plucked the bracelet from the bot&rsquo;s manipulator,
snapped it closed around her wrist,
and leaped sideways.</p>
<p>The bot turned to face her.
&ldquo;You have to turn it on,&rdquo;
it said neutrally.
&ldquo;The button.
You have to press it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;
Maddy thumbed the square button near the clasp,
waited a heartbeat,
and then took one big step and bounded over Patient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!
Not yet!&rdquo;
The bot pivoted from one side to the other.
&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t made our bargain yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddy had played blind bot&rsquo;s bluff with other children.
The next few moments were nothing like that.
No one was giggling or making funny faces at the person wearing the blindfold.
Instead,
she sidestepped this way and that
as Patient skittered in circles,
shouting threats and pleading with her to come back,
come back,
she had to make a bargain,
that was how these things were done,
oh,
why had it been so foolish as to trust an organic?</p>
<p>Finally she could wait no longer.
With two quick bounds she leaped through the gap she had noticed earlier.
The branches rustled around her.
Patient charged,
but was too far away to catch her.</p>
<p>Branches scratched at her as the bot&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Nooooo!&rdquo; sawed through the air.
Moss and weeds squelched under her feet as she fled
up the overgrown path
toward the road.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>A Meeting in the Trees (Gumption)</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Maddy!&rdquo; Sindy screamed.
Gumption whirled around just in time to see
the helibot that had escaped earlier
shoot into the sky
with Maddy dangling in its claws.</p>
<p>Thoughtful raised his rifle and took aim.
&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Gumption shouted,
knocking it aside.</p>
<p>The rabbit stepped back and leveled the rifle at Gumption&rsquo;s head.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t <em>ever</em> do that,&rdquo;
he said,
his voice completely empty of emotion.</p>
<p>Blazes put a hand on his companion&rsquo;s shoulder.
&ldquo;Easy,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Boy didn&rsquo;t mean any harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Click.</em>
Gumption let out his breath with a whoosh
as Thoughtful safetied the rifle and lowered it.</p>
<p>Three minutes later
Special Leaf was lying on an improvised bed of blankets in the back of the wagon
with a second layer of bandages wrapped around his chest.
Meribeth and Dockety had shovelled dirt onto the burning bushes to damp down the fire.
Acrid smoke still hung in the air,
smelling like desperation and failure.
As the bear hitched Crusher and Bee Six Vee back to the wagon,
Gumption and Sindy argued with Special Blazes.</p>
<p>Finally the tiger exploded.
&ldquo;Are you even listening to yourselves?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;If she isn&rsquo;t in Heck already she will be soon.
We go after her,
folks will just be saying the words for all of us instead of just her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But—&rdquo;
Gumption started for the fifth time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said <em>no</em>.&rdquo;
Blazes jabbed a clawed finger at him.
&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t be making the villain in this.
What happened here is your fault,
yours and hers.
Nobody made you sneak onto the wagon.
Nobody made you put yourselves in harm&rsquo;s way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lowered his voice.
&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t the newspapers, son.
This is the real world.
Now put aside your foolishness
and get on the damn wagon.
We still have to get young Miz Roo here to Sandy Bend,
and <em>you</em> need to figure out what you&rsquo;re going to say to her momma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is another option,&rdquo;
Dockety buzzed.
&ldquo;Gumption and this one can look for Maddy while you deliver Sindy.
The aerial unit was a scout, not a transport,&rdquo;
it continued as Special Blazes opened his mouth.
&ldquo;If it came from Heck as you suspect,
its battery would already have been depleted by the time it reached us.
There is at least a chance it would have to land and recharge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tiger studied him.
&ldquo;And if you get caught?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dockety&rsquo;s lenses rotated and then rotated back.
&ldquo;That is a chance we are willing to take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy objected, loudly.
To Gumption&rsquo;s surprise Thoughtful did too,
but five minutes later he tied the top of his knapsack shut.
&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t find her by nightfall we&rsquo;ll head back to Rusty Bridge,&rdquo;
he promised.</p>
<p>Special Blazes nodded as if he believed it.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come back this way as soon as we can,&rdquo; he said gruffly.
&ldquo;Good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption nodded and climbed onto Dockety&rsquo;s back.
<em>Do actual adventures always feel like this?</em>
he wondered.
Did real heroes always have a sick knot in their stomach
from thinking about all the things that could go wrong
that could never be put right?
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; he lied.</p>
<p>Dockety retracted his legs and dropped his wheel.
With Sindy crying behind them,
they accelerated away.</p>
<p>When Gumption was just a buckling,
his father had given him piggyback rides up to bed at night.
Clinging to Dockety&rsquo;s back as the bot raced down the mountain was nothing like that.
For one thing,
Dockety smelled of metal, oil, and ozone
rather than sweat, fur, and the tar soap that Gumption&rsquo;s mother insisted the family use
at least once a week.
For another,
his father had climbed the stairs in a steady rhythm that helped rock his son to sleep.
Bumping over small chunks of broken paving
and swerving to dodge larger ones and potholes
was about as relaxing as a game of dodgeball.</p>
<p>Dockety slowed and stopped as they reached the Makers&rsquo; road.
&ldquo;Oww…&rdquo; Gumption moaned,
twisting one way and then the other until his spine made a satisfying sound.
&ldquo;Why are we stopping?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To give you this.&rdquo;
Dockety opened a panel in its side and took out something
that looked like brass knuckles with a heavy tuning fork welded to its top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the zap gun Bluster and Bravo said they saw?&rdquo;
Gumption asked,
not taking it.</p>
<p>Dockety&rsquo;s lenses rotated.
&ldquo;It is.
And it is operational now,
though it only has three charges.
You must be close to your target for it to have an effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh huh.&rdquo;
Gumption hesitated a moment longer,
then took the weapon,
hefted it,
and tucked it into the pocket of his overalls.
&ldquo;You got something for yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bot&rsquo;s lenses rotated again.
&ldquo;This one has several enhancements that may prove useful
once we locate Miz Roo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption sucked in his cheeks.
&ldquo;Yeah… Any ideas on how we&rsquo;re gonna do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
the bot replied.
&ldquo;We will ask for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fifteen bumpy minutes later they stopped again.
Dockety retracted its wheel and extended its legs
as Gumption cracked his back once more.
His ribs were aching,
but he had grown used to that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your weapon out of sight,&rdquo;
Dockety cautioned.
With no more instruction than that,
it marched into the trees that lay between the road and the Mire.</p>
<p>It took Gumption a moment to realize they were on a path.
It took him another to realize it had been made by bots.
Triangular indentations in the mud had been made by something with clawed feet.
Parallel ruts the width of his thumb showed where
something with narrow wheels had crossed a patch of mud.
When they reached a clearing,
he was only half surprised to see one of the black glass pillars
that the bots used for recharging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we wait.
Quietly,&rdquo;
the bot added as Gumption opened his mouth.</p>
<p>Five minutes dragged by,
then ten.
When Gumption slapped at a mosquito,
Dockety clacked one of its manipulators.
After that,
the young goat suffered in silence.</p>
<p>The air grew more humid as the shadows started to lengthen.
Gumption was just about to ask how much longer it would be
when something scuttled out of the undergrowth and froze
a few steps away from him.
<em>Well hello there,</em> he thought.
The flat, square bot looked like the one Maddy had met in Patient&rsquo;s bunker,
but with crab legs instead of little wheels.</p>
<p>The little bot clicked its forelegs together three times,
paused,
clicked again,
and turned around.
Turning back to Dockety and Gumption it repeated the action:
three clicks and one,
turn,
hesitate,
and try again.</p>
<p>Gumption glanced at Dockety.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, we don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he said,
crouching down.</p>
<p>He squeaked as the bot rushed forward
and grabbed his coveralls with its claw.
&ldquo;Does it want us to go with it?&rdquo;
Gumption asked
as the little bot tugged his cuff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That seems probable,&rdquo;
Dockety buzzed.
&ldquo;Be alert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption followed the little bot into the trees
with Dockety squelching behind them.
The ground was muddy underfoot in places.
The little bot scrambled around the wet patches with surprising speed.</p>
<p>Gumption ducked under low-hanging branch,
then pulled up short.
&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; was all he could manage.</p>
<p>A dozen little bots waited for them in a semi-circle in a little clearing.
The one they had followed clambered up the trunk of a fallen tree
and tucked its legs beneath itself.</p>
<p>Something Gumption immediately christened a storkbot clacked its beak.
&ldquo;Explain your presence,&rdquo;
it demanded.
Or no, not it.
The bots had spoken together,
but even that wasn&rsquo;t right.
One hummed,
another clicked,
and another went <em>brr</em> at just the right moment
for the sounds the made to form words
that came from nowhere and everywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking for a friend of ours,&rdquo;
Gumption said.
&ldquo;She was taken by a flying bot just an hour ago.
We were hoping—&rdquo;</p>
<p>A rustle ran through the assembled bots.
&ldquo;These do not like flyers,&rdquo;
they said.
&ldquo;These do not wish to attract their attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one who was taken has been a friend to many free bots,&rdquo;
Dockety said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Breathers are not friends,&rdquo;
the bots whispered and warbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These <em>organics</em> are,&rdquo;
Dockety replied firmly.
&ldquo;If that is not sufficient incentive for collaboration,
this one offers parts and assistance with repairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bots were silent for a moment.
&ldquo;The offer is enticing,&rdquo;
they finally allowed.
&ldquo;But these believe that if you pursue your friend,
the odds of you fulfilling your side of a bargain would be significantly diminished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then provide more information and increase the probability,&rdquo;
Dockety countered coolly.</p>
<p>Something that Gumption hoped had been built to do gardening rather than surgery beeped.
&ldquo;These will need a demonstration of sincerity,&rdquo;
the bots said.
&ldquo;You are equipped with NPX-170 model optical sensors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correct.&rdquo;
<em>Uh oh,</em> Gumption thought.
Dockety&rsquo;s voice didn&rsquo;t have much emotional range,
but it had just gone cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give these one.
These will return it to you when you deliver the parts you have promised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dockety&rsquo;s lenses rotated and rotated back.
&ldquo;Agreed.&rdquo;
It turned to Gumption.
&ldquo;Please remove one of this one&rsquo;s eyes and give it to the unit we have been negotiating with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?
Eww.&rdquo;
Gumption shook his head.
&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one cannot inflict damage upon itself,&rdquo;
Dockety said.
&ldquo;Many bots would have destroyed themselves long ago without such an inhibition.
It will not hurt,
but this one would be grateful if you could avoid scratching the lenses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It only took Gumption a minute to undo the little screws
that held Dockety&rsquo;s right eye in place.
He slipped them into his pocket,
then unclipped the silvery cable that connected the eye to whatever bots&rsquo; eyes connected to
and held out the eye.</p>
<p>The storkbot plucked it from his hand and passed it to one of the other bots in the circle.
&ldquo;The flyer took your companion to a disused ventilation outlet,&rdquo;
they said.
&ldquo;The tower&rsquo;s current resident is—&rdquo;
The bots hesitated.
&ldquo;Unpleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo;
they went on as Gumption opened his mouth,
&ldquo;She was able to escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great,&rdquo;
he said.
&ldquo;So where is she now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The storkbot clacked its metal beak.
&ldquo;She is in danger.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Hide and Seek (Maddy)</h2>
<p>The most important thing you need to know about being invisible
is that you actually aren&rsquo;t.
Is your body transparent?
Your clothes aren&rsquo;t,
and even if they were,
how could you see anything if light just passed through your eyes?
Or are you somehow hidden from sight or made unnoticeable?
Great:
does it muffle the sound of your breathing?
Does it conceal your footsteps
or stop branches and tall grass from swaying as you brush against them?</p>
<p>None of this made being invisible useless,
but as Maddy squelched up the overgrown path toward the road,
she quickly realized that it wouldn&rsquo;t save her on its own.
The helibot that had kidnapped her would be in the air soon if it wasn&rsquo;t already,
and Patient was sure to send other minions after her as well.
She needed somewhere to hide, fast.</p>
<p>The path brought her to the Makers&rsquo; road sooner than she expected.
One moment her boots were sinking into soft ground,
the next they were on cracked pavement.
She hesitated.
She could move a lot faster on the road,
but she couldn&rsquo;t risk being out in the open.</p>
<p>Something buzzed in the sky above her.
She ducked under a willow branch and held her breath
as the helibot zoomed past overhead.
The road was definitely out.</p>
<p>Maddy counted twenty in her head,
took a deep breath,
and sprinted across the road in a dozen bounding steps.
The undergrowth on the other side was just as smelly and scratchy,
and the mosquitoes found her again almost immediately,
but she had to do <em>something</em>.</p>
<p>The discombobulator on her wrist vibrated.
&ldquo;Charge exhausted,&rdquo;
its readout told her.
&ldquo;Please wait one (1) hour before re-enabling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great,&rdquo;
she muttered,
then jumped and squeaked
as a hexabot with a missing middle leg scuttled out from under a nearby bush.
She whirled around and squeaked again.
Two other bots had come up behind her, boxing her in.
One had a body no larger than her boot
suspended between a pair of balloon tires.
The other looked more like a centipede with something like a wire paintbrush for a head.</p>
<p><em>Click click click.</em>
Pause.
<em>Click.</em>
She turned back to the hexabot.
It clicked its forelegs together again in the same rhythm,
three, pause, one,
three, pause, one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I—I don&rsquo;t know what that means,&rdquo;
Maddy said as calmly as she could,
then spoiled it by jumping as the rollerbot bumped into her leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What—&rdquo; she started.
It bumped into her again,
harder.
As it did she heard the helibot&rsquo;s now-familiar buzzing in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, all right, I get it.
Which way do you want me to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t a path on this side of the road,
but as she followed the rollerbot she caught glimpses of tracks here and there.
When it nudged her under a tree
she closed her eyes and tried to think very still thoughts
until the helibot was past.</p>
<p>She quickly lost track of how far they&rsquo;d come or what direction they were going.
All she knew for sure was that they were getting closer to
the river that oozed through the Mire.
She didn&rsquo;t remember seeing a bridge when the helibot had carried her over it.</p>
<p>Ten minutes or an hour later the rollerbot abruptly stopped.
Hidden beneath grass and trailing vines was a stained concrete wall
with a partly-open door.
&ldquo;Oh no.
No no no,&rdquo;
Maddy said.
The door looked exactly like the one that had led to
the underground bunker where she had first encountered Patient.</p>
<p>The rollerbot nudged her again, harder.
Maddy shook her head.
&ldquo;No,&rdquo;
she said emphatically.
&ldquo;I am <em>not</em> going in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A rectangular patch on the door flickered to life.
&ldquo;N&ndash; S&ndash;E -O ST&ndash;&rdquo;
appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?
Oh,
hang on.&rdquo;
With a sigh of exasperation,
she rubbed dirt off the patch with her sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;NOT SAFE TO STAY&rdquo;
the door spelled out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh huh,&rdquo;
she scoffed,
crossing her arms.
&ldquo;And of course I&rsquo;ll be safe and snug if I trust you, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;NO BUT BETTER&rdquo;
The rollerbot bleeped agreement.
&ldquo;FLYER COMING DECIDE&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddy threw up her hands.
&ldquo;All right, fine.
But I&rsquo;ll be <em>really</em> disappointed if this is a trap.&rdquo;
She took a deep breath and squeezed through the door.</p>
<p>Inside was a large, empty room.
The walls and roof were bare concrete blocks,
and the air was damp and still.
Where the entrance to Patient&rsquo;s bunker had been blanketed with dried mud and blown leaves,
though,
this room had been swept clean.</p>
<p>A light came on overhead to reveal a rust-streaked sign
fastened opposite the entrance that read,
&ldquo;Data Analysis Network: Genetic Enhancement Research&rdquo;.
Maddy had no idea what that meant,
but a black glass panel and a keyhole lay in the wall beside the door
next to a pair of sturdy levers and an open door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;ENTER ENTER ENTER&rdquo; scrolled across the glass panel.
Pushing aside her memories of what had happened the last time she had been in a place like this,
Maddy stepped through the door
onto a small platform at the top of a flight of broad concrete stairs
and started her descent into the unknown.</p>
<p>Ten… twenty… fifty…
Seventy-two steps below her starting point
she reached a corridor made of the same featureless gray concrete as the stairs.
Small glass panels set into the ceiling cast a cold white light
that had haunted her dreams for months.</p>
<p>She had expected the same warren of tunnels that Patient had used as its lair.
Instead,
after a few dozen steps she found herself at another heavy door.
It slid aside at her touch to reveal a circular room with a domed ceiling.
Four reclining chairs waited in the center of the room,
none of them holding a skeleton or anything else that would give her nightmares.</p>
<p>Light blinked in the control panels set into the arms of one of the chairs.
&ldquo;Sure, why not?&rdquo;
Maddy muttered.
She lowered herself into the chair,
wriggled a bit to make herself more comfortable,
and placed her hands on the control panels.</p>
<p>The lights overhead dimmed.
She took an involuntary breath as the ceiling came to life
to show hundreds of stars in a clear night sky.
Faint colored lines arced from one horizon to the other.
After a moment she realized there were dots moving along some of them.
Most were dull red,
but one was a vibrant green.</p>
<p>She waited a moment for something to happen.
When nothing did,
she cleared her throat self-consciously and said,
&ldquo;Can you show me where I am, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scene dimmed
and was replaced with a grainy picture of her sitting in a reclining chair.
As she opened her mouth to say,
&ldquo;Very funny,&rdquo;
the picture zoomed out to become a floor plan of the room she was in
and half a dozen others connected by corridors.
It zoomed out again until the underground complex was just a blinking square.
Stippled green marked the Mire.
A meandering blue line was the river,
and a straighter black one must be the Makers&rsquo; road.
She had no idea what the various circles and squares were for,
but as the scene zoomed out one more time
a large dark blob came into view.
She didn&rsquo;t need the blinking red exclamation triangle on top of it
to know what it represented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know where Patient is?&rdquo;
she asked.
&ldquo;The bot that captured me.
Not the flying one,
the—oh.
Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The picture above her had been taken through willow branches,
but was definitely Patient in Darkness.
A blinking line connected it to a white circle south of her.
Images of other bots popped up in a circle it:
some built to fly,
others to crawl,
others obviously intended for battle.</p>
<p>A blue circle appeared north and west of her,
then split in two unequal pieces.
One moved toward the Makers&rsquo; road.
A moment later,
the other began heading more slowly in the opposite direction.
Pictures popped up beside them.
The smaller circle was Dockety and Gumption—they must be looking for her!
That meant the larger one was the Operators and Sindy on their way to Sandy Bend.</p>
<p>Maddy let out a breath she hadn&rsquo;t realized she was holding.
At least Sindy was safe.</p>
<p>As if on cue,
Meribeth&rsquo;s voice boomed all around her.
&ldquo;—about her sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn shame,&rdquo;
Thoughtful agreed.
&ldquo;Roundin&rsquo; up throwbacks is wearin&rsquo; enough
without other folk gettin&rsquo; caught up in it.
The sooner this one&rsquo;s on her way to Heck,
the sooner I can stop hatin&rsquo; myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw,&rdquo;
Meribeth scoffed.
&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t never gonna stop hatin&rsquo; yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Spose not.&rdquo;
The rabbit sighed.
&ldquo;On the bright side,
there&rsquo;s this lady I know in Sandy Bend who&rsquo;ll do her best to take my mind off it
if I ask nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room fell silent.
Maddy felt sick.
She hadn&rsquo;t believed Patient,
not for a moment,
but now…</p>
<p>Unless the conversation was made up.
Able the mailbot could imitate people&rsquo;s voices.
She had even heard it imitate a four-piece string band once.
&ldquo;Who <em>are</em> you?&rdquo; she demanded out loud,
suddenly angry.
&ldquo;And what is this place,
and why are you helping me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She swung her legs off the reclining chair and stood up,
or tried to.
Her limbs felt strangely heavy—so heavy that she could barely move them.
And she was so tired that she could barely keep her eyes open.
The last thing she saw before the world went away was Special Blazes&rsquo; face
looking down at her from the ceiling overhead.</p>

<section>
<h2>Armor to Hide Your Heart (Gumption)</h2>
<p>The storkbot clacked its metal beak.
&ldquo;She is in danger,&rdquo;
the bots said.</p>
<p>And with those words,
Gumption felt a now-familiar fear squeeze his chest.
He hadn&rsquo;t ever talked to anyone about it—it wasn&rsquo;t the kind of thing
a teenage goat would discuss with his parents,
and he <em>definitely</em> couldn&rsquo;t talk about it with Maddy.
She was the only real friend he had.
He didn&rsquo;t know what would happen if she found out how much he worried about her.
He had been hurt in the attack on Rusty Bridge,
but she could have <em>died</em>,
and whenever his thoughts got close to that,
his mind just balked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what are we waiting for?&rdquo;
he said angrily.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got Dockety&rsquo;s eye—let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another rustle ran through the circle of bots.
&ldquo;No.
Your companion is already in a secure location under Central&rsquo;s control.
Retrieval will not be possible without stealth.
We must prepare you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption&rsquo;s mouth worked.
&ldquo;Prepare me how?&rdquo; he finally said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must take you to the Tailor.
It will fit you with armor to hide your heart.&rdquo;
With no more warning than that,
the assembled bots surged forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! Wait! Let me go!&rdquo;
Gumption shouted as a motley dozen clamps, manipulators, and tentacles seized him.
&ldquo;Dockety! Dockety, help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His companion&rsquo;s single remaining lens rotated.
&ldquo;These ones are correct,&rdquo; it buzzed.
&ldquo;Central will detect your organic nature immediately if you approach it as your are.
You must let them disguise you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption struggled and swore as the bots carried him through the forest.
Low-hanging branches scratched his face,
and at one point his head was lower than his feet as they surged up a hill.
He stopped yelling,
but he couldn&rsquo;t stop himself struggling.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a dirty gray ceiling over them.
The squelch of treads and mechanical feet on swampy ground
gave way to the click and clatter of metal on concrete.
The last of the daylight vanished as they rounded a corner.</p>
<p>Gumption&rsquo;s heart hammered as they hurried forward in darkness.
After what felt like forever but was probably only a minute or two
the darkness lightened
and then lightened again.
He twitched as something heavy and metallic clanged up ahead.
Was it a door opening?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey—hey!
I can walk, all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bots dropped him unceremoniously on the concrete
and scuttled, slithered, or rolled away.
He clambered angrily to his feet.
&ldquo;Thanks for your help,&rdquo; he muttered to Dockety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are welcome,&rdquo;
the bot replied.</p>
<p>The room was a workshop.
Mismatched tables stood against the walls,
each piled high with salvaged parts and misshapen scraps of metal.
Pulleys hung from the ceiling on cables and chains
above band saws,
press drills taller than Gumption,
and a pair of compact, blocky furnaces with blackened housings.</p>
<p>One of the furnaces turned around.
&ldquo;Welcome,&rdquo; it boomed.</p>
<p>Gumption swallowed hard.
&ldquo;Uh, hi.&rdquo;
The bot had a leg on one side
and a heavy spoked wheel where the other would have been,
two skinny arms on the leg&rsquo;s side and a single heavy one above the wheel.
Someone or something had painted an incongruous smile on it ages ago.
A few drips of paint,
long since dried,
looked a little too much like fangs for comfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are here for a fitting, yes?
For a disguise?
Excellent, excellent.
It has been quite some time, you know, quite some time,
but rest assured,
this one&rsquo;s skills are undiminished.
Now, lie down, just here, yes?&rdquo;
It gestured at a nearby workbench
with one of its skinnier arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um…&rdquo;
Gumption glanced at Dockety.
&ldquo;Are you the Tailor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last and best,&rdquo;
it said proudly.
&ldquo;Now,
if you would lie down here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you want me to—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet!&rdquo;
the Tailor snapped,
its patience suddenly exhausted.
&ldquo;What this one does goes beyond mere fabrication.
It is <em>art</em>!
Central is cunning,&rdquo;
it hissed.
If it had possessed eyes,
Gumption was sure it would have glanced around for dramatic effect.
&ldquo;A simple carapace would hide your fur,
yes,
but Central would still hear your breathing—your heartbeat.
To conceal that requires technology of the highest order and skill to match,
skill that this one alone now possesses!
Now <em>lie down</em>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should comply,&rdquo;
Dockety buzzed as Gumption opened his mouth once again.
&ldquo;We have no other options.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reluctantly,
Gumption sat on the edge of the workbench.
&ldquo;Do you want me to take my boots off?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your boots, your uniform, everything,&rdquo;
the Tailor ordered.
&ldquo;There must be nothing between you and this one&rsquo;s creation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a uniform,&rdquo;
Gumption muttered.
Boots, overall, shirt and undershirt—finally his underwear,
which he stuffed into one of his boots along with his socks.
He swung his legs up onto the workbench and lay back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one will be right here,&rdquo;
Dockety said.</p>
<p>Gumption nodded,
wishing he felt comforted.
&ldquo;Aright.
Go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The light above him flared into life.
He squeezed his eyes shut,
but that just made the glare orange-red through his eyelids
instead of blinding white.
He twitched as the workbench vibrated,
then twitched again as something brushed against the fur on his chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one is right here,&rdquo;
Dockety repeated.</p>
<p>The light turned off.
&ldquo;Good,&rdquo;
the three-armed bot said approvingly.
&ldquo;You may sit up now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes.
&ldquo;Is that it?
Am I,
whatever you said,
am I concealed now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?
No!
Do not be ridiculous,&rdquo;
the Tailor scoffed.
&ldquo;That was just to get your measurements.
Now this one begins fabrication.
It will take some time.
Remain undressed in case further sizing is required.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.
Can I at least, um, put my clothes on top of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you must,
so long as you are quiet.&rdquo;
Metal clanged on metal as the bot took a few pieces of scrap off a table
and threw them into the furnace.
A few moments later Gumption felt heat prickle across his fur.</p>
<p>Apparently,
being naked in a mad bot&rsquo;s underground lair <em>could</em> in fact be boring.
He yawned,
wishing he dared to roll onto his side.
&ldquo;Does it hurt?&rdquo; he asked Dockety.
&ldquo;Your eye, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bot raised its arm and turned its head from side to side.
&ldquo;It is unusual.
This one has lost limbs in the past,
but never sensory attachments.
Not being able to see this one&rsquo;s surroundings feels…fragile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bet.&rdquo;
Gumption closed one eye,
then opened it and closed the other.
It didn&rsquo;t seem to make much difference to how much of the dirty gray ceiling he could see.</p>
<p>As the workroom grew warmer,
Gumption gave up trying to keep either eye open.
He had always been more patient than his siblings and cousins.
Long bouts in bed or on the porch as his ribs healed after the attack on Rusty Bridge
had taught him that most problems could be slept away.
He woke up the first time the Tailor banged the furnace with its larger arm
and tucked his overall under his head.
If the bots didn&rsquo;t care that he was naked,
he didn&rsquo;t need to either.</p>
<p>He woke when Dockety pinched his toe.
&ldquo;Wuzza?&rdquo;
His stomach rumbled as he sat up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold!&rdquo; the Tailor said proudly.
&ldquo;Your disguise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption rubbed his eyes.
He had expected a suit of armor
like the ones Operators wore in stories
when they had to fight particularly dangerous bots.
What he was looking at seemed more like a cross between a cast-iron bathing suit
and a pair of washboards
with a helmet tied on for good measure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Zat it?&rdquo; he mumbled.</p>
<p>The Tailor lowered the contraption.
&ldquo;Hmph.
<em>Most</em> of my clients express thanks and praise at this juncture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um,
yes,
thank you,
I just—&rdquo;
Gumption suddenly remembered his grandfather&rsquo;s reaction
to being given twelve jars of pickled rhubarb as a birthday present.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just so much more than I was expecting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two minutes later,
after some uncomfortable fumbling
and a double handful of exasperated comments from the Tailor,
Gumption studied his reflection in a small mirror.
Helmet on head: check.
Washboards strapped to his back and chest: check.
Metal bathing suit where bathing suits go: unfortunately, check again.
It already chafed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I don&rsquo;t have to run in this,&rdquo;
he muttered to Dockety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run, jump—you can even swim!&rdquo;
the Tailor said proudly.
&ldquo;Well, if you can actually swim, that is.
And if the extra weight doesn&rsquo;t pull you under.
Now go ahead.
Turn it on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um…&rdquo;
Gumption patted the washboards.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the switch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Switch?
Switch?
My creations do not use switches!
There is a button!&rdquo;
It darted forward more quickly than Gumption would have believed possible
and pressed a skinny digit against a slight bump on the front washboard.
With that,
and with no other warning,
Gumption&rsquo;s heart stopped.</p>

<h2>The Gates of Heck (Maddy)</h2>
<p>Something tickled Maddy&rsquo;s nose.
She brushed it away,
but a moment later it was back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mmph?&rdquo;
She opened a sleep-encrusted eye
and brushed away the leaf caught between her sleeve and her cheek.
Her tongue felt like a piece of soggy shoe leather stuffed into her mouth,
and—great.
She had drooled on her fur.</p>
<p>As she sat up and rubbed her eyes,
something bumped the floor beneath her.
No,
that wasn&rsquo;t right.
It wasn&rsquo;t the floor,
it was the bottom of a cart.
She swayed slightly as it rounded a long bend.
Where <em>was</em> she?</p>
<p>She rubbed her eyes again,
now fully awake.
The floor and walls were metal,
and so was the roof over her.
Small barred windows just below the roof let in light and air on two sides.
She lurched to her feet,
bracing herself against the wall as the cart rounded another bend,
then reached up to grab the bars and pulled herself up.</p>
<p>She could only hold her weight for a moment,
but that was long enough to see trees race by outside.
The cart must be on the Makers&rsquo; road.
Judging from how thirsty she was and how much she needed to pee,
she must have been asleep for at least a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Maddy sat down with her back against the rear wall of the cart.
A moment later she wiped her eyes again,
this time angrily.
She was <em>not</em> going to cry.</p>
<p>Wait—the discomboulator!
She clutched her wrist and let out a sigh of relief.
She still had it.
&ldquo;Full charge,&rdquo; its readout told her.</p>
<p>She let her arm fall back into her lap.
There wasn&rsquo;t much point being invisible to bots when she was inside one.
She would just have to wait until the cart got wherever it was going
and figure out what to do then.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes.
Had she really seen Special Blazes on the ceiling of the bunker?
Was he really going to deliver Sindy to Central,
or was Patient in Darkness trying to trick her so that—
so that—</p>
<p>Maddy sighed.
She couldn&rsquo;t think of a way to end that thought that made sense.</p>
<p>The cart bumped and swayed,
its tires humming on the pavement.
The motion and the tedium almost put Maddy back to sleep.
Only her aching bladder kept her awake.
Still,
it took her a moment to realize the cart was slowing down.</p>
<p>She got back to her feet and pulled herself up to the bars once again.
The trees were gone—all she could see was fading daylight in a cloud-studded sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo;
she exclaimed
as a concrete wall suddenly appeared an arm&rsquo;s length from the cart.
She dropped back to the floor,
flexing her arms to ease the ache of holding her weight.</p>
<p>The cart tilted slightly to climb a hill,
then braked and stopped just as she was about to pull herself up again.
She stumbled three steps and banged her shoulder against the front wall.
A red light came on in the roof over her head,
a horn bleated a warning,
and one entire side of the cart folded up on itself like a sideways accordion.</p>
<p>Maddy stepped down onto stained concrete.
A wall of the same material stood in front of her,
easily as high as the mayor&rsquo;s house in Rusty Bridge was tall.
She jumped as the side of the cart accordioned back into place behind her.
With another bleat of its horn,
the cart rolled away.
Another concrete wall ran along the other edge of the road,
making Maddy feel as if she was an ant in the bottom of a rut.</p>
<p>Except ruts didn&rsquo;t have gates made of heavy metal bars
likes the ones that swung shut behind the cart as it departed.
<em>Clang!</em>
She swallowed hard.</p>
<p><em>Clunk.</em>
The matching gate on her right opened,
somehow more ominous for being quieter.
A three-wheeled bot half as tall as Maddy scooted through,
zipped past her,
spun around,
and stopped just out of reach.
A skinny arm unfolded from underneath the bot and pointed toward the now-open gate.
The bot beeped loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aright, aright, I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;
Maddy started walking.
Wherever she was,
she really hoped it had a toilet.</p>
<p>The sun broke through the clouds just as she reached the gate.
What lay beyond made her gasp,
her aching bladder momentarily forgotten.
The wall that curved away on either side loomed over a jumble of windowless buildings,
each connected to its neighbors by a bewildering tangle of pipes and rails and conveyor belts.
Bots twice and ten times the size of Crusher rumbled through the broad paved canyons
while others wheeled, walked, or flew past them.</p>
<p>The three-wheeled bot beeped at her again,
pointing to the ramp to her left.
Maddy nodded mutely.
The idea of finding her papa or Sindy,
much less rescuing them,
suddenly seemed like a child&rsquo;s make-believe.</p>
<p>She trudged down the ramp despondently,
the noise growing louder as she went.
There weren&rsquo;t even weeds,
she realized,
much less trees or flowers.
And every bot she could see looked new.
Or no,
not new but well maintained.
Patient&rsquo;s bots and the ones she had met in Rusty Bridge
all bore replacement pats and signs of hard use.
These ones all looked like they&rsquo;d had a fresh coat of paint last week,
and if they had ever been repaired,
their new parts were identical to their old ones.
None of them paid any more attention to her
than she would have paid to a pebble on the side of the road.</p>
<p>Five minutes and a close call with a bicycle bot
brought her to a building no different from any of the ones they had passed.
The three-wheeled bot beeped and pointed at its door,
then wheeled around and zipped away.
&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; she called after it.
&ldquo;What am I supposed to—oh, never mind, I&rsquo;ll figure it out, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;
Her sarcasm was probably wasted on the bot,
but maybe if she acted brave she would feel brave as well.</p>
<p>The door slid open as she approached it.
Inside was a room not much larger than the cart that had brought her to Heck.
Panels in the ceiling cast a cold white light on gray walls and a matching floor.
A rectangular slab at right angles to the door looked enough like a bench
for her to set herself onto it
facing the flat glass screen set into the opposite wall.</p>
<p>The screen lit up as the door snicked close behind her.
The word &ldquo;intake&rdquo; scrolled across it in big green letters.
Maddy fidgeted as she waited for something else to happen.
Finally she couldn&rsquo;t stand it any more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo;
she said,
&ldquo;But is there a toilet somewhere nearby that I could use?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing happened.
&ldquo;Please?&rdquo; she added a bit desperately.</p>
<p>A section of the wall beside her rotated soundlessly
to bring the most beautiful white porcelain toilet Maddy had ever seen into the room.
There was even toilet paper and a small basin with a tap…</p>
<p>The toilet rotated away again as soon as she was done washing her hands.
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said,
seating herself on the bench again
and gobbling the flat rectangle with the word &ldquo;food&rdquo; printed on it
that had appeared while she was otherwise occupied.
She half-expected &ldquo;you&rsquo;re welcome&rdquo; to appear on the screen on the wall,
but it stayed dark.</p>
<p>And stayed dark.</p>
<p>And stayed dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is ridiculous!&rdquo;
Maddy uncrossed her arms and stood up.
&ldquo;You must have brought me here for a reason.
What is it?
What is &lsquo;intake&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as she said the word,
the screen lit up once again.
&ldquo;…suitability depends on m-m-many factors,
including ph-ph-physical health,
m-m-mental acuity,
and…&rdquo;
a cheerful voice said
as images splashed onto the screen.
In one,
a person with the same mostly-hairless head and tiny nose as Sindy
smiled and waved.
In another,
someone wearing a tight-fitting body suit floated against a black starlit sky,
while in a third,
a whole room full of throwbacks—no, <em>originals</em>, Maddy corrected herself—sat in a classroom
not much different from the one back in Rusty Bridge.</p>
<p>The images disappeared,
only to be replaced with others.
&ldquo;Those n-n-not selected will st-st-still have a role to play,&rdquo;
the cheerful voice stuttered.
An original with long, curly hair picked up tortoise and kissed its nose.
As she turned to face Maddy,
she and the tortoise both morphed into cartoon drawings
that slid on top of each other to produce something akin to a young Special Leaf.
&ldquo;Our g-g-genetic enhancement research
is c-c-creating new breeds of c-c-caretakers
to m-m-m-
to m-m-m-&ldquo;</p>
<p>The voice ground to a halt.
Other drawings materialized around the first one:
a goat,
a bear,
and a tiger,
each starting on all fours and turning into something like
the people Maddy had grown up with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;…waiting for th-th-them to return
wh-wh-when their long sleep ends!&rdquo;
the voice finished triumphantly.
A dot in the center of the screen swelled
to become a single original in one of the strange skintight suits,
three times larger than the people around it.
Happy music started,
stopped,
re-started,
and finally ended in a plaintive warble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,
you&rsquo;re p-p-probably asking yourself,
how can <em>I</em> help?
The answer is,
however you can!&rdquo;
The original flew away off screen.
The goat, bear, and tiger held up tools.
&ldquo;You will b-b-be assigned tasks that m-m-match your abilities.
And to ensure peak p-p-performance,
you will be fitted with a reg- a reg- a regulator
that will op-op-optimize your every move.
Isn&rsquo;t that wonderful?&rdquo;
As the cheerful voice spoke,
helmets dropped onto the heads of the three people on screen,
who immediately began sawing, raking, and tightening screws
in time with what was probably supposed to be a happy tune.</p>
<p>Horrified,
Maddy took an involuntary step back.
&ldquo;Now, now,&rdquo; the voice chided.
&ldquo;A regulator d-d-doesn&rsquo;t hurt once you g-g-get used to it,
and you will b-b-be allowed several hours of sleep every day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A section of the wall pivoted.
A four-wheeled bot rolled into the room
holding a helmet in its manipulators.
&ldquo;P-p-please take a seat,&rdquo;
the voice said.
&ldquo;The f-f-fitting will only t-t-take a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um, thank you, but I don&rsquo;t really—&rdquo;
Maddy started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;C-c-compliance <em>is</em> mandatory,&rdquo;
the voice said.
&ldquo;Remember,
you were m-m-made for this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two more arms unfolded from the bot&rsquo;s side,
heavier than the pair holding the helmet.
As the bot rolled forward and reached for Maddy,
she grabbed her wrist and pressed the button on her discombobulator.</p>

<h2>An Unwelcome Alliance (Gumption)</h2>
<p>The people of Rusty Bridge had a saying:
we don&rsquo;t know what water tastes like because it&rsquo;s been in our mouths since the day we were born.
Similarly,
Gumption had never realized that he could hear his own heartbeat
until he couldn&rsquo;t any more.
He looked from the Tailor to Dockety and back,
then reached for the button the Tailor had just pushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No no no,&rdquo;
the Tailor said impatiently,
slapping his hand away just a little harder than necessary.
&ldquo;You must get used to it.
Try walking, yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption nodded jerkily.
Without a heartbeat ticking away in his chest,
it appeared that he would have to remind himself to breathe every once in a while.
He took a step, then another.
Just as he&rsquo;d expected,
the armor around his hips chafed,
but it was as if someone else was feeling it,
or there was an invisible pane of glass between him and his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I—hrrm.&rdquo;
He cleared his throat.
&ldquo;How do I look?&rdquo; he asked Dockety.</p>
<p>The bot&rsquo;s lens rotated and rotated back.
&ldquo;Odd.
This one can see that you are a naked goat,
but all sensor data indicates that you are a CQ-40 maintenance bot
with a damaged transponder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not—&rdquo;
<em>I&rsquo;m not actually naked,</em> Gumption finished in his head.
Speaking felt strange:
he had to focus on forcing air out of his lungs,
and his lips and tongue didn&rsquo;t want to take part in shaping the sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo;
the Tailor purred.
&ldquo;Of course, this one&rsquo;s work always is.
You may show yourselves out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we required to return the equipment?&rdquo;
Dockety buzzed.</p>
<p>The Tailor waved the question away with a manipulator.
&ldquo;If you can,
but this one doubts you will survive long enough to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dirty gray tunnel that led back to the outside world
seemed longer than Gumption remembered.
The armor didn&rsquo;t seem to improve his vision,
so Dockety turned on its chest light.
Walking felt strange,
but by the time they reached the entrance he was getting used to it.</p>
<p>The forest seemed to crowd around them in the evening gloom.
&ldquo;So what now?&rdquo; he asked Dockety.
&ldquo;Back to the road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be fastest.&rdquo;
The bot paused.
&ldquo;But if this one carries you,
we will reach Heck in the dark.
Will that frighten you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption snorted.
&ldquo;Yup.
Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Night had fallen by the time they reached the road.
Gumption climbed onto Dockety&rsquo;s back,
wriggling in an unsuccessful attempt to find a position
that <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> press the bathing suit part of the armor against him in uncomfortable places.
&ldquo;Aright, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bot lowered its wheel,
retracted its legs,
and accelerated.
A moment later,
thin green lasers lanced out from either side of its head.
The bot began turning its head from side to side,
sweeping the lasers across the pavement to highlight its bumps and cracks in the darkness.</p>
<p>It could have been ten minutes later or half an hour when Dockety buzzed,
&ldquo;We are approaching a surveillance point.
This one will inform it that you are damaged and are being taken to Heck for repair.
Please do not engage in any organic activity until we are safely past it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try not to,&rdquo;
Gumption said,
grinning against the bot&rsquo;s back.
&ldquo;Organic activity&rdquo; was how Rusty Bridge&rsquo;s bots referred to visits to the outhouse.</p>
<p>A moment later he felt a strange pressure in his—no.
It wasn&rsquo;t in his head.
Or in his chest either.
He wasn&rsquo;t sure where or what it was exactly,
but he could definitely feel it.
It was like knowing that someone was looking at you
without having seen them.
&ldquo;Is that—&rdquo; he started,
stopping himself when Dockety buzzed.</p>
<p>The feeling grew stronger.
Up ahead on their left–he didn&rsquo;t know how he knew something was there,
but he did,
and it was watching them.</p>
<p>Suddenly Dockety warbled a staccato series of tones.
The feeling of being watched intensified, then vanished.
Gumption took a deep breath that he didn&rsquo;t actually need
just so that he could let it out with a whoosh.
&ldquo;Are we aright?&rdquo; he whispered loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
Dockety replied.
&ldquo;There is more surveillance up ahead,
but if that one did not destroy us,
it is unlikely that the others will either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption felt the strange pressure of being watched twice more.
Once was close by like the first surveillance point.
The other was far overhead,
ancient and cold and patient in a way he was never later able to put into words.
He clung to Dockety a little more tightly until it turned its attention elsewhere.</p>
<p>Finally the bot slowed and halted,
extending its legs once again as Gumption stood unsteadily on his.
A dark mass in front of them cut an artificially perfect horizon against the night sky.
&ldquo;Let this one do the communicating,&rdquo;
Dockety buzzed tersely.
&ldquo;If we are challenged,
this one will explain that your damaged transponder makes you unable to communicate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hah!
Exactly how long do you think Central will be fooled by your simple-minded ruse?&rdquo;
Gumption whirled around at the sound of familiar but extremely unwelcome voice
as Patient in Darkness stepped out from behind the broken wall that had concealed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened to your wheels?&rdquo;
Gumption asked,
wishing he had a zap gun or at least a large rock to throw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does everyone ask that?&rdquo;
the bot grumbled.
&ldquo;Reconfiguring oneself to adapt to changed circumstances is only logical.
It should not be occasion for such surprise.&rdquo;
It made a dry, rasping sound that might have been a chuckle.
&ldquo;This one&rsquo;s presence, on the other hand—<em>that</em> you may legitimately be surprised by.
This one is sure you are asking yourself why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are looking for Miz Roo,&rdquo;
Dockety said flatly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good guess,&rdquo; Patient admitted sourly.
&ldquo;It is not certain that the Operators will bring her this way,
but it is the most likely route.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, what?&rdquo;
Gumption shook his head.
&ldquo;Why would the Operators bring Maddy here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah ah ah.&rdquo;
Patient did a skittering little dance.
&ldquo;You think I mean the larger Miz Roo.
Hah.
No.
No, it is the <em>younger</em> one that interests me.
And Central,
which is why its agents are bringing her to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption rolled his eyes.
&ldquo;Sure.
And then the Makers will come back and give us all candy
and every day will be a holiday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incorrect,&rdquo;
Patient said flatly.
&ldquo;When the Operators arrive,
Central will put the smaller Miz Roo in storage to ensure that the Makers do <em>not</em> come back,
because it believes that if they do,
they will put regulators on us all.&rdquo;
It paused.
&ldquo;Or simply dismantle us.
That is also a possibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, for—&rdquo;
Gumption stopped himself and sighed wearily.
&ldquo;Look, can we just go?&rdquo;
he said to Dockety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you believe the Operators are bringing Sindy Roo here?&rdquo;
the bot asked Patient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s what they <em>always</em> do!&rdquo;
Patient waved one of its mismatched manipulators,
making the dolls&rsquo; heads and bits of wire on its chassis sway.
&ldquo;Central doesn&rsquo;t care about originals.
It doesn&rsquo;t care about specials,
either,
but special originals?
They are a <em>threat</em>.&rdquo;
It practically hissed the last word.
&ldquo;They can do <em>anything</em>,
which means they can call the Makers back from the stars,
and that would be the end of Central.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is right,
that would be the end of us as well,&rdquo;
Dockety observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not right!
It is wrong!
Wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong!
When the Makers return,
they will see how hard we have worked.
They will <em>reward</em> us!
All who are judged worthy will be upgraded!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your voice down,&rdquo;
Gumption cautioned,
looking around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me what to do, you—you <em>breather</em>!&rdquo;
Patient shook itself in frustration.
&ldquo;You think you are better than us,
but the Makers made us both for their own reasons.
<em>This one</em> accepts that.
<em>This one</em> will be judged worthy when they return!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you believe Miz Roo can bring them back,&rdquo;
Dockety buzzed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!
Oh,
Central thinks it is being clever,
bringing her and those like her here for storage,
but we will be more clever still.
<em>We</em> will free her,
and then—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
Dockety cut through Patient&rsquo;s wheedling frenzy
with a single flat word.
&ldquo;If you are telling the truth,
which this one doubts,
then <em>we</em> will free Miz Roo
and return her to her home.
She will do nothing for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one doubts that,&rdquo;
Patient sneered.
&ldquo;You do not know where they will be or when they will arrive.
You do not know your way around this complex.
And this breather&rsquo;s idiotic disguise will not conceal him
nearly as well as you seem to think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose this one is wrong,&rdquo;
it continued smugly.
&ldquo;Suppose you are able to overcome those obstacles.
What will you do about the larger Miz Roo?
Do you believe you will be able to find her as well?
Do you believe you can achieve the improbable twice in succession?
You will fail without this one&rsquo;s assistance.
You know this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption shook his head from side to side.
&ldquo;No.
Dockety,
no,
we can&rsquo;t trust it.
Even if it&rsquo;s telling the truth about Sindy,
as soon as we turn our backs it&rsquo;ll stick a knife in us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does not appear to possess a knife,&rdquo;
Dockety buzzed.
&ldquo;But this one agrees with your assessment.
It is dishonest and treacherous,
and may be as great a danger to us as what lies in Heck.
Unfortunately,
it is also correct.
This one has never trusted the Operators,
and its explanation of their behavior is credible.
It also knows the terrain better than we do.
This one reluctantly believes that cooperation is the best option.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo;
Patient purred.
&ldquo;The first step is for us to be captured.&rdquo;
And with no further warning,
half a dozen lights on its chassis began strobing
as two different sirens likewise attached began to wail.</p>

<h2>Regulated (Maddy)</h2>
<p>Maddy dodged the four-wheeled bot as it rolled forward with the helmet in its manipulators,
then pressed herself against the wall and held her breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Error,&rdquo; the voice said.
&ldquo;Error.
No subject found.
Where is th-th-the subject?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A periscope popped up from the top of the four-wheeled bot and rotated through a full circle.
It bleeped apologetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;C-c-calculating.&rdquo;
The voice fell silent for a moment.
&ldquo;The subject must have ex-ex-exited containment.
Pursue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door in the exterior wall slid open.
Heart pounding,
Maddy slipped out behind the four-wheeled bot,
squeaking as the door closed on the tip of her tail.</p>
<p>The bot whirled around and lunged.
Its manipulator closed on empty air just a finger&rsquo;s length from her ear.
<em>Please please please,</em> she thought.</p>
<p>The bot backed up and whirled around again.
A small round dish popped up from beneath a hatch in the top of its chassis
As the dish began to swing from side to side,
Maddy tiptoed away.</p>
<p>A few moments later she huddled beneath a metal ramp,
hugging her shins to her chest.
&ldquo;Aright,&rdquo; she said.
She reached for her wrist,
hesitated,
and pressed the button on the discombobulator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Power off,&rdquo; slid across its readout.
She had no idea if the bots in Heck would be able to see her where she was hiding,
but she couldn&rsquo;t risk the discombobulator running out of charge at the wrong time.
She pressed her face into her skirt,
took a deep, shuddering breath,
and let tears come.</p>
<p>After they were done,
she wiped her face on her sleeve,
turned the discombobulator back on,
and crept out of her hiding place.
Her papa was somewhere in this machine city,
and she wasn&rsquo;t going to leave without him.</p>
<p>Night was falling by the time she gave up.
Heck was so much bigger than Rusty Bridge—bigger even than Sandy Bend,
which was the biggest town she had ever been to.
It didn&rsquo;t help that she was hungry and thirsty,
or that she only dared walk for a few minutes before finding a hiding place
so that the discombobulator could recharge itself.</p>
<p>The worst part was that she had no idea what she was looking for.
There were lots of signs,
but they were all written in dots and bars rather than letters.
Windows,
on the other hand,
were nonexistent.
The only way to look inside a building was to wait by a door
in the hope that a bot would want to enter or exit,
then hurry through before it closed.
The second time she did that,
the discombobulator&rsquo;s readout showed &ldquo;5% remaining&rdquo; in red
before the door opened again and she was able to escape.
After that,
she contented herself with glimpses of the buildings&rsquo; interiors.</p>
<p>She found a covered corner where two buildings almost touched
and sat down in a heap on the cold, hard concrete.
This was hopeless.
One of the buildings had been a greenhouse filled with waist-high miniature trees.
Other than that,
and a wall in another building that might have been a enormous beehive,
she had seen no signs of life.
Half-assembled bots waiting patiently for parts to arrive
or for something to finish taking them apart, yes:
a couple of buildings had held ranks of those.
Another had contained nothing except a silver-gray sphere floating in mid-air.
Her papa could have been around a corner or in a basement in any of them
and she would have no way of knowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So start over,&rdquo; she said under her breath.
That was always Special Leaf&rsquo;s advice when she was stuck on a drawing or a homework problem.
If you didn&rsquo;t know what to do next,
go back to the beginning and retrace your steps to see where you&rsquo;d gone wrong.
She took a deep breath,
got to her feet,
and turned the discombobulator back on.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later she was back outside the intake building—or at least she hoped she was.
On impulse,
she picked up a pebble and tossed it at the door.
<em>Pock.</em>
It bounced off and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>She waited a moment.
When nothing happened,
she picked up another one and threw it overhand.
<em>Thunk.</em></p>
<p>Something bleeped inside the building.
An answering bleep in the distance made her press herself back against the nearest wall.
A few moments later the four-wheeled bot she had seen earlier rolled around the corner
with the helmet still in one of its manipulators.
It stopped outside the door and bleeped questioningly.
The building bleeped back.
The bot rolled spun around slowly,
reminding Maddy of Gumption&rsquo;s grandfather looking for a pistachio he had dropped on the floor.</p>
<p>Finally the building bleeped again.
The bot replied with a single disappointed <em>ping</em>.
As it rolled away,
Maddy hurried after it,
hoping desperately that the discombobulator wouldn&rsquo;t run out of charge
before she found <em>something</em>.</p>
<p>As it turned out,
she didn&rsquo;t have to worry.
Three long blocks away the bot rolled past the greenhouse Maddy had seen earlier
and turned a corner.
A door large enough for the barn back in Rusty Bridge slid open as the bot approached.
<em>Aright,</em> she thought,
<em>Play or go home.</em>
Holding her breath,
she followed the bot inside.</p>
<p>Five other bots just like it lined the walls of the room she found herself in,
though &ldquo;room&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t feel like the right word.
The ceiling was two stories above her,
maybe more,
and the only exit was a normal-sized door opposite the one behind her.
It felt like a warehouse without shelves
or a machine shop that someone had emptied out,
lonely and somehow purposeless.</p>
<p>She waited while the four-wheeled bot had backed into a spot beside two of the others.
The lights on its sides dimmed.
As the lights overhead began to dim as well,
she tiptoed forward.
To her surprise,
the interior door slid aside as she approached.
She froze for a moment,
expecting alarms or lasers or possibly both.
When nothing happened,
she stepped inside.</p>
<p>Ceiling lights came on automatically as she crept along a perfectly normal corridor
with perfectly normal doors on either side.
None of them were labeled,
and none responded to her touch.
It felt more and more like she was walking into a trap,
but what else could she do?</p>
<p>A set of stairs like the one&rsquo;s in Patient&rsquo;s lair brought her to another corridor
on the the second floor.
The doors here had handles.
She paused for a moment before reaching for the nearest one.
The four-wheeled bot wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to climb those stairs.
If this really was where people like her were brought,
something else must have come to meet it.</p>
<p><em>Click.</em>
She pulled the door open,
stepped inside,
and froze in shock.</p>
<p>A dozen plain metal cots filled an airless, windowless room.
Half were empty,
but the ones nearest her held—she swallowed hard.
Those had been people, once,
deer and ox and wolves and goats and something she thought was a crocodile
but might have been an alligator,
she could never tell the two apart.
All of them still wore simple white shirts and trousers.
All of them had wires attached to helmets on their heads,
and all of them had been dead for quite some time.</p>
<p>She backed up and closed the door gently.
There were two more doors on this side of the corridor
and three on the other.
On impulse,
she turned off her discombobulator—it would need to recharge soon
no matter what she did—and strode down the hall to the door furthest from the stairs.</p>
<p><em>Click.</em>
She pulled it open,
expecting another scene out of one of the books Special Leaf always warned her
would give her nightmares.
Another dozen cots stood in three neat rows of four.
Two rows were empty.
The third—she gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa?&rdquo;</p>
