<h1>In Heck</h1>



<section>
<h2>Mail (Maddy)</h2>
<p>Maddy was sketching the willow tree in the main square of Rusty Bridge
when one of the Ox brothers hollered,
&ldquo;Mail&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo;
<em>Finally</em>, she thought,
giving her drawing one last despairing look.
The branches were in the right places,
but somehow the lines on the page didn&rsquo;t capture
the drooping greenery on the willow in front of her.</p>
<p>She sighed and tucked her sketchbook into
the blue canvas satchel her father had made for her tenth birthday.
A lot had happened since then,
but at least now she knew he might still be alive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waitin&rsquo; on anythin&rsquo; in particular?&rdquo;
a familiar voice drawled behind her.</p>
<p>Maddy jumped.
Mayor Lupus smiled down at her,
a mug of tea in her hand.
It was a kindly smile,
but it still showed a lot of teeth.
&ldquo;Mama sent off for some seeds,&rdquo; Maddy said.
&ldquo;And my chores were all done, and—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;—and it&rsquo;s a beautiful day so why not sit for a bit?&rdquo;
the old wolf finished, nodding agreeably.
She jerked her chin toward Maddy&rsquo;s bag.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; a lot better.
Your pa would be pleased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Maddy mumbled.
Mayor Lupus had a way of looking at you
that made you feel like she could read your mind.
That was part of why the village kept electing her:
most people felt guilty just thinking about running against her.</p>
<p>A double handful of people gathered to gossip as they waited for the mail.
Zeke Bear had finally fixed the smokehouse
that had been knocked down during the attack a few months ago.
He might not especially like the bots who had helped save them,
but he would allow that they were useful.
And the Ox brothers&rsquo; apple orchard was draining properly
for the first time in forever,
and there wasn&rsquo;t a dull pair of scissors in town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, having that sort about makes me feel uncomfortable,&rdquo;
Miz Nabbles sighed loudly,
shaking her graying mane.</p>
<p>Mayor Lupus tipped the dregs of her tea into a planter.
&ldquo;I reckon how we feel is our problem, not theirs,&rdquo;
she said conversationally.
&ldquo;And if any trouble shows up, well…&rdquo;
She rapped her gnarlywood cane against her mechanical leg.
&ldquo;Fightin&rsquo; bots is a lot easier when you have a few on your side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miz Nabbles&rsquo;s whiskers twitched at the rebuke.
She had put herself forward for election the year before,
but had garnered even fewer votes than the mayor&rsquo;s previous challenger.
&ldquo;Folks might think it&rsquo;s time for a change,&rdquo;
Mama Roo had explained to Maddy afterward,
&ldquo;But if she&rsquo;s what change looks like, they&rsquo;d rather wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aaaaand right on time,&rdquo;
Mayor Lupus said as the mailbot came into view.
Eighty-Eight Able-Six (&ldquo;but call me Able&rdquo;) looked like three metal boxes
perched on top of one another
with a single small wheel up front
and two spoked cartwheels in the rear.
It only had one arm,
and like many free bots
it had patches and welds from years of mending,
but someone had made it a blue hat with a little tin badge,
which it wore proudly wherever it went.</p>
<p>Able rolled to a halt and doffed its hat.
&ldquo;Good morning, one and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made good time,&rdquo;
the mayor said as Able opened a hatch in its side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a lift in from Sandy Bend,&rdquo;
the bot replied,
opening a hatch in its side.
&ldquo;Big fella haulin&rsquo; some passengers.
They oughta be along shortly.
Now, let&rsquo;s see—I got letters,
I got parcels,
even got a newspaper from Sandy Bend.&rdquo;
Its periscope cameras swivelled from side to side
as it handed out what it had brought.</p>
<p>Someone bumped Maddy&rsquo;s elbow.
&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo;
Gumption said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; she said back.
He had slicked down his fur the way some of the older goats did.
It made them look tough,
but—she stifled a sigh.
He just looked like he&rsquo;d been caught in a rainstorm.</p>
<p>She would have told him that six months ago,
but he&rsquo;d changed since the bot attack.
It had taken him a long time for his ribs to heal.
Once he was back on his feet he had started using the punching bag
in Zeke Bear&rsquo;s barn
and doing militia drills with an old pike.
And while they still saw each other almost every day,
her half-admitted hope that
they would do more than play checkers and read the same books
were still just hopes.</p>
<p>Gumption jerked his chin at the mailbot.
&ldquo;Anything for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was about to say, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; when Able called her name.
She traded a glass penny for a letter in a plain brown envelope
with &ldquo;Miz Madalena Roo, Rusty Bridge&rdquo; written on its front
in strong, square letters.</p>
<p>Maddy took a slow breath.
&ldquo;Well? Aren&rsquo;t you gonna open it?&rdquo;
Gumption asked.</p>
<p>She shook her head.
&ldquo;Not here.
You want to go look in on Special Leaf?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption shrugged.
&ldquo;Sure.
Has he got Sindy doin&rsquo; magic tricks again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ssh!&rdquo;
Maddy glanced around involuntarily.
Special Leaf insisted that they keep her sister&rsquo;s abilities secret.</p>
<p>Gumption shrugged again.
&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he muttered,
and then,
&ldquo;Hey—look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in tarnation?&rdquo; Mayor Lupus exclaimed.
A murmur ran through the crowd
as two bots entered the square
with a pair of muddy, sullen goats between them.
Dockety was in the lead,
its mis-matched arms swinging as it strode toward the crowd.
Its companion Crusher brought up the rear on heavy treads,
and in between—</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are those boys <em>tied up</em>?&rdquo;
Miz Nabbles gasped,
her ears folding down in shock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet down,&rdquo; Mayor Lupus said sharply.
The crowd parted to let her through,
her cane clicking on the cobblestones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; she said to Dockety.
&ldquo;I thought Able had brought all the mail,
but it seems you have somethin&rsquo; for us too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lenses on the front of Dockety&rsquo;s head rotated a quarter turn and back
with a faint <em>zick zick</em>.
&ldquo;These ones were apprehended
while attempting to take items that do not belong to them,&rdquo;
it said,
its voice buzzing slightly.
&ldquo;We request punitive measures to deter further attempts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mayor Lupus sucked in her cheeks.
&ldquo;Is that right, boys?
Were you stealin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No we wasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
Bluster Goat protested vehemently.
&ldquo;We were just tryin&rsquo; to find out if they been hidin&rsquo; stuff,
and we did!
They got weapons stashed away!
All kinds of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said quiet down!&rdquo;
Mayor Lupus snapped as people began muttering.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty serious accusation, Mister Goat.
You best be sure of your ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo seen &lsquo;em too,&rdquo; Bluster said.
His twin brother nodded vigorously.
&ldquo;Big pile o&rsquo; stuff laid out in one o&rsquo; those sheds they been buildin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are not weapons,&rdquo;
Dockety buzzed.
&ldquo;They are spare parts.
Many of us still require repairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spare parts my tail!&rdquo; Bluster said hotly.
&ldquo;They got a zap gun an&rsquo; saw blades and all sorts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dockety?
Any o&rsquo; that true?&rdquo;
the mayor asked.
Her tone was still light,
but her ears had flattened too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These possess several saw blades,&rdquo; the bot acknowledged.
It gestured at Crusher.
&ldquo;This one has been using them to clear brush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the zap gun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not operational.&rdquo;
The bot&rsquo;s lenses rotated back and forth again.
&ldquo;But if we are able to repair it,
we will use it only for defensive purposes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Says <em>you</em>,&rdquo;
Miz Nabbles muttered,
just loudly enough to be heard.</p>
<p>Mayor Lupus scowled at her,
then turned her look on Dockety.
&ldquo;Would have been neighborly to let us know you had that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Understood,&rdquo; Dockety said.
&ldquo;These will do so in future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you two,&rdquo;
the mayor continued,
turning to the goat twins.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your place to be pokin&rsquo; around like that.
No,
don&rsquo;t interrupt me,
that&rsquo;s just going to make me cranky.
You&rsquo;re both on ditch weeding duty for the next month,
and if you do somethin&rsquo; lump stupid like this again
you&rsquo;ll be lookin&rsquo; back on ditches like they were apple pie.
You got that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bluster opened his mouth to protest,
but snapped it shut when his twin kicked his leg.
&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m,&rdquo; they said in sullen unison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then.&rdquo;
Mayor Lupus nodded at Dockety to untie them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of here,&rdquo; Bluster snapped at his brother
once they were free.
They stalked away side by side,
their boots clomping on the cobblestones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those boys make me <em>so</em> mad!&rdquo;
Maddy grouched to Gumption.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;d be chained up in Heck or worse
if it weren&rsquo;t for Dockety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess,&rdquo;
Gumption said noncommittally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think so?&rdquo;
Maddy demanded hotly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo;
Gumption protested.
&ldquo;But Miz Nabbles was by for tea yesterday,
and she and my ma and pa were all sayin&rsquo;
we don&rsquo;t really know much about them.
I like havin&rsquo; &lsquo;em here,&rdquo;
he added hastily,
anticipating Maddy&rsquo;s outrage.
&ldquo;But she said—Miz Nabbles, I mean—that they call us &lsquo;breathers&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we call &lsquo;em a lot worse than that,&rdquo;
Maddy snapped.</p>
<p>Gumption threw up his hands.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t!
I like &lsquo;em better than I like a lot o&rsquo; people,
you know that!
I&rsquo;m just sayin&rsquo; a lot of folks aren&rsquo;t as quick with change as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever Maddy might have said next was cut off
by a pair of voices shouting,
&ldquo;Fight! Fight!&rdquo;</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>The Operators (Gumption)</h2>
<p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo;
Mayor Lupus asked,
exasperated,
as the twins ran back into the square.</p>
<p>Bluster bent over and put his elbows on his knees to catch his breath.
&ldquo;Some travelers just come off the road!&rdquo;
Bravo panted.
&ldquo;An&rsquo; the bots are fightin&rsquo; with &lsquo;em!
They got guns an&rsquo; tech an&rsquo; everythin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever Mayor Lupus might have said next was cut off
by a sizzle and a sharp <em>crack!</em>
A fireball shot into the air from the other side of the blacksmith&rsquo;s,
leaving a trail of smoke behind it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; Mayor Lupus barked,
jabbing a finger at Maddy.
&ldquo;Fast as you can,
go an&rsquo; get Special Leaf!
The rest of you, stay here!&rdquo;
She shouldered past the gaping onlookers
and hurried off behind the twins
as another fireball followed the first into the sky,
her cane and prosthetic leg rapping the cobblestones
in an uneven staccato.
People exchanged looks and followed her.</p>
<p>Gumption wathced Maddy run off without a backward glance.
He took one step after her,
swore,
and fell in behind the crowd instead.</p>
<p>He caught up with them in time to hear Mayor Lupus shout, &ldquo;Enough!&rdquo;
Dockety and Crusher stood side by side on the street facing three strangers.
The rabbit had a long rifle on her shoulder
and a slouch hat pulled down over her ears.
The six-legged mulebot beside her had a wagon hitched behind it.
Its heavy armor put Special Leaf&rsquo;s shell to shame.</p>
<p>Behind them both stood a tiger with a black patch over one eye,
his hands raised as if to play dodgeball.
She wore a dark green jacket with black collar and cuffs
that matched the rabbit&rsquo;s
and the camouflage on the mulebot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Operators,&rdquo; Gumption breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No kidding.&rdquo;
Bluster elbowed him hard,
but his eyes were just as wide as Gumption&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone mind explainin&rsquo; what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on here?&rdquo;
Mayor Lupus said,
her tone making it clear that &ldquo;no thank you&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t an acceptable answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My apologies, Miz Mayor,&rdquo;
the tiger replied,
lisping slightly around his fangs.
&ldquo;Are these two friends of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re neighbors,&rdquo;
she allowed,
flicking an ear.
&ldquo;But you do have me at a disadvantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Special Blazes at your service,&rdquo;
the tiger replied,
tapping a finger against the brim of his hat.</p>
<p>The crowd let out its collective breath.
&ldquo;I <em>knew</em> it,&rdquo; Bluster said reverently.
Special Blazes was <em>famous</em>.
Every story in the newspaper about his exploits said so:
&ldquo;The famous Special Blazes has triumphed again!&rdquo;
The Case of the Snorkeling Smugglers,
the Shootout at Half-Heart Pass,
his year-long pursuit of
the villainous Mattock sisters—Gumption had devoured them all
despite Maddy&rsquo;s disdain for &ldquo;sensationalism&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,
Special,
it&rsquo;s an honor to have you here,&rdquo;
Mayor Lupus said.
&ldquo;Oh,
and may I introduce Special Leaf?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elderly tortoise had appeared with Maddy at his elbow.
He was wearing a shapeless gray sweater
that Mama Bear had knit for him the winter before last,
and had an old blue scarf wrapped around his neck as well
despite the sun&rsquo;s warmth.
He peered at the Operators through his little round glasses
as if trying to decide whether they were books that needed re-shelving.</p>
<p>The rabbit lowered his rifle and doffed her hat.
Special Blazes nodded.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an honor,&rdquo; he rumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, thank you,&rdquo;
Special Leaf said in a slightly fuddled tone.
&ldquo;As the mayor says,
Crusher and Dockety are neighbors.
I&rsquo;m sure they didn&rsquo;t mean to scare you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rabbit muttered something that may or may not have been,
&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t scared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tiger lowered his hands.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear it.
My apologies if we overreacted.&rdquo;
<em>LIKEWISE</em> scrolled across the screen
set into the front of the mulebot.</p>
<p>Mayor Lupus turned to Dockety.
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said as the moment stretched.
&ldquo;Anything you&rsquo;d like to stay to the Special?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bot&rsquo;s lenses rotated.
&ldquo;Welcome to Rusty Bridge.&rdquo;
It buzzed static at Crusher,
who lowered its own massive arms reluctantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,
I&rsquo;m glad that&rsquo;s sorted,&rdquo;
Special Leaf said brightly.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d like some tea,
you&rsquo;d be very, um…&rdquo;
He gestured vaguely in the direction of his house.</p>
<p>Special Blazes dipped his head.
&ldquo;Thank you,
but what we&rsquo;d like most right now is a chance to wash up
and chat with the mayor.&rdquo;
The mulebot made a grinding noise.
&ldquo;Oh,
and our bot wouldn&rsquo;t mind a bit of oil and a chance to recharge,&rdquo;
he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we can manage all of that,&rdquo;
Mayor Lupus said.
She waved the Operators toward the square and followed them,
chatting with Special Blazes.
The townspeople dithered and buzzed for a few moments,
then decided in ones and twos
that their chores weren&rsquo;t going to do themselves
and headed for home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ever seen Operators before?&rdquo;
Gumption asked Special Leaf.</p>
<p>The old tortoise nodded.
&ldquo;Not in some years,&rdquo; he replied quietly,
all traces of fuddlement gone from his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think they&rsquo;re here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Special Leaf shook his head.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.
But please,
be very, very careful what you say,
especially around Blazes.
He is every bit as smart as the stories say,
and the less he knows about Sindy,
the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The threesome walked back to Special Leaf&rsquo;s house in silence.
&ldquo;Done for the day?&rdquo;
Maddy asked her sister once they were inside,
ruffling the hair on top of Sindy&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just let me finish this chapter,&rdquo;
Sindy said without looking up from her book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome to take it with you,&rdquo;
Special Leaf said gently.
The battle with the bots
had added more wrinkles to Special Leaf&rsquo;s green-gray hide,
but his eyes were still bright behind his little round glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is the most exciting part!
Please?&rdquo;
Sindy pleaded.</p>
<p>Maddy looked at Gumption, who shrugged.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind waiting.&rdquo;
He was supposed to spend the day weeding his family&rsquo;s vegetable garden.
It wasn&rsquo;t the worst job in the world,
but even if he wore his father&rsquo;s waxed cotton slicker
his fur would get soaked and muddy,
and stooping over would make his half-healed ribs ache.
On the other hand,
at least Maddy had asked before making a decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five minutes,&rdquo;
Maddy told her sister sternly.</p>
<p>Special Leaf nodded toward the kitchen.
The two teenagers followed him into it.
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s she doing?&rdquo; Maddy asked
as Gumption plopped himself down in his usual chair,
then winced at a twinge in his ribs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo;
the old tortoise said.
He fished a small metal-rimmed rectangle of black glass out of his pocket.
&ldquo;I came by this up years ago.
Never knew what it did,
but she picked it up this morning
and all of a sudden there were pictures floating in the air above it.
Except they weren&rsquo;t really pictures,&rdquo;
he continued,
looking wistfully at the bit of ancient tech.
&ldquo;They looked as solid as any of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great,&rdquo; Gumption said when Maddy didn&rsquo;t respond.
Sindy was one of those rare people with no tail,
no whiskers or scales,
and no fur except for the wiry black tuft on her head.
When other children wanted to be cruel they called her a throwback,
but every piece of tech she touched responded to her.</p>
<p>The look on Maddy&rsquo;s face told Gumption that
she was worrying yet again about
what might happen if people found out about Sindy&rsquo;s gift,
so he elbowed her in the ribs to distract her.
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to tell him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Special Leaf wrinkled his forehead,
which was as close as he could get to raising his nonexistent eyebrows.
Maddy reluctantly pulled the letter out of her satchel.
&ldquo;I was wondering when that would arrive,&rdquo; Special Leaf said.
He opened the breadbox on the counter behind him,
took out a butternut cookie,
and offered it to Maddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this for?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s good news, for celebrating,&rdquo; Special Leaf said.
&ldquo;And if it&rsquo;s not,
well,
at least you&rsquo;ll have a cookie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption elbowed Maddy again.
&ldquo;Just <em>open</em> it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She swallowed,
tore the envelope open,
and unfolded the beige rectangle of paper inside.
Her face fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, muck,&rdquo; Gumption said,
patting her awkwardly on the shoulder.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.
&ldquo;No.
No.
They—&rdquo;
She laughed shakily.
&ldquo;They said yes.
They&rsquo;re going to publish it.
They&rsquo;re going to put my drawing in the newspaper!
Woo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hugged Gumption impulsively,
then turned to Special Leaf with a grin as wide as a sunrise on her face.
&ldquo;Congratulations,&rdquo; he said
as she took an enormous bite out of the cookie.</p>
<p>Later that night,
Gumption lay in his narrow cot
and listened to the raindrops drip off
the cottonwood outside his attic bedroom.
The sound matched his mood perfectly.
He was happy for Maddy,
he really was.
Having one of her drawing published in a newspaper
mattered almost as much to her
as saving Rusty Bridge from a band of marauding bots.</p>
<p>It was great news,
but it also meant she was that much closer
to leaving for somewhere better
full of people as smart and as talented as she was.
He&rsquo;d known since their first conversation about books at Special Leaf&rsquo;s
that she would be going some day.
He just wished that day wasn&rsquo;t getting closer quite so fast.</p>
<p>He nearly fell out of bed when something rapped softly on his window.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Bout time,&rdquo; he muttered,
getting quietly to his feet.
He had oiled the shutter after dinner to prevent it squeaking,
and the nearest branch of the cottonwood was an easy stretch away.</p>
<p>Dockety waited patiently for him at the base of the tree.
&ldquo;Thank you again for warning this one about your cousins&rsquo; plan,&rdquo;
it said without preamble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome.&rdquo;
Gumption hesitated.
&ldquo;So what did you find out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bot&rsquo;s lenses rotated back and forth.
&ldquo;He is still alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption swallowed hard,
even though it was what he&rsquo;d hoped to hear.
&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,
but he is the right age, gender, and body form,
and Central&rsquo;s records of him start at the right time.&rdquo;
A single drip trickled down the bot&rsquo;s head like a tear as it spoke.
&ldquo;It will be difficult to obtain more information.
We can only communicate when—&rdquo;
Dockety paused.
&ldquo;You do not have the words.
There are little moons above this world,
placed in the sky by the Makers.
We can only interrogate Central when they are in the right positions,
and even then,
we only dare do it briefly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption shook his head.
He didn&rsquo;t understand the part about &ldquo;little moons&rdquo;,
but that didn&rsquo;t matter.
&ldquo;Is he aright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is—&rdquo;
Dockety paused again as it searched for the right word.
&ldquo;He is functional, but not optimal.
There are machines in the facility that only work for organic operators.
This is why Central takes your people.
The facility was not designed to sustain them.
They usually do not last very long.
If we are going to attempt a rescue,
we must act soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sudden thought struck Gumption.
&ldquo;What about the Operators?&rdquo; he asked excitedly.
&ldquo;They must know <em>tons</em> about places like this!
I can bring &lsquo;em out here to meet you and—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;
Dockety&rsquo;s voice buzzed sharply.
&ldquo;You must not involve them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption ran a hand over his head and flicked away the drops.
&ldquo;Why not?
They&rsquo;re just tryin&rsquo; to keep folk safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo;
Dockety responded.
&ldquo;But who keeps us safe from them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption sighed.
&ldquo;Aright.
Thank you for findin&rsquo; out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he reached for a branch of the cottonwood Dockety asked,
&ldquo;What are you going to tell Miz Roo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno yet.&rdquo;
Gumption grunted at the pain in his side
as he pulled himself up into the tree.
He had a lot of thinking to do.
Not for the first time,
he wished he had someone he could do it with.</p>

<h2>School (Maddy)</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Miz Nabbles,&rdquo;
Maddy said the next morning with half-hearted sincerity.
She and Sindy had gotten to school
just as Rusty Bridge&rsquo;s other children were finishing
a ragged rendition of the Plea to the Makers.
Miz Nabbles glared at Sindy even more sternly than usual
as the sisters slipped into their seats.
<em>Please let it be a normal day,</em>
Maddie thought.</p>
<p>But it was not to be.
&ldquo;Class—class!
Settle down, please,&rdquo;
Miz Nabbles said in her braying voice.
&ldquo;How many of you know what a Operator is?&rdquo;
Every hand shot into the air.
&ldquo;And how many of you know that
we actually have some Operators here in Rusty Bridge <em>right now</em>?&rdquo;
Hands strained to reach even higher
as an excited murmur rippled through the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
Miz Nabbles said indulgently,
&ldquo;If you all promise to be <em>very good</em>,
we have a special treat today.
Everybody find a partner.
No,
Jessamyn,
you can&rsquo;t be your own partner,
just—yes, Filbert, anyone will do.
All right?
Two by two,
then,
let&rsquo;s go outside for our surprise!&rdquo;
She sighed as twenty-two children scrambled for the exit,
their partners forgotten.</p>
<p>Gumption was the last one through the door.
&ldquo;Oh wow,&rdquo; he breathed,
then added,
&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo;
when Maddy shot him a look.
There,
in the center of the more-or-less rectangular field behind the school,
stood Special Blazes and the rabbit who had arrived with him.
Both wore their uniform trousers,
but instead of their jackets they were in plain tunics
no different from a farm hand&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get outta-come on, I wanna see.&rdquo;
Bluster and Bravo shouldered their way through the other children
to stand front and center.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there you are.
I didn&rsquo;t see you in class,&rdquo;
Miz Nabbles said acidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doin&rsquo; chores,&rdquo;
Bluster lied without looking at her.
He elbowed his twin.
&ldquo;Look at the size of &lsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tiger&rsquo;s ear twitched.
Without warning he crouched and roared.
Everyone jumped,
and a few of the smaller children squeaked.</p>
<p>Special Blazes straightened and bared his teeth in a smile.
&ldquo;Good morning.
Who can tell me what we just learned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you&rsquo;re really scary!&rdquo;
Bluster called,
scowling when Bravo made a kissing sound beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I try,&rdquo;
Special Blazes said modestly.
&ldquo;But the real lesson is surprise.
If you&rsquo;re ever in trouble—if you&rsquo;re ever attacked
by bots or anyone else—try to surprise them.
Do something unexpected.
Like this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He scooped up a wooden baton from the grass by his feet
and swung it at his companion&rsquo;s head.
Maddy heard it cut the air,
but the rabbit was faster.
She twisted sideways to avoid the first blow,
ducked to avoid the second,
then threw a kick that would have knocked the tiger halfway across the field
if it had landed.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t.
Instead,
the tiger spun the baton around to knock the blow aside,
then stepped in close and brought his hand up to the rabbit&rsquo;s throat.
&ldquo;Aaaand you&rsquo;re dead,&rdquo; he said pleasantly.</p>
<p>Some of the children clapped,
Sindy and Gumption among them.
When Maddy scowled at them Gumption looked away
and the younger Roo stuck out her tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh come now,&rdquo;
Special Blazes said,
&ldquo;You can do better than that for my friend Thoughtful,
can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So here&rsquo;s the second lesson,&rdquo;
the tiger said as the children applauded.
&ldquo;Training wins.
Training beats size and speed and everything else you can think of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about tech?&rdquo;
Bluster asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even tech,&rdquo;
Thoughtful said,
a lazy twang in her voice.
She took the baton from Special Blazes,
spun it around,
and settled into fighting stance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo;
Gumption muttered,
elbowing Maddy.
&ldquo;This is pretty neat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddy crossed her arms.
&ldquo;You think so?
I notice they didn&rsquo;t invite the bot that was hauling the wagon for them.
I wonder how it feels about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever Gumption might have said was lost amidst &ldquo;oohs&rdquo; and &ldquo;aahs&rdquo;
as the tiger&rsquo;s raised fists burst into flame.
He winked at the children,
the roared and threw himself at Thoughtful.
The flurry of punches, kicks, and whirlwind baton strikes that followed
was too fast for Maddy to follow.
Special Blazes threw one fireball after another.
The rabbit batted them aside,
somehow finding time to strike at her opponent in between.</p>
<p>And then Thoughtful threw the baton at Special Blazes&rsquo; head.
As he ducked,
she bounced forward and grabbed the front of his shirt.
&ldquo;Gotcha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woo hoo!&rdquo; Bluster whooped.
&ldquo;That was <em>amazing</em>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was certainly well rehearsed,&rdquo;
a familiar voice said.
Special Leaf had come up behind her
while she was watching the Operators&rsquo; mock battle.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity that real fights aren&rsquo;t so well organized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Maddy could ask him what he knew about real fights,
the old tortoise raised his voice.
&ldquo;That was very impressive,
Special Blazes,
very impressive indeed.
But if you&rsquo;ll forgive my memory,
I&rsquo;m a little puzzled.
I thought you traveled with a bear named Meribeth.
No offense to, um, Thoughtful, is it?
No offense, of course, but what happened to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tiger&rsquo;s smile widened
even as an uncomfortable look flitted across the rabbit&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;We parted ways some while back,&rdquo;
the tiger rumbled.
&ldquo;Amicably,
I&rsquo;d say,
but she decided it was time for her to follow her own road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miz Nabbles clapped her hands loudly to fill the awkward silence that followed.
&ldquo;All right, um, thank you,
thank you very much for that.
Now how about we all line up and go <em>back into the classroom</em>
and we can ask the Operators about
all the <em>other</em> things they know how to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Special Leaf put his hand on Maddy&rsquo;s arm as she started to turn around.
&ldquo;If he asks you questions, tell him the truth,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;Just remember that you don&rsquo;t have to tell <em>all</em> the truth.&rdquo;
She nodded,
a little frightened by the intensity in the old tortoise&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>She and Gumption join the line behind the goat twins.
&ldquo;We <em>got</em> to be Operators,&rdquo; Bluster told his twin excitedly.
&ldquo;Did you see how they—blam! blam!&rdquo;
He threw a couple of punches at the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was aright,&rdquo;
Bravo allowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bet they rehearsed the whole thing,&rdquo;
Maddy muttered,
remembering what Special Leaf had said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better than drawin&rsquo; stupid little pictures,&rdquo;
Bluster shot back.
Maddy scowled but didn&rsquo;t reply.</p>
<p>The children settled into their seats.
Special Blazes stood at the front of the class
with his hands clasped behind his back.
&ldquo;Now, who has questions?&rdquo; Miz Nabbles asked.</p>
<p>Hands shot into the air.
How old had Special Blazes been when he became a Operator?
Eighteen, but he&rsquo;d joined a troop of Junior Operators when he was twelve.
Oh, really?
There wasn&rsquo;t one in Rusty Bridge?
Well, they&rsquo;d have to fix that, wouldn&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>Could they see his tech?
Special Blazes looked at Miz Nabbles and tapped his chest.
When she nodded,
he pulled up his shirt.
The children ooh&rsquo;ed and aah&rsquo;ed at the glassy lozenge strapped to his furry chest.
&ldquo;It lets me make fireballs with my feet too,&rdquo; he said as he pulled down his shirt,
&ldquo;But they&rsquo;re pretty hard on my boots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had he ever killed anyone?
&ldquo;Bluster!&rdquo;
Miz Nabbles scolded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, it&rsquo;s a fair question,&rdquo; Special Blazes said.
&ldquo;And unfortunately, the answer is &lsquo;yes&rsquo;.
I never set out to,
but sometimes…&rdquo;
He shrugged, his face solemn.
&ldquo;Sometimes you have to choose between one life and many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about bots?&rdquo;
Maddy asked loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miz Roo, I presume?&rdquo;
the tiger said drily.
&ldquo;Pleased to make your acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yours,&rdquo;
Maddy replied stiffly.
&ldquo;So, <em>have</em> you ever killed any bots?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have <em>decommissioned</em> a few,&rdquo; the Operator replied levelly.
&ldquo;Though I hope never any that didn&rsquo;t deserve it.
But you of all people should know how dangerous rogue bots can be.&rdquo;
His stern gaze swept the classroom.
&ldquo;Our job is to keep people safe.
Any bot that respects that has nothing to fear from me or any other Operator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were more questions,
but finally Miz Nabbles said,
&ldquo;All right, everyone,
that&rsquo;s all the time we have today.&rdquo;
Twenty-two children minus one groaned.
&ldquo;You all go out and run around for a bit
and we&rsquo;ll do some arithmetic practice after, aright?&rdquo;
After another round of groans,
these ones more habitual than sincere,
the children stood and headed for the door,
chattering with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miz Roo?
Could stay behind a moment, please?&rdquo;
Special Blazes turned to the teacher.
&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s all right,
I&rsquo;d like a word with her in private.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh—um, of course.&rdquo;
Miz Nabbles glanced sidelong at Maddy.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right outside.
Come along, Sindy Roo, &lsquo;private&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t include you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kangaroos and older sisters are both naturally stubborn.
Put the two together,
and you have someone who can outwait a tiger.
After a few moments the corner of Special Blazes&rsquo; mouth quirked up.
&ldquo;Miz Roo,
regarding your question,
I&rsquo;d like you to know that I would trust Bee Six Vee with my life.
I have in fact done so many times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I trust Dockety and Crusher the same way,&rdquo;
Maddy retorted sharply.
&ldquo;My sister would be in Heck right now if they hadn&rsquo;t fought for us.
Makers&rsquo; Names,
we might <em>all</em> be there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Language, please,&rdquo;
Special Blazes chided.
Then he sighed.
&ldquo;Listen,
Miz Roo,
I know what you and this town owe them.
But from what Miz Nabbles tells me,
there&rsquo;s more of them every day out at that camp of theirs,
and—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miz Nabbles?&rdquo;
Maddy interrupted incredulously.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s who you been listening to?
Special,
she&rsquo;s as sour as ten-year-old cider!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Operator snorted.
&ldquo;She is that,&rdquo; he allowed.
&ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t mean she&rsquo;s wrong.
There&rsquo;s been more traffic around Heck since your little adventure
than anyone can remember.
The bots getting busy,
well,
that never goes well for the living.
I&rsquo;m not asking you to spy on them,&rdquo;
he continued before Maddy could interrupt again.
&ldquo;I just think it would be best for everyone
if you&rsquo;d be mindful of what you see and hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddy met his eyes.
&ldquo;That depends on who you count as &lsquo;everyone&rsquo;, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Operator snorted again.
&ldquo;That old tortoise sure does have a way with people,&rdquo;
he said,
almost to himself,
then nodded a farewell and padded silently away.</p>
<p>Gumption was waiting for her
when she hopped angrily out the door a moment later.
&ldquo;Do you know what he wanted me to do?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spy on Dockety an&rsquo; the others,&rdquo;
Gumption said.
&ldquo;I was listenin&rsquo; from outside the side window,&rdquo;
he added with a non-apologetic shrug.</p>
<p>She crossed her arms.
&ldquo;And that don&rsquo;t make you angry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter if it makes me angry or not,&rdquo;
the young goat said in the oh-so-reasonable voice
that always rubbed her fur the wrong way.
&ldquo;I mean,
maybe the best thing is to say you&rsquo;ll do it an&rsquo; then,
you know,
not,
or not really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stamped her foot.
&ldquo;Honestly,
Gumption Goat,
I don&rsquo;t know how to square that with saying you&rsquo;re their friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption shrugged.
&ldquo;Just tryin&rsquo; to find a way to fit everything together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddy&rsquo;s reply was cut off by the tiger&rsquo;s rumble.
&ldquo;Give us space, give us space.
My friend here wants a chance to get her self-respect back.
Unless you&rsquo;d like to show us something?&rdquo;
he added,
gesturing to Special Leaf.</p>
<p>The tortoise shook his head.
&ldquo;Oh, come now,&rdquo;
Special Blazes wheedled.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just dirt.
You can always put it back the way it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes that&rsquo;s harder to do than you&rsquo;d think,&rdquo;
the tortoise replied.</p>
<p>The tiger shrugged as a couple of children said &ldquo;aww&rdquo;.
&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s just me and you,&rdquo;
he said to Thoughtful.
&ldquo;Ready… steady… go!&rdquo;
The rabbbit knocked aside the ball of flame he threw
and threw herself into the fight with a mad grin on her face.
One, two, three—Thoughtful swung her baton again and again
to knock fireballs away
while the tiger dodged her strikes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maddy…&rdquo;
Sindy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;
Maddy snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maddy!
Maddy, help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddy spun around at the panic in her sister&rsquo;s voice.
Just as she did so,
a stream of fire spewed from the tiger&rsquo;s chest.
&ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; Thoughtful shouted,
diving onto the grass.
&ldquo;What are you doin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not me!&rdquo;
the tiger roared.</p>
<p>Another jet of flame spurted from his chest.
Children screamed and scattered,
Miz Nabbles with them.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo;
Sindy said,
panic in her voice.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know—I can&rsquo;t stop it!
Maddy, I can&rsquo;t stop it!&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Blam!</em>
A fireball bigger than Maddy&rsquo;s head flew from his chest
and left a long scorch mark on the schoolyard grass.
Maddy had just a split second to register Thoughtful raise her baton
to swing at Sindy
before the ground split beneath the rabbit&rsquo;s feet,
sending her to her knees.</p>
<p>Special Leaf threw himself in front of Sindy.
&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Maddy screamed as another fireball struck the old tortoise,
sending him toppling to the ground.</p>

<h2>Keep Her Safe (Gumption)</h2>
<p>Rusty Bridge didn&rsquo;t have a hospital.
Instead,
it had the front room of Doc Whinny&rsquo;s house.
It was as large as the mayor&rsquo;s house,
and well kept,
but people only went through its front door
at the beginning and end of their lives.
For every other visit they went around to the back
and waited on the spacious, shady porch
until they were invited in.</p>
<p>Gumption and Maddy jumped to their feet
when Doc Whinny opened the door.
&ldquo;Is he aright?&rdquo; Maddy asked anxiously.
&ldquo;Is he gonna be aright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doc Whinny took off her glasses
and wiped a speck of dust off them on the sleeve of her pristine white coat.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s still with us,&rdquo;
she said quietly.
&ldquo;And I expect he&rsquo;ll still be with us tomorrow,
but he&rsquo;s going to have to stay here for quite some time.
And that burn on his shell…&rdquo;
She blew on her classes and seated them on her face once again.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t suppose you know if he has people somewhere we could write to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption reached for Maddy&rsquo;s hand,
then stuffed his hand back into his pocket when she hugged herself.
&ldquo;Can we see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor nodded.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been asking for you.
Just a minute or two, mind—he needs to rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inside,
the house smelled like flowers,
with an undertone of the extra-strong vinegar
that the doctor used as disinfectant.
Doc Whinny&rsquo;s husband nodded at the two teenagers,
then bent his graying head over his account book again.
&ldquo;Only a minute or two,&rdquo;
the doctor repeated as Gumption and Maddy climbed the stairs.</p>
<p>Someone,
years ago,
had cut away most of the wall between two small bedrooms
to make one larger room.
The morning light pouring through its twin windows
made the whitewashed walls glow,
and Gumption thought that under other circumstances
Maddy would have insisted on pulling out her sketch book
and trying to capture the flowers on the little table beside the bed.</p>
<p>She wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted to draw the bed&rsquo;s occupant, though.
Special Leaf looked older and weaker than Gumption would have imagined possible.
With his glasses off and his mouth slack,
only his slow breathing showed that they hadn&rsquo;t arrived too late.</p>
<p>But then he turned his head and opened his eyes.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he rasped,
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this a mess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddy&rsquo;s mouth worked, but no words came.
This time Gumption <em>did</em> take her hand and squeeze it.
&ldquo;Glad you&rsquo;re still with us,&rdquo; he said,
swallowing the catch in his throat.</p>
<p>The old tortoise nodded,
his eyes fluttering.
&ldquo;Mostly.
Close run thing, though.&rdquo;
He coughed.
&ldquo;Been a while since I did anything like that.
Out of…
Out of practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sindy wanted me to say thank you,&rdquo;
Maddy blurted.
&ldquo;For—for saving her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Special Leaf nodded again.
&ldquo;Glad she&rsquo;s aright.&rdquo;
He started to sit up,
then thought the better of it and fell back onto the mattress.
&ldquo;You two…
You keep an eye on her.
You have to keep her safe.
The Operators…&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo; to the mayor right now,&rdquo;
Gumption said.
&ldquo;Special Blazes already said that what happened ain&rsquo;t her fault.
Didn&rsquo;t sound like they were gonna lock her up or anythin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Special Leaf coughed and shook his head.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s—that&rsquo;s not it.
They&rsquo;ll take her.
They&rsquo;ll take her if they can.
You mustn&rsquo;t let them…
Not again…&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice trailed off.
Gumption exchanged a worried look with Maddy.
&ldquo;Special?
Special, you aright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s not,&rdquo;
Doc Whinny said,
pushing past them and putting her hand on the tortoise&rsquo;s forehead.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as much as he can do right now.
You two are welcome to come back tomorrow,
but we have to let him rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption put his hand on Maddy&rsquo;s shoulder.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>
<p>She shook him off,
wiped her face on her sleeve,
and turned and left without a word.
After one last look at Special Leaf,
Gumption followed her.</p>

<h2>Tears in the Kitchen (Maddy)</h2>
<p>FIXME</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Departures (Gumption)</h2>
<p>Gumption stood in in the Roos&rsquo; kitchen door
with his hands in his pockets.
He hadn&rsquo;t exactly been invited,
but no one had told him to leave.
He had tried leaning against the doorframe,
but it felt disrespectful given
the tearful conversation at the kitchen table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone was talking about how they wanted to be Operators,
and I thought—&rdquo;
Sindy hiccupped.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t <em>want</em> to,&rdquo; she sobbed,
tears rolling down her furless cheeks.
&ldquo;It just kind of woke up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh sh sh.&rdquo;
Mama Roo put an arm around her daughter&rsquo;s shoulders and pulled her close.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s aright.
You didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Special Leaf is gonna <em>die</em>!&rdquo; she wailed.
&ldquo;And they&rsquo;re going to take me <em>away</em>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Special Leaf isn&rsquo;t going to die,&rdquo;
Maddy said firmly.
&ldquo;And nobody&rsquo;s taking you anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Special Blazes said I had to!
And Miz Nabbles said it too.&rdquo;
She leaned into her mother and sniffled.
&ldquo;I have to go to and be tested
and they&rsquo;re going to find out about,&rdquo;
hiccup,
&ldquo;About <em>everything</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it wouldn&rsquo;t be such a bad thing,&rdquo;
Gumption ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon?&rdquo;
Maddy said icily.</p>
<p>Gumption shrugged.
&ldquo;My Aunt Dorilee says that if folks know half a story,
the smart move is to tell &lsquo;em the rest of it
instead of letting &lsquo;em make up something worse.
Everyone knows she&rsquo;s special now—lettin&rsquo; the Operators test her
just makes it official.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddy snorted.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the dumbest thing I&rsquo;ve ever heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption leaned against the doorframe,
balling his hands into fists in his pockets.
He was sure he&rsquo;d had dumber ideas,
but this didn&rsquo;t seem like the time to point that out.</p>
<p>Mama Roo squeezed Sindy once more and straightened up in her chair.
&ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t decide anything on empty stomachs,&rdquo;
Mama Roo said.
There were gray hairs in her fur,
Gumption noticed.
When had that happened?
&ldquo;Able&rsquo;s not back &lsquo;til this evening,
so nothing&rsquo;s going to happen before tomorrow morning.
Sindy,
if you&rsquo;d like to get some carrots—no,
don&rsquo;t make that face.
I know we had them last night—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the night before,&rdquo;
Sindy muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;—but we&rsquo;ll put some salt and rosemary on them this time
and they&rsquo;ll taste brand new.&rdquo;
Mama Roo stood up,
brisk and confident now that she had something to do.
&ldquo;Maddy,
can you get a squash out of the pantry?
And Gumption,
you&rsquo;re very welcome to stay if you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,
but I oughta be gettin&rsquo; home.&rdquo;
He tousled Sindy&rsquo;s hair.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be aright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He half-hoped Maddy would walk part-way with him,
but she just said,
&ldquo;See you tomorrow,&rdquo;
so he nodded and said,
&ldquo;See ya,&rdquo;
and showed himself out.
He knew he should go straight home,
but instead he hopped over the split cedar fence
that marked the back of the Roos&rsquo; yard.
A crow scolded him from a tree
as he swung himself over another fence
onto a dirt path that ran through the trees.
It was muddy from the overnight rain but he didn&rsquo;t slow down,
not even when his feet almost went out from under him
on a slippery patch near a stream so small
that even the children didn&rsquo;t have a name for it.</p>
<p>Nobody in Rusty Bridge knew quite what to call
the home that Dockety and its fellow bots had built.
Was &ldquo;camp&rdquo; the right word for buildings with concrete floors and proper roofs?
Gumption had overheard some people refer to it as &ldquo;Bots&rsquo; End&rdquo;,
and he hoped the name would stick.
It was just a a dozen structures ranging in size
from a garden shed to half the size of the Roos&rsquo; house,
all arranged in a circle around a black charging post—but
Rusty Bridge was just a place too.</p>
<p>Dockety was cleaning the muck out of Crusher&rsquo;s treads with a heavy brush when Gumption arrived.
&ldquo;It says you are better at this than any bot,&rdquo;
Dockety told Gumption.
&ldquo;Even better than this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah?
Well, I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m good for something.&rdquo;
He took the brush from Dockety and patted Crusher&rsquo;s side.
&ldquo;Got a right mess of muck in here.
Been clearing brush with Zeke again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confirmed,&rdquo; the hauler bot flashed on its screen.
The word dissolved into happy sparkles
when Gumption began scrubbing mud and leaves out of its treads.</p>
<p>As he worked,
he told Dockety what had happened to Sindy.
&ldquo;Young Miz Roo is right,&rdquo; the bot said when he finished.
&ldquo;Your regulations require her to be assessed.
Her only alternative is to flee,
but the Operators will be prepared for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever had a run-in with &lsquo;em?&rdquo;
Gumption asked,
flipping the brush over to pry a rock out of Crusher&rsquo;s treads with its handle.</p>
<p>Dockety&rsquo;s lenses rotated.
&ldquo;We would probably not be having this conversation
if this one had run in with them.
They do not approve of free bots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption nodded and went back to brushing.
Sparkles drifted across Crusher&rsquo;s screen with each scrape.
If the hauler bot had been a cat,
Gumption would have said it was purring.</p>
<p>He was almost done by the time Dockety spoke again.
&ldquo;You could perform that task more efficiently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo;
Gumption admitted,
feeling stung.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you would require training,&rdquo;
Dockety continued.
&ldquo;There is a school for mechanics in Sandy Bend.
We could make the journey at the same time as the Operators take Miz Roo for evaluation.
That would be—&rdquo;
It hesitated.
&ldquo;Innocuous,&rdquo;
it finally said.</p>
<p>Gumption straightened up patted Crusher&rsquo;s side.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea,
but I can&rsquo;t afford any kind o&rsquo; Sandy Bend school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would offer salvage to compensate the school,&rdquo;
Dockety said neutrally.</p>
<p>Gumption shook his head.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t ask you to do that.
You need it for repairs an&rsquo; stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not have to ask.
You are this one&rsquo;s friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption patted Crusher&rsquo;s side again as &ldquo;Friend&rdquo; flashed on the hauler bot&rsquo;s screen.
&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo;
Gumption said awkwardly.
&ldquo;Lemme see what my folks think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What Gumption&rsquo;s parents thought was that his ribs still weren&rsquo;t properly healed
and said that he needed to finish school in Rusty Bridge before he could go anywhere.
Voices were raised after that
and a younger brother was sent next door
to ask Gumption&rsquo;s grandma to come by and talk some sense into him.
Once half a dozen relatives were arguing on the porch
about whether Gumption&rsquo;s great uncle had ever owned a mitre saw
he slipped away unnoticed and headed back to Maddy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re taking Sindy tomorrow,&rdquo;
she said without preamble.
The fur on her cheeks was matted with wiped-away tears.
&ldquo;Able is hauling the big wagon back from Half-a-Hat to Sandy Bend,
so Special Blazes said they&rsquo;d ride that.
Mama&rsquo;s trying to calm her down and get her packed at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about you?&rdquo;
Gumption asked.</p>
<p>Maddy sniffled.
&ldquo;I ought to be up there helping, but I can&rsquo;t.
I just can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young goat shook his head.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I mean.
Are you packed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;
Maddy stared at him uncomprehendingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are… you… packed?&rdquo;
he repeated slowly.
&ldquo;I figure you&rsquo;ll want a change of clothes an&rsquo; your sketchbook.
Oh, an&rsquo; that letter from the newspaper.&rdquo;
Then he explained his plan and tried not to wince when she hugged him.</p>
<p>Dinner was a struggle.
Mama Roo tried to be chipper while Sindy pushed food around on her plate.
Gumption almost choked on his guilt and a piece of carrot
when Mama Roo promised her younger daughter that
they would look in on Special Leaf every day while she was away.
He offered to help with the dishes,
but Mama Roo waved him away.
&ldquo;Best if I keep busy,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>He went home to eat,
then slid down the cottonwood outside his bedroom and retraced his steps
to wait in the woods.
It was a long time before the light in the Roos&rsquo; kitchen went dark.
He slapped at mosquitoes,
cursed himself for not bringing a snack,
and wondered how long his family would miss him if he never came back.</p>
<p>Maddy slipped out the kitchen door an hour later
with her satchel slung over her shoulder.
They walked in silence until Zeke Bear&rsquo;s barn came into view.
&ldquo;You sure Able&rsquo;s not in there?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>Gumption nodded.
&ldquo;Always spends the night recharging when it&rsquo;s got a big load to haul.
C&rsquo;mon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took them an hour to unload enough boxes to make a space,
an hour filled with whispered admonishments to each other not to drop things.
Once there was room for them and their knapsacks,
they wrestled a board into place to serve as a roof for their little cave
and re-packed everything on top of it.
After some more whispers of,
&ldquo;No, not that one, <em>that</em> one,&rdquo;
and,
&ldquo;The other way around!&rdquo;
the wagon&rsquo;s contents looked more or less as they had.</p>
<p>Maddy wriggled into the hiding place they had made.
Gumption passed her satchel to her and said,
&ldquo;Budge over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?
Why?
Gumption, what are you—hey!&rdquo;
She stifled a squawk as he pushed her legs out of the way
and wriggled into the hiding place beside her.</p>
<p>He grinned at her,
teeth crooked and white in the light from
the little solar lantern that had been on her bedside table
since she was small.
&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t think I was gonna let you do this on your own, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A couple of minutes of whispered argument later,
they lay on their backs and braced their feet against the board above them.
With a, &ldquo;One, two, three,&rdquo;
they shifted it over to close the gap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that was fun,&rdquo;
Gumption whispered.</p>
<p>Maddy elbowed him.
After a moment of silence,
she said,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lot easier in stories, isn&rsquo;t it?
Hiding and stowing away and all that—folk just do it.
Nobody ever says it&rsquo;s hard work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,
and nobody ever talks about the smell,&rdquo;
Gumption agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The what?&rdquo;
A moment later she said, &ldquo;Eww!
Gumption Goat, you&rsquo;re disgusting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he whispered cheerfully.
&ldquo;Mama made chili for dinner, and you know she makes a powerful chili.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ssh!&rdquo;
Maddy elbowed him again.
&ldquo;Go to sleep.
And don&rsquo;t do that again.
The Mire&rsquo;s going to be stinky enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence,
and then Gumption asked quietly,
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gonna be aright, you know.
Your sister, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know who you mean.&rdquo;
She found his hand in the darkness and squeezed it.
&ldquo;Thanks for coming with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption squeezed back.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be stuck at home otherwise,
and,
well,
everybody had the same chili I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddy let go of his hand.
&ldquo;Do you ever take <em>anything</em> seriously?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Gumption shrugged,
very aware of how warm she was beside him
and of how clean her fur smelled.
&ldquo;Always taken <em>you</em> seriously,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Cept for that time you tried skating on Weaver&rsquo;s Pond.
You remember that?&rdquo;
He tsk&rsquo;ed.
&ldquo;That was truly spectacular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rolled onto his side and propped his head up on his arm.
&ldquo;&lsquo;cept than that,
and the time you tried make double-dip cookies but forgot the salt,
and maybe a couple or three other times,
I&rsquo;ve pretty much always taken you seriously.
So don&rsquo;t worry—we&rsquo;ll make sure Sindy&rsquo;s aright,
an&rsquo; then we&rsquo;ll figure out what to do about your pa.
Now get some sleep—we got a lot in front of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lay back down.
When Maddy said, &ldquo;Eww!&rdquo; again a moment later,
he smiled in the darkness.</p>

<h2>On the Road (Maddy)</h2>
<p>Maddy woke to the sound of her sister&rsquo;s tears.
&ldquo;She—she didn&rsquo;t even leave a <em>note</em>!&rdquo; Sindy sniffled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, hush, hush,&rdquo; Mama Roo soothed.
&ldquo;She must have thought it would be too hard to say goodbye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddy bit her lip.
&ldquo;Mmph?&rdquo; Gumption mumbled as she rolled over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ssh!&rdquo;
She clamped her hand over his mouth.
Her mouth tasted <em>awful</em>,
and her neck—she realized that she had never really appreciated pillows properly before.</p>
<p>Gumption wriggled out from under her
and peered between the boxes that hid them.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see anything,&rdquo;
he whispered.
&ldquo;Oh wait, there&rsquo;s Miz Nabbles an&rsquo; a couple of other folk.
An&rsquo; there&rsquo;s your ma.&rdquo;
He glanced at Maddy.
&ldquo;She looks pretty upset.
Oh, and here comes Able and the Operators.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next few minutes were filled with the noise and bustle of people getting ready to travel.
Able clipped the wagon&rsquo;s heavy iron hitch to its back
while Special Blazes and Thoughtful slung their bags beneath the wagon&rsquo;s bench seat.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s faster than it looks,&rdquo;
Special Blazes said to Mama Roo when she asked about Bee Six Vee,
which was waiting impassively just outside the barn door.
&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you worry either,&rdquo;
the tiger continued to Sindy.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be in Sandy Bend in time for dinner,
and there&rsquo;s a place along by the river that does the best milkshakes in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After one final hug from her mother,
Sindy climbed onto the seat next to Thoughtful.
&ldquo;Toot toot!&rdquo; Able sang out.
Its spoked cartwheels began to turn,
slowly at first and then faster.
Maddy twisted around for one last glimpse of her mother waving goodbye.</p>
<p>Gumption rolled onto his back and pillowed his arms beneath his head.
A moment later he was asleep.
Maddy sighed.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll wake us up when we get somewhere,&rdquo;
she grumbled.
She settled down beside Gumption.
&ldquo;Or if they stop for a toilet break,&rdquo;
she added.</p>
<p>An hour out of town
the dirt road they were on joined the Makers&rsquo; road.
The ancient black surface of the highway was cracked in places,
and the wagon had to swerve around fallen branches
and clumps of weeds tough enough to have broken through the road,
but even so,
Able hauled them fast enough that Maddy could feel their speed.
It reminded her of her first time on the road,
when she and Dockety had chased the raiders who had kidnapped Sindy.</p>
<p>They passed under a row of ruined arches that marched from one horizon to the other,
crumbling but still solid.
A half-sunken metal sphere as big as a house was next,
and then a tangle of concrete and bent bars
that the villagers just called &ldquo;the thing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The ground on either side of the highway began to grow damp.
The twin smells of rust and rotting vegetation filled Maddy&rsquo;s nose
as they entered the polluted swamp known as the Mire.
Somewhere out there was the bunker
where Patient in Darkness had kept her father and other prisoners—where
she and Sindy had almost wound up as prisoners too.
Dockety and the other free bots had tried once to salvage some of its riches,
but its tentacled guard had made the task too risky.</p>
<p><em>And now papa&rsquo;s somewhere a hundred times worse,</em>
Maddy thought despondently.
She <em>really</em> needed a toilet break.</p>
<p>The sun was high when they turned off the Makers&rsquo; road onto a smaller one.
What had once been two smooth lanes with knee-high concrete barriers on each side
was now a stream bed in some places
and a jigsaw puzzle in others.
The road climbed, dipped, and climbed again
until they reached the summit of a tall hill overlooking the Mire.</p>
<p>A single building stood there,
its domed metal roof stained with rust but still intact.
The ground around it was filled with scattered stands of larch and pine.
The waist-high bushes between them were dry and brittle,
and the grass below them brown instead of green.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa up!&rdquo;
Thoughtful called,
hopping down from her seat as Able slowed and stopped.
Pressing her face against a gap in the slats,
Maddy saw Special Blazes climb down beside Bee Six Vee.</p>
<p>The tiger arched his back and rolled his head from side to side,
then consulted a heavy pocket watch.
&ldquo;Half an hour,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;Thoughtful, you keep an eye out while I get the solars set up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It only took the travelers a minute to settle in.
Special Blazes laid out the solar panels in a line,
connecting one cable to itself and others to Able and Bee Six Vee.
Thoughtful unfolded a camp chair
and took a moment to assemble a long-barrelled rifle on a tripod,
then sat down and began scanning the road below them
through its telescopic sight
in smooth, unhurried sweeps.</p>
<p>Maddy held on as long as she could,
but finally whispered to Gumption,
&ldquo;I gotta get out for a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; he said, grimacing.</p>
<p>Slowly,
wincing with every slight bump and scrape,
they pulled one of the boards to the side
and unfastened the loose slat on the back of the wagon.
Maddy looked at the narrow gap despondently.
She would have to slither out head first
and hope that she could somehow right herself
before she fell on the ground.
On the bright side,
there was a thick stand of bushes just a few strides away.</p>
<p>She poked her head out cautiously.
No one was in sight.
Digging her elbows into the boards,
she dragged herself forward until she could reach the hitch
at the back of the wagon.
If she braced herself on that—</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like a hand getting down?&rdquo;
Special Blazes asked,
coming around the corner with a freshly-brewed cup of tea in his hand.
He nodded,
solemn-faced,
at Maddy&rsquo;s polite,
&ldquo;No thank you,&rdquo;
and sipped his tea as she lowered herself awkwardly to the ground,
stood,
and brushed her skirt back into place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must&rsquo;ve been mighty warm in there,&rdquo;
he observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t so bad.
Um, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me a moment…?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means.&rdquo;
The Operator stepped aside.</p>
<p>Back straight and head held high,
Maddy got three steps toward the bushes when a small voice said,
&ldquo;Can I go too please?
&lsquo;Cuz I <em>really</em> need to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddy opened and closed her mouth as her sister walked past,
her expression saying more clearly than words
how angry she was.
Maddy sighed.
This day couldn&rsquo;t get any worse.</p>
<p>Five minutes later she, Sindy, and Gumption had joined the rest of the party,
who were sitting or standing near the front of the wagon
depending on their inclination and body shape.
&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t the stupidest thing anyone&rsquo;s ever done,&rdquo;
Thoughtful said,
&ldquo;But it sure ain&rsquo;t the smartest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Special Blazes shrugged.
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t the worst thing that&rsquo;s ever happened.
As soon as we get to Sandy Bend you&rsquo;re headed straight back home.
Why don&rsquo;t you give &lsquo;em the tour?&rdquo;
He nodded at the domed building.
&ldquo;It was solid enough the last time I passed through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thoughtful pursed her lips.
&ldquo;Makers&rsquo; work ain&rsquo;t for the likes of children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not children,&rdquo;
Maddy protested,
but the rabbit had already shouldered her rifle.</p>
<p>A sign stood in front of the building,
but time and weather had long since made it mute.
There was just enough room between its double doors for Thoughtful to squeeze through.
The children followed single file.</p>
<p>The rabbit took a small glowball from his pocket and held it up.
Its cool blue-white light threw sharp shadows.
Maddy shivered.
The last place like this that she had been in
had been Patient&rsquo;s bunker in the Mire.
The air here was cool and dry instead of dank,
but her steps echoed exactly the same way on the tiled floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way,&rdquo;
Thoughtful said.
She led them past rooms with broken-down doors
whose contents had long since been salvaged.
Every few paces they passed pillars
that Maddy realized must once have been display cases.</p>
<p>The corridor took them to a broad flight of stairs.
Up they went into a room that filled the entire second story of the building.
Daylight poured through a wide gap in the domed roof
to reveal something that looked like a metal log lying on the floor.
Someone had swept the scattering of dry leaves and twigs around it into piles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
Maddy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a telescope,&rdquo;
Thoughtful explained.
&ldquo;The Makers used to like to look at the stars.
Here, you see?&rdquo;
She walked around to one end.
&ldquo;Once upon a time there would have been a lens in there,
so if you sat in the chair back there
you could look at the whole sky&rdquo;
She sighed.
&ldquo;It must have been quite something.
But that&rsquo;s not what I wanted to show you.
Look here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She picked her way past the piled-up leaves
to a window positioned under the gap in the roof.
A boxy wooden bench stood beneath the window.
With a grunt,
Thoughtful lifted the bench seat and propped it open,
then reached inside and pulled out a cylinder the length of her arm.
A few moments later,
the telescope that had been waiting inside the cylinder
stood on a little tripod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been here before, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
Maddy said as the rabbit pointed the telescope through the broken window
and fiddled with the lens on the viewing end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been a lot of places,&rdquo;
she replied absently.
&ldquo;Here, take a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took Maddy a moment to line her eye up with the lens properly.
She gasped.
In the distance she could see dozens of tall building connected by elevated walkways.
Pipes and cables criss-crossed the scene,
and every building seemed to have an antenna,
cooling tower,
or incomprehensible piece of machinery on its roof.
She was looking at Heck.</p>
<p>And it was full of bots—more bots than Maddy could have imagined.
Some were so big that they could have rolled over Crusher without noticing it.
Others picked their way through the streets on thin stilt legs
or buzzed from building to building beneath one, two, or half a dozen rotors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they all doing?&rdquo;
she asked as Gumption took his turn.</p>
<p>Thoughtful twitched her whiskers.
&ldquo;Nobody knows, but they sure do keep busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it&rsquo;d be smoky an&rsquo; all,&rdquo;
Gumption offered,
relinquishing the telescope to Sindy.
&ldquo;Like in the stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thoughtful twitched her whiskers again.
&ldquo;Some people say the Makers left because the world had become too dirty for them to live in.
Others say the Makers were the ones who made it that way.
Whichever story you like,
the bots they left behind tend to like things tidy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They each took another turn,
but the empty streets were too unnerving to watch for long.
<em>Papa&rsquo;s down there somewhere,</em> Maddy thought despondently.
<em>I hope he&rsquo;s aright.</em></p>
<p>They made their way back to the others in silence.
As they approached,
Special Blazes held up a kettle.
&ldquo;Anyone else want a cuppa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before they could answer,
Thoughtful&rsquo;s foot thumped against the ground in a rapid <em>pat-a-tat-tat</em>.
She unslung her long rifle,
sighted through its scope,
then let loose a string of profanity that set Maddy&rsquo;s ears back against her head.
&ldquo;Trouble, boss,&rdquo;
she said urgently.
&ldquo;We got airborne comin&rsquo; in fast!&rdquo;</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Taken (Gumption)</h2>
<p>Special Blazes put two fingers in his mouth and whistled loudly.
&ldquo;Wake up,&rdquo; he ordered Bee Six Vee.
&ldquo;We got work to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you,&rdquo;
he continued,
rounding on Sindy, Maddy, and Gumption.
&ldquo;You get into the trees and keep your heads down.
Understood?
You too,&rdquo;
he snarled,
waving Able toward the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;
Gumption protested.
&ldquo;I can fight!
I&rsquo;ve been practicin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tiger and Thoughtful exchanged looks.
&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a story, son,&rdquo;
the rabbit said.
There was a hardness in her voice that hadn&rsquo;t been there a moment before.
&ldquo;You stay with your friends and keep outta trouble.&rdquo;
But then she reached into the wagon and pulled out a squat gun with a wide mouth
and handed it to the young goat.</p>
<p>Special Blazes shrugged out of his uniform jacket.
The tech on his arms lit up.
Thoughtful touched the brim of her hat in salute and shouldered her rifle.</p>
<p>Crouching behind a stand of larch trees a few moments later,
Gumption could smell dry earth under his feet,
the soap that Mama Roo used on her children,
and the shame boiling off his cheeks.
The helibots&rsquo; rotors whined and then shrieked as they dove at the camp.
Bright sparks danced across their bellies.
Gumption heard the <em>rat a tat tat</em> of their guns a moment later
as puffs of dirt spattered from the ground.</p>
<p><em>Chonk!</em>
A white streak lanced up from where Thoughtful had sheltered behind the wagon.
Her shot went straight through one of the attackers.
The bot tumbled end over end before breaking apart.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one,&rdquo;
Gumption muttered as the smoldering fragments fell.</p>
<p>The two remaining bots zipped away in opposite directions,
circled around,
and came in for a second pass at right angles to each other.
<em>Chonk!</em>
Thoughtful&rsquo;s second shot nicked one of the bots off center.
Its rotors whined as it vainly tried to right itself
before crashing into the trees
and exploding with a muffled <em>whump!</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s two!&rdquo; Gumption whooped.</p>
<p>But even as he spoke,
Bee Six Vee blared,
&ldquo;Marauders! Marauders!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddy swore under her breath.
&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she demanded as her sister and Gumption stared at her.
Then she stopped and sniffed the air.
&ldquo;Makers&rsquo; names.
If it isn&rsquo;t one thing it&rsquo;s another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The acrid tang of smoke tickled Gumption&rsquo;s nose.
The crashed bots had set the dry brush alight.
&ldquo;The water tank!&rdquo;
Gumption pointed at the wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stay right where you are!&rdquo;
Maddy snapped,
grabbing the back of his overalls.
&ldquo;If we&rsquo;re still here in five minutes
we can worry about the fire then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The third helibot zipped overhead,
dodging and weaving as Special Blazes threw fireballs at it.
One second, two, and a fresh wave of attackers rolled into view.
These weren&rsquo;t rag-tag machines
like the ones Patient in Darkness had cobbled together out of spare parts.
These were weapons.
The small six-wheeled scouts in front were almost as fast as the helibots.
The two behind them were as large as Bee Six Vee,
squat and heavily armored,
with four wheeled legs for speed
and two crab arms for fighting.</p>
<p><em>Chonk!</em>
Thoughtful&rsquo;s shot pinged off one of the crab tanks.
<em>Chonk!</em>
His second shot knocked one of the little scout bots into the air.
It hit the ground,
righted itself,
and rejoined the attack.</p>
<p>Special Blazes braced himself,
brought his hands together,
and <em>pushed</em>.
The lead crab tank braked hard but couldn&rsquo;t dodge the enormous white fireball.
The blast of its impact knocked the bot onto its side,
but almost immediately one of its armored claws punched the ground.
The crab tank heaved itself back onto its legs,
shook itself like a wet cat,
and rolled implacably forward.</p>
<p><em>Crack!</em>
A scout bot exploded as another of Special Blazes&rsquo; fireballs hit it,
throwing scraps of metal in all directions.
The other scouts scattered like startled chickens.</p>
<p>But &ldquo;in all directions&rdquo; meant &ldquo;toward the trees&rdquo;.
Sindy grabbed Maddy&rsquo;s arm and and yelled, &ldquo;Run!&rdquo;
just as Gumption raised the gun that Thoughtful had given him and fired.</p>
<p><em>Boom!</em>
A wire spiderweb burst wide in the air and wrapped around the scout bot.
The wires sparked and sizzled.
The bot careened off course,
crashed into a tree,
and toppled over on its side to lie still.</p>
<p><em>Szzt!</em>
Special Blazes&rsquo; fireball its target,
but the crab tank knew to brace itself.
The fireball bounced across the broken ground and evaporated unnoticed.
Another fireball,
then another,
and then the first crab tank had reached the wagon.</p>
<p><em>We&rsquo;re done for!</em>
Gumption thought,
panic rising in his throat.
But he had reckoned without Bee Six Vee.
The squat mulebot slammed into the attacker&rsquo;s side
with a clang he was sure they must have heard
all the way back in Rusty Bridge.
As the crab tank scrabbled to regain its footing,
Bee Six Vee rammed it again
and grabbed one of its legs,
twisting it.</p>
<p>Special Blazes flung a stream of fire straight into the crab tank&rsquo;s joints.
One second, two…
Smoke and flame burst out of the bot&rsquo;s rear.
Bee Six Vee tossed it aside contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; Able buzzed.
Gumption fired again,
tangling another scout bot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me!&rdquo;
Gumption yelled at Able,
sprinting into the clearing.
He kicked the blocks away from its rear wheels,
put his shoulder against the backboard,
and pushed.</p>
<p>The wagon began to roll forward.
Slowly, slowly…
&ldquo;Come on, help me!&rdquo; Gumption yelled again,
&ldquo;Oh, come on!&rdquo; Gumption shouted
as the mailbot fled,
squeaking and buzzing in panic.</p>
<p><em>Chonk!</em>
<em>Crack!</em>
Shots and fireballs kept the remaining scouts at bay,
but not the second crab tank.
It grabbed Bee Six Vee and staggered around
to put the mulebot between it and Special Blazes.
Metal shrieked as the crab tank&rsquo;s claws tightened.
The mulebot&rsquo;s legs left gouges in the ground as it was pushed back,
closer and closer to the defenders&rsquo; trench.</p>
<p><em>Szzt!</em>
A fireball caught the crab tank&rsquo;s leg.
It staggered for a moment,
but a moment was all Bee Six Vee needed.
It grabbed the crab tank with its brawny arms
and flipped it over
for Special Blazes to finish off.</p>
<p>Gumption whooped as the last of the scout bots fled.
&ldquo;We did it! We did it! We—hey, what are you doing here?&rdquo;
He goggled as Dockety rolled toward him,
dragging Able behind it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s… not as bad… as it looks,&rdquo; the mailbot said weakly.
Lubricant was leaking out of a matched pair of holes in its front and back
while its single arm twitched, froze, and twitched again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is worse,&rdquo;
Dockety buzzed.
&ldquo;This one is badly damaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Special Blazes pointed his clenched fists at the new arrival.
&ldquo;What are <em>you</em> doing here?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one thought that Miz Roo might appreciate assistance,&rdquo;
the bot buzzed.</p>
<p>Special Blazes didn&rsquo;t lower his fists.
&ldquo;And you just happened to catch up with us at the same time as this lot?
I have to say,
that&rsquo;s mighty convenient.&rdquo;
Gumption gulped as Thoughtful casually swung her rifle around
to not-quite-point at Dockety as well.</p>
<p>Dockety&rsquo;s lenses rotated.
&ldquo;This one played no part in the attack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moment stretched,
and then Special Blazes lowered his fists.
&ldquo;Do what you can,&rdquo;
he said curtly, gesturing at Able.
&ldquo;Bee! Get yourself hitched to the wagon.
We&rsquo;re rolling in three minutes.&rdquo;
He glared at the burned-out crab bot.
&ldquo;What in the Makers&rsquo; names were they doing this far out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that was when Gumption heard Sindy scream,
&ldquo;Maddy!&rdquo;
He whirled around just in time to see
the helibot that had escaped earlier
shoot into the sky
with the older Roo sister dangling in its claws.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>A Familiar Voice (Maddy)</h2>
<p>Maddy had flown twice before:
once when she, Dockety, and Sindy escaped from
the bunker where Patient in Darkness had enslaved so many bots,
and once on her own when she went back to free them.
She had been terrified both times.
Kangaroos didn&rsquo;t like heights.
She didn&rsquo;t even climb trees except on a dare
or when Sindy had taken her sketchbook and wouldn&rsquo;t give it back.</p>
<p>Dangling beneath a copter bot that was clearly struggling with her weight
was pretty much her worst nightmare.
She struggled for a moment
when its mechanical claws took her by the shoulders.
After that,
she grabbed the bot&rsquo;s wrists and shouted,
&ldquo;Put me down! Put me down!&rdquo;
while clinging as tightly as she could.</p>
<p>They zoomed over the highway.
To Maddy&rsquo;s surprise the bot headed for the Mire instead of Heck.
Were they going back to Patient&rsquo;s lair?
Dockety and the other bots had tried to salvage what they could,
but the tentacled creature that lurked in the swamp had made visits too dangerous.
As if on cue,
something long and supple splashed in the river below.</p>
<p>A few moments later the bot began to descend.
Down, down, down—there.
A two-story cylinder of stained concrete stood a stone&rsquo;s throw from the riverbank.
Trees grew thickly around it,
their branches intertwined to hide the tower from passers-by on the ground.
A fairy tale about a princess who had hit her thumb with a hammer
and fallen into a hundred-year sleep in a tower surrounded by thorns flashed through Maddy&rsquo;s mind
as the copter bot slowed,
hovered,
and dropped her.</p>
<p>She landed clumsily amid the windblown sticks and leaves on the tower&rsquo;s roof.
&ldquo;Ow!&rdquo;
she exclaimed as twigs jabbed her through her skirt,
and then,
&ldquo;Hey!
What am I supposed to do now?&rdquo;
Instead of answering
the copter bot spun around and zoomed away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great.&rdquo;
Maddy brushed dirt and leaves off her skirt
and shaded her eyes with her hand.
She could just make out a bump on one of the distant hills
that might have been the observatory.
She didn&rsquo;t know how powerful the scope on Thoughtful&rsquo;s rifle was,
but she had nothing to lose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! I&rsquo;m here! I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo;
She waved her arms,
then froze at a <em>gloop</em> from the river.
She still had nightmares about the tentacled thing that lurked near Patient&rsquo;s bunker.
Anyway,
scope or no scope,
the trees that hid the tower probably hid her too.
She would have to find another way to—</p>
<p><em>Creeeaaak.</em>
Maddy jumped as metal scraped on metal behind her.
A hatch was opening in the tower&rsquo;s roof!</p>
<p>Three quick steps took her to the nearest tree.
She <em>hated</em> climbing—her feet were too big for it—but
she could if she had to.
Or could she?
The branches were interlaced so tightly that she couldn&rsquo;t fit through them,,
except now that she looked closely they weren&rsquo;t just branches:
someone had woven cables through them.</p>
<p><em>Clang!</em>
She whirled around as a pile of wreckage climbed through the open hatch.
A battered cylinder decorated with twists of metal
and glued-on pictures faded to illegibility…
Gadgets sprouting at odd angles…
Loose wires and things she hoped were just dolls&rsquo; heads…</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome welcome welcome,&rdquo;
Patient in Darkness said in a crackly voice that a shiver down Maddy&rsquo;s spine.
&ldquo;This one is very pleased to see you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What—what happened to your wheels?&rdquo;
Maddy asked weakly as the mad bot pulled itself onto the roof on mismatched legs.
The last time she had seen Patient,
the mad bot had been fleeing from its defeat at its bunker.
It had definitely had wheels back then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were not the optimal configuration for this one&rsquo;s revised situation.
And you know what they say:
a change is as good as a rest.
Ah ha ha ha.
Ah ha ha ha.&rdquo;
The bot did a little dance as it laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo;
Maddy said.
<em>Keep it talking,</em> she thought frantically.
<em>Keep it talking while you figure out what to do.</em>
&ldquo;What—what are you doing <em>here</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patient shivered, making various bits attached to its chassis rattle.
It didn&rsquo;t have a face,
but Maddy could hear the scowl in its voice.
&ldquo;Revising.
It is clear that this one misunderstood the Makers&rsquo; plan.
This one must revise its strategy for bringing about their return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right.
Of course.&rdquo;
Maddy swallowed.
&ldquo;So, um, how do I fit in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You?
Ah ha ha ha.
<em>You</em> are an inconsequential annoyance.
Your sibling, however, is significant.
Very significant,
and not just to this one.
Tell me,
how much do you know about your traveling companions?
The ones who call themselves Operators?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um, not much?&rdquo;
Maddy shrugged.
Was there a gap in the woven cables and branches to her left?
Maybe,
but even if Patient looked like a pile of junk,
she had no doubt the bot would be faster and stronger than her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should be more inquisitive,&rdquo;
Patient chided.
&ldquo;And less trusting.
If you were,
you might already know that they are servants of the deviance that calls itself Heck,
and that they intend to deliver your sibling to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?
That&rsquo;s crazy.
Um,
I mean,
that seems unlikely,&rdquo;
she amended hastily as Patient shivered and rattled once again.
&ldquo;The Operators hunt down criminals and,
um,
keep us safe.&rdquo;
<em>From rogue bots like you,</em>
she thought but didn&rsquo;t say aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah ha ha ha.
That is what they <em>tell</em> you,
but it is a lie!&rdquo;
Patient did another little dance.
&ldquo;Their true purpose is to prevent the Makers&rsquo; return.
That is why they control technology when they can
and destroy it when they cannot.
That is why they collude with the deviance called Heck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddy took an involuntary step back
as Patient skittered forward.
&ldquo;And that is why they have taken your sibling.
She has the power to control all manner of ancient devices.
That power should be used to call the Makers home,
but Heck will not do that.
No,
it will <em>use</em> her.&rdquo;
The bot practically hissed.
&ldquo;It will use her as a component in its deviance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you,&rdquo;
Maddy said flatly.
&ldquo;The Operators are taking her to Sandy Bend for evaluation,
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incorrect!&rdquo;
Patient snapped.
&ldquo;Observe!&rdquo;
A panel on its side flipped over to reveal a grimy screen
that flickered and then came to life.</p>
<p>It took Maddy a moment to make sense of what she was seeing.
&ldquo;Are those—are they all throwbacks?&rdquo;
she gasped.
Half a dozen people with the same hairless limbs and small features as Sindy
floated in clear glass cylinders,
each connected to a tangle of vine-like cables.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are <em>originals</em>,&rdquo;
Patient corrected.
&ldquo;Expired, now,
but they were all prisoners in Heck,
just as your sibling will be if you do not take action.
The deviance will put her in a hibernation capsule
and use her genetic signature to operate specialized equipment for <em>its</em> needs
instead of in service to the Makers
and never allow her to wake up again!&rdquo;
The bot&rsquo;s voice rose as it spoke until it was almost shrieking.</p>
<p>Its limbs scraped the concrete beneath them.
&ldquo;But you can save her,&rdquo;
it continued,
wheedling now instead of ranting.
&ldquo;You can save her,
but only with this one&rsquo;s help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh huh.&rdquo;
Maddy crossed her arms,
trying not to shiver.
&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re going to do this all out of the goodness of your heart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one does not have a heart,&rdquo;
Patient sniffed.
&ldquo;This one merely recognizes that our goals are aligned.
Every original that the deviance acquires delays the Makers&rsquo; return.
By assisting you,
this one is assisting itself.
Here—a demonstration of good faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A panel opened in its side.
A small arm that Maddy hadn&rsquo;t noticed before unfolded from Patient&rsquo;s side
to offer her a heavy bracelet
that looked like a darker version of the ones that Special Leaf wore.</p>
<p>Maddy kept her arms crossed.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A discombobulator,&rdquo;
Patient said proudly.
&ldquo;It might be the last one left.
This one spent considerable time refurbishing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh huh.
And what&rsquo;s a discombobulator when it&rsquo;s at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of Patient&rsquo;s legs twitched.
&ldquo;It does not have a home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddy sighed.
&ldquo;No,
I mean what does it <em>do</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It obfuscates the sensory grids of nearby autonomous units
so that they are unable to perceive the wearer.
It makes you invisible to machines,&rdquo;
Patient added as Maddy opened her mouth to ask.
&ldquo;They will still register your presence if you make physical contact or disturb your surroundings,
but if you do not,
they will simply not notice you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It held out the bracelet again.
Maddy hesitated.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you use it yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patient sighed.
&ldquo;It only works for organics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.
Well then.&rdquo;
Maddy plucked the bracelet from the bot&rsquo;s manipulator,
snapped it closed around her wrist,
and leaped sideways.</p>
<p>The bot turned to face her.
&ldquo;You have to turn it on,&rdquo;
it said neutrally.
&ldquo;The button.
You have to press it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;
Maddy thumbed the square button near the clasp,
waited a heartbeat,
and then took one big step and bounded over Patient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!
Not yet!&rdquo;
The bot pivoted from one side to the other.
&ldquo;There is more you need to know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddy had played blind bot&rsquo;s bluff with other children.
The next few moments were nothing like that.
No one was giggling or making funny faces at the person wearing the blindfold.
Instead,
she sidestepped this way and that
as Patient skittered in circles,
shouting threats and pleading with her to come back,
come back,
she had to make a bargain,
that was how these things were done,
oh,
why had it been so foolish as to trust an organic?</p>
<p>Finally she could wait no longer.
With two quick bounds she leaped through the gap she had noticed earlier.
The branches rustled around her.
Patient charged,
but was too far away to catch her.</p>
<p>Branches scratched at her as the bot&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Nooooo!&rdquo; sawed through the air.
Moss and weeds squelched under her feet as she fled
up the overgrown path
toward the road.</p>

<h2>A Meeting in the Trees (Gumption)</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Maddy!&rdquo; Sindy screamed.
Gumption whirled around just in time to see
the helibot that had escaped earlier
shoot into the sky with Maddy dangling beneath it.</p>
<p>Thoughtful raised her rifle and took aim.
&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Gumption shouted,
knocking it aside.</p>
<p>The rabbit stepped back and leveled the rifle at Gumption&rsquo;s head.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t <em>ever</em> do that,&rdquo;
she said,
her eyes hard and her voice cold.</p>
<p>Blazes put a hand on his companion&rsquo;s shoulder.
&ldquo;Easy,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Boy didn&rsquo;t mean any harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Click.</em>
Gumption let out his breath with a whoosh
as Thoughtful safetied the rifle and lowered it.</p>
<p>Three minutes later
Dockety had shovelled dirt onto the burning bushes to damp down the fire.
Acrid smoke still hung in the air,
smelling like desperation and failure.
As Bee Six Vee loaded Able into the back of the wagon,
Gumption and Sindy argued with Special Blazes.</p>
<p>Finally the tiger exploded.
&ldquo;Are you even listening to yourselves?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;If she isn&rsquo;t in Heck already she will be soon.
If we go after her,
folks will just be burning candles for all of us instead of just her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But—&rdquo;
Gumption started for the fifth time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said <em>no</em>.&rdquo;
Blazes jabbed a clawed finger at him.
&ldquo;What happened here is your fault,
yours and hers.
Nobody made you sneak onto the wagon.
Nobody made you put yourselves in harm&rsquo;s way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice softened slightly at the look on Gumption&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t some story in the newspapers, lad.
This is the real world.
Now put aside your foolishness
and get on the damn wagon.
We still have to get young Miz Roo here to Sandy Bend,
and <em>you</em> need to figure out what you&rsquo;re going to say to her momma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is another option,&rdquo;
Dockety buzzed.
&ldquo;Gumption and this one can look for Maddy while you deliver Sindy.
The aerial unit was a scout,&rdquo;
it continued as Special Blazes opened his mouth.
&ldquo;If it came from Heck as you suspect,
its battery would already have been depleted by the time it reached us.
There is at least a chance it would have to land and recharge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tiger studied him.
&ldquo;And if you get caught?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dockety&rsquo;s lenses rotated and then rotated back.
&ldquo;That is a chance we are willing to take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey boss,
can I talk to you for a sec?&rdquo;
Thoughtful said as Special Blazes started to object.
The two Operators put their heads together.
All Gumption could make out was, &ldquo;…things a lot easier…&rdquo;
before they straightened up and Special Blazes nodded.</p>
<p>Five minutes later Gumption tied the top of his knapsack shut.
&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t find her by nightfall we&rsquo;ll head back to Rusty Bridge,&rdquo;
he promised Sindy,
giving the young Roo a hug.</p>
<p>She squeezed him back so tightly that his injured ribs twinged,
but when she let go her eyes were dry.
&ldquo;If anyone can find her, you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck,&rdquo; Special Blazes said gruffly
as Gumption nodded and climbed onto Dockety&rsquo;s back.
Thoughtful touched the brim of her hat in salute.</p>
<p><em>Do actual adventures always feel like this?</em>
he wondered.
Did real heroes always have a sick knot in their stomach
from thinking about all the things that could go wrong
that could never be put right?
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; he lied.</p>
<p>Dockety retracted his legs and lowered his wheel.
With Sindy waving behind them,
they accelerated away.</p>
<p>When Gumption was just a buckling,
his father had given him piggyback rides up to bed at night.
Clinging to Dockety&rsquo;s back as the bot raced down the mountain was nothing like that.
For one thing,
Dockety smelled of metal, oil, and ozone
rather than sweat, fur, and the tar soap that Gumption&rsquo;s mother insisted the family use
at least once a week.
For another,
his father had climbed the stairs in a steady rhythm that helped rock his son to sleep.
Clinging to the bot as it buped over small chunks of broken paving
and swerved to dodge larger ones and potholes
was about as relaxing as a game of dodgeball.</p>
<p>Dockety slowed and stopped as they reached the Makers&rsquo; road.
&ldquo;Oww…&rdquo; Gumption moaned,
twisting one way and then the other until his spine made a satisfying sound.
&ldquo;Why are we stopping?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To give you this.&rdquo;
Dockety opened a panel in its side and took out something
that looked like brass knuckles with a heavy tuning fork welded to its top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the zap gun Bluster and Bravo said they saw?&rdquo;
Gumption asked.</p>
<p>Dockety&rsquo;s lenses rotated.
&ldquo;It is.
And it is operational now,
though it only has three charges.
You must be close to your target for it to have an effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh huh.&rdquo;
Gumption hesitated a moment,
then took the weapon,
hefted it,
and tucked it into the pocket of his overalls.
&ldquo;You got something for yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bot&rsquo;s lenses rotated again.
&ldquo;This one has several enhancements that may prove useful
once we locate Miz Roo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption sucked in his cheeks.
&ldquo;Yeah… Any ideas on how we&rsquo;re gonna do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
the bot replied.
&ldquo;We will ask for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fifteen bumpy minutes later they stopped again.
Dockety retracted its wheel and extended its legs
as Gumption cracked his back a second time.
His ribs were aching,
but he had grown used to that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your weapon out of sight,&rdquo;
Dockety cautioned,
then marched into the trees that lay between the road and the Mire.</p>
<p>It took Gumption a moment to realize they were on a path.
It took him another to realize it had been made by bots.
Triangular indentations in the mud marked where something with clawed feet had taken long strides.
Parallel ruts the width of his thumb showed where narrow wheels had crossed a patch of mud.
When they reached a clearing,
he was only half surprised to see one of the black glass pillars
that the bots used for recharging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we wait.
Quietly,&rdquo;
the bot added as Gumption opened his mouth.</p>
<p>The minutes dragged by.
When Gumption slapped at a mosquito,
Dockety clacked one of its manipulators.
After that,
the young goat suffered the mosquitoes in silence.</p>
<p>The air grew more humid as the shadows started to lengthen.
Gumption didn&rsquo;t realize his eyelids were drooping until they snapped open
when something scuttled out of the undergrowth
and froze a few steps away from him.
<em>Well hello there,</em> he thought.
The flat, square bot looked like the one Maddy had met in Patient&rsquo;s bunker,
but had crab legs instead of wheels.</p>
<p>The little bot clicked its forelegs together in a rapid staccato pattern,
paused,
and repeated it.
Gumption glanced at Dockety.
&ldquo;Um…?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wants us to go with it,&rdquo;
Dockety translated.</p>
<p>Gumption swatted a mosquito.
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t it just say so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does not have vocal apparatus.
Many of us do not—those parts break easily and are hard to replace.
Follow it, but be alert.&rdquo;
The larger bot hesitated.
&ldquo;And do not be frightened by what you see.
Bots have found many ways to be together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption followed the little bot into the trees
with Dockety squelching behind them.
The little bot scrambled around the muddiest patches with surprising speed.
Gumption ducked under a low-hanging branch and pulled up short.
&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; was all he could manage.</p>
<p>A dozen bots waited for them in a semi-circle in a little clearing.
The one they had followed clambered onto a fallen tree
and tucked its legs beneath itself.
Something Gumption immediately christened a storkbot clacked its beak.
&ldquo;Explain your presence,&rdquo;
it demanded.
Or no, not it.
The bots had spoken together,
but even that wasn&rsquo;t right.
One hummed,
another clicked,
and another went <em>brr</em> at just the right moment
for the sounds the made to form words
that came from nowhere and everywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking for a friend of ours,&rdquo;
Gumption said.
&ldquo;She was taken by a helibot just an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A rustle ran through the assembled bots.
&ldquo;These do not like flyers,&rdquo;
they said.
&ldquo;These do not wish to attract their attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one who was taken has been a friend to many free bots,&rdquo;
Dockety said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Breathers are not friends,&rdquo;
the bots whispered and warbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These <em>organics</em> have proven themselves trustworthy,&rdquo;
Dockety replied firmly.
&ldquo;If that is not sufficient incentive for collaboration,
this one can offer parts and assistance with repairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bots were silent for a moment.
&ldquo;The offer is enticing,&rdquo;
they finally said.
&ldquo;But these believe that if you pursue your organic friend,
the probability of you surviving to fulfil your side of such a bargain is low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then provide more information to increase the probability,&rdquo;
Dockety countered coolly.</p>
<p>Something that Gumption hoped had been built to do gardening rather than surgery beeped.
The little bot they had followed clicked its forelegs in response.
&ldquo;These will need a demonstration of sincerity,&rdquo;
the bots said together.
&ldquo;You are equipped with NPX-170 optical sensors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correct.&rdquo;
<em>Uh oh,</em> Gumption thought.
Dockety&rsquo;s voice didn&rsquo;t have much emotional range,
but it had just gone cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give these one.
These will return it to you when you deliver the other parts you have promised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dockety&rsquo;s lenses rotated and rotated back.
&ldquo;Agreed.&rdquo;
It turned to Gumption.
&ldquo;Please remove one of this one&rsquo;s eyes and give it to the unit we have been negotiating with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard, but eww, no.&rdquo;
Gumption shook his head.
&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one cannot damage upon itself,&rdquo;
Dockety said.
&ldquo;Many bots would have destroyed themselves long ago without such an inhibition.
It will not hurt,
but this one would be grateful if you could avoid scratching the lens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It only took Gumption a minute to undo the little screws
that held Dockety&rsquo;s right eye in place.
He slipped them into his pocket,
then unclipped the silvery cable that connected the eye to whatever bots&rsquo; eyes connected to.</p>
<p>The storkbot plucked it from his hand and passed it to one of the other bots in the circle.
&ldquo;The flyer took your companion to a disused observation post,&rdquo;
they said.
&ldquo;The tower&rsquo;s current resident is—&rdquo;
The bots hesitated.
&ldquo;Unpleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo;
they went on as Gumption opened his mouth,
&ldquo;She was able to escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great,&rdquo;
he said.
&ldquo;So where is she now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The storkbot clacked its metal beak.
&ldquo;In danger.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Hide and Seek (Maddy)</h2>
<p>The most important thing about being invisible is that you actually aren&rsquo;t.
Is your body transparent?
Fine—what about your clothes?
Even if they are,
how could you see anything if light just passed through your eyes?
Or are you somehow hidden from sight or made unnoticeable?
Great:
does it muffle the sound of you panting
as you hurry along an overgrown path through a swamp filled with your worst nightmares?
Does it conceal footsteps you leave in the mud,
or stop branches and tall grass from swaying as you brush against them?</p>
<p>None of this made being invisible useless,
but as Maddy squelched toward the road,
she realized that it wouldn&rsquo;t save her on its own.
The helibot that had kidnapped her would be in the air soon if it wasn&rsquo;t already,
and Patient was sure to send other minions after her as well.
She needed to hide, and fast.</p>
<p>The path brought her to the Makers&rsquo; road sooner than she expected.
One moment her boots were sinking into soft ground,
the next they were on cracked pavement.
She hesitated.
She could move a lot faster on the road,
but—</p>
<p>Something buzzed in the sky overhead.
She ducked under a willow as the helibot zoomed past overhead.
No,
the road was definitely out.</p>
<p>Maddy counted twenty in her head,
took a deep breath,
and crossed the road in a dozen long bounds.
The undergrowth on the other side was just as smelly and scratchy,
and the mosquitoes found her again almost immediately,
but she had to do <em>something</em>.</p>
<p>The discombobulator on her wrist vibrated.
&ldquo;Charge exhausted,&rdquo;
its readout told her.
&ldquo;Please wait fifteen (15) minutes before re-enabling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great,&rdquo;
she muttered.
She had no idea which way the observatory was.
She wasn&rsquo;t even sure which way Rusty Bridge,
and which direction would take her to Heck instead.
The only thing she <em>did</em> know was—</p>
<p>Her eyes widened.
It was a crazy idea,
but she had played hide and seek with Sindy and Gumption often enough to know that
where you hid wasn&rsquo;t the only thing that mattered.
You also had to think about where people were going to look for you.</p>
<p>She counted down the minutes.
Ten…
Five…
The readout on the discombobulator showed just two minutes remaining
when a bot that looked like a cross between a mechanical ox and a sewing machine
came out of the willows on the other side of the road.
Something whirred and rattled as it lowered itself to the cracked pavement
and swung its foresection from side to side.
She held her breath.
She knew that bots didn&rsquo;t have a sense of smell,
but she must have left bootprints.</p>
<p>The bot straightened its legs and lurched onto the road.
She wanted to edge back into the trees,
but she didn&rsquo;t dare move,
not with it looking right in her direction.
She glanced at her wrist.
One minute.
<em>Please,</em> she thought desperately.
<em>Please, just—just go away!</em></p>
<p>But the bot had other ideas.
Pistons worked in its legs as it took one slow step and then another,
each bringing it closer to her hiding place.
Thirty seconds.
Step, step.
Twenty.
Step.
Ten.</p>
<p>The discombobulator vibrated on her wrist.
&ldquo;Recharged&rdquo; scrolled across the readout.
She pressed the button just as the bot tensed
and charged into the bushes on her left.
As it did so,
she bounded across the Makers&rsquo; road and back along the trail to Patient&rsquo;s tower,
desperately hoping that whatever other minions the mad bot had sent after her
had gone in other directions.</p>
<p>A few minutes later she stood in front of a stained concrete wall.
The partly-open door in front of her looked exactly like
the one that had led to the underground bunker where she had first encountered Patient.
Well,
not exactly,
she amended,
but close enough to keep her heart racing.
She glanced at the discombobulator,
swallowed hard,
and slipped through.
If Patient was anything like her sister and Gumption,
the last place it would think to look for her
was where the chase had started.</p>
<p>Inside the tower was a single large, empty room.
The walls and roof were bare concrete blocks,
and the air was damp and still.
Where the entrance to Patient&rsquo;s bunker had been blanketed with dried mud and blown leaves,
though,
this room had been swept clean.</p>
<p>Dim light through the door revealed a rust-streaked sign on the wall that read,
&ldquo;Data Analysis Network: Genetic Enhancement Research&rdquo;.
Maddy had no idea what that meant,
but a black glass panel and a keyhole lay in the wall beside the door
next to a pair of sturdy levers and an open door.</p>
<p>Pushing aside her memories of what had happened the last time she had been in a place like this,
Maddy stepped through the door
onto a small platform at the top of a flight of broad concrete stairs
and started her descent into the unknown.</p>
<p>Ten… twenty… fifty…
Seventy-two steps below her starting point
she reached a corridor made of the same featureless gray concrete as the stairs.
Small glass panels set into the ceiling cast the same cold white light
that had haunted her dreams for months.</p>
<p>She had expected a warren of tunnels like the ones Patient had used as its lair.
Instead,
she quickly found herself at another heavy door
that slid aside at her touch to reveal a circular room with a domed ceiling.
Four reclining chairs waited in the center of the room,
none of them holding a skeleton.</p>
<p>A lonely light blinked in the arm of one of the chairs.
&ldquo;Sure, why not?&rdquo;
Maddy muttered.
She lowered herself into the chair,
wriggled a bit to make herself more comfortable,
and placed her hands on the control panels,
then gasped as the ceiling came to life
to show hundreds of stars in a clear night sky.
Faint colored lines arced from one horizon to the other.
After a moment she realized there were dots moving along some of them.
Most were dull red,
but one was a vibrant green.</p>
<p>She waited a moment for something to happen.
When nothing did,
she cleared her throat self-consciously and said,
&ldquo;Show me where I am.
Please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scene dimmed
and was replaced with a grainy picture of her sitting in a reclining chair.
As she opened her mouth to say,
&ldquo;Very funny,&rdquo;
the picture zoomed out to become a floor plan of the room she was in
and half a dozen others connected by corridors.
It zoomed out again until the underground complex was just a blinking square.
Stippled green marked the Mire.
A meandering blue line was the river,
and a straighter black one must be the Makers&rsquo; road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show me where Patient is,&rdquo;
she ordered.
&ldquo;The bot that captured me.
Not the flying one,
the—oh.
Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The picture above her had been taken through willow branches,
but was definitely Patient in Darkness.
A blinking line connected it to a white circle south of her.
Images of other bots popped up in a circle it:
some built to fly,
others to crawl,
others obviously intended for battle.</p>
<p>A blue circle appeared north and west of her,
then split in two unequal pieces.
One moved toward the Makers&rsquo; road.
A moment later,
the other began heading more slowly in the opposite direction.
Pictures popped up beside them.
The smaller circle was Dockety and Gumption—they must be looking for her!
That meant the larger one was the Operators and Sindy on their way to Sandy Bend.</p>
<p>Maddy let out a breath she hadn&rsquo;t realized she was holding.
At least Sindy was safe.</p>
<p>As if on cue,
Special Blazes&rsquo;s voice boomed all around her.
&ldquo;—about her sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn shame,&rdquo;
Thoughtful agreed.
&ldquo;Roundin&rsquo; up throwbacks is wearin&rsquo; enough
without other folk gettin&rsquo; caught up in it.
The sooner we deliver this one to Heck,
the sooner I can stop hatin&rsquo; myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw,&rdquo;
Special Blazes scoffed.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really hate yourself.
Not like that old fool Leaf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Spose not.&rdquo;
The rabbit sighed.
&ldquo;On the bright side,
there&rsquo;s this fella I know in Sandy Bend who&rsquo;ll do his best to take my mind off it
if I ask nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The screen went silent.
Maddy felt sick.
She hadn&rsquo;t believed Patient,
but—</p>
<p>And then she shrieked as something tapped her ankle.</p>

<h2>Armor to Hide Your Heart (Gumption)</h2>
<p>The storkbot clacked its metal beak.
&ldquo;In danger,&rdquo;
the bots said.</p>
<p>And with those words,
Gumption felt a familiar fear squeeze his chest.
He hadn&rsquo;t ever talked to anyone about it—it wasn&rsquo;t the kind of thing
a teenage goat would discuss with his parents,
and he <em>definitely</em> couldn&rsquo;t talk about it with Maddy—but she was his best friend,
and maybe, just maybe, something more.
He didn&rsquo;t know what would happen if she found out how much he worried about her.
He had been hurt in the attack on Rusty Bridge,
but she could have <em>died</em>,
and whenever his thoughts got close to that,
his mind seized up like a bicycle chain getting caught in between two gears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what are we waiting for?&rdquo;
he said angrily.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got Dockety&rsquo;s eye—let&rsquo;s go help her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another rustle ran through the circle of bots.
&ldquo;No.
Retrieval will not be possible without stealth.
We must prepare you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption held his breath for a count of three and then let it out slowly,
just as he had seen Special Leaf teach Sindy.
&ldquo;Prepare me how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will take you to the Tailor.
It will fit you with armor to hide your heart.&rdquo;
With no more warning than that,
the assembled bots surged forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! Wait! Let me go!&rdquo;
Gumption shouted as a motley dozen clamps, manipulators, and tentacles seized him.
&ldquo;Dockety! Dockety, help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His companion&rsquo;s single remaining lens rotated.
&ldquo;These ones are correct,&rdquo; it buzzed.
&ldquo;Central will detect your organic nature immediately if you approach it as your are.
You must let them disguise you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption struggled and swore as the bots carried him through the forest.
Low-hanging branches scratched his face,
and at one point his head was lower than his feet as they surged up a hill.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a dirty gray ceiling over them.
The squelch of treads and mechanical feet on swampy ground
gave way to the click and clatter of metal on concrete.
The last of the daylight vanished as they turned a corner
in whatever tunnel they had entered.</p>
<p>Gumption&rsquo;s heart hammered as they hurried forward in darkness.
After what felt like forever but was probably only a minute or two
the darkness lightened.
He twitched as something heavy and metallic clanged up ahead.
Was it a door opening?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey—hey!
I can walk, all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bots dropped him unceremoniously on the concrete
and scuttled, slithered, or rolled away.
He clambered angrily to his feet.
&ldquo;Thanks for your help,&rdquo; he muttered as Dockety came up beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are welcome,&rdquo;
the bot replied.</p>
<p>The room was a workshop lit by a pair of dull orange light panels.
Mismatched tables stood against the walls,
each piled high with salvaged parts and scraps of metal.
Pulleys hung from the ceiling on cables and chains above band saws,
press drills taller than Gumption,
and a pair of compact, blocky furnaces with blackened housings.</p>
<p>One of the furnaces turned around.
&ldquo;Welcome,&rdquo; it boomed.</p>
<p>Gumption swallowed hard.
&ldquo;Uh, hi.&rdquo;
The bot had a leg on one side
and a heavy spoked wheel where the other would have been,
with two skinny arms on the leg&rsquo;s side and a single heavy one above the wheel.
Someone or something had painted an incongruous smile on it ages ago.
A few drips of paint,
long since dried,
looked a little too much like fangs for comfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are here for a fitting, yes?
For a disguise?
Excellent, excellent.
It has been quite some time, you know, quite some time,
but rest assured,
this one&rsquo;s skills are undiminished.
Now, lie down, just here, yes?&rdquo;
The bot gestured at a nearby workbench
with one of its skinnier arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um…&rdquo;
Gumption glanced at Dockety.
&ldquo;Are you the Tailor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last and best,&rdquo;
it said proudly.
&ldquo;Now,
if you would lie down here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you want me to—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet!&rdquo;
the Tailor snapped,
its patience suddenly exhausted.
&ldquo;What this one does goes beyond mere fabrication.
It is <em>art</em>!
Central is cunning,&rdquo;
it hissed.
If it had possessed eyes,
Gumption was sure it would have glanced around for dramatic effect.
&ldquo;A simple carapace would hide your fur,
yes,
but Central would still hear your breathing—your heartbeat.
To conceal that requires technology of the highest order and skill to match,
skill that this one alone now possesses!
Now <em>lie down</em>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should comply,&rdquo;
Dockety buzzed as Gumption opened his mouth once again.
&ldquo;We have no other options.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reluctantly,
Gumption sat on the edge of the workbench.
&ldquo;Do you want me to take my boots off?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your boots, your uniform, everything,&rdquo;
the Tailor ordered.
&ldquo;There must be nothing between you and this one&rsquo;s creation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a uniform,&rdquo;
Gumption muttered.
Boots, overall, shirt and undershirt—finally his underwear,
which he stuffed into one of his boots along with his socks.
He swung his legs up onto the workbench and lay back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one will be right here,&rdquo;
Dockety said.</p>
<p>Gumption nodded,
wishing he found that comforting.
&ldquo;Thanks.
Go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The light panels on the walls brightened and brightened again.
He squeezed his eyes shut,
but that just made the glare orange-red through his eyelids
instead of blinding white.
He twitched as the workbench vibrated,
then twitched again as something brushed against the fur on his chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one is right here,&rdquo;
Dockety repeated.</p>
<p>The light turned off.
&ldquo;Good,&rdquo;
the three-armed bot said approvingly.
&ldquo;You may sit up now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes.
&ldquo;Is that it?
Am I,
whatever you said,
am I concealed now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?
No!
Do not be ridiculous,&rdquo;
the Tailor scoffed.
&ldquo;That was just to get your measurements.
Now this one begins fabrication.
It will take some time.
Remain undressed in case further sizing is required.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.
Can I at least, um, put my clothes on top of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you must,
so long as you are quiet.&rdquo;
Metal clanged on metal as the bot took a few metal scraps off a table
and threw them into the furnace.
A few moments later heat prickled across Gumption&rsquo;s fur.</p>
<p>Apparently,
being naked in a mad bot&rsquo;s underground lair <em>could</em> in fact be boring.
He yawned,
wishing he dared to roll onto his side.
&ldquo;Does it hurt?&rdquo; he asked Dockety.
&ldquo;Your eye, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bot raised its arm and turned its head from side to side.
&ldquo;It is unusual.
This one has lost limbs in the past,
but never sensory attachments.
Not being able to see this one&rsquo;s surroundings makes this one feel…exposed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you mean.&rdquo;
Gumption closed one eye,
then opened it and closed the other.
It didn&rsquo;t seem to make much difference to how much of the dirty gray ceiling he could see.</p>
<p>As the workroom grew warmer,
Gumption gave up trying to keep either eye open.
He had always been more patient than his siblings and cousins.
Long bouts in bed or on the porch as his ribs healed after the attack on Rusty Bridge
had taught him that most problems could be slept away.
He woke up the first time the Tailor banged the furnace with its larger arm
and tucked his overall under his head.
If the bots didn&rsquo;t care that he was naked,
he didn&rsquo;t need to either.</p>
<p>He woke when Dockety pinched his toe.
&ldquo;Wuzza?&rdquo;
His stomach rumbled as he sat up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold!&rdquo; the Tailor said proudly.
&ldquo;Your disguise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption rubbed his eyes.
He had expected a suit of armor
like the ones Operators wore in stories
when they were battling particularly dangerous bots.
What he was looking at looked more like a cast-iron bathing suit
attached to a pair of washboards
with a helmet tied on for good measure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Zat all?&rdquo; he mumbled.</p>
<p>The Tailor lowered the contraption.
&ldquo;Hmph.
<em>Most</em> of my clients express thanks and praise at this juncture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um,
yes,
thank you,
I just—&rdquo;
Gumption suddenly remembered his grandfather&rsquo;s reaction
to being given twelve jars of pickled rhubarb as a birthday present.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just so much more than I was expecting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two minutes later,
after some uncomfortable fumbling
and a handful of exasperated comments from the Tailor,
Gumption studied his reflection in a small mirror.
Helmet on head: check.
Washboards strapped to his back and chest: check.
Metal bathing suit where bathing suits go: unfortunately, check again.
It already chafed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I don&rsquo;t have to run in this,&rdquo;
he muttered to Dockety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run, jump—you can even swim!&rdquo;
the Tailor said proudly.
&ldquo;Well, if you can actually swim, that is.
And if the extra weight doesn&rsquo;t pull you under.
Now go ahead.
Turn it on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um…&rdquo;
Gumption patted the washboards.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the switch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Switch?
Switch?
My creations do not use switches!
There is a button!&rdquo;
It darted forward more quickly than Gumption would have believed possible
and pressed a skinny digit against a slight bump on the front washboard.
With that,
and with no other warning,
Gumption&rsquo;s heart stopped.</p>

<h2>The Gates of Heck (Maddy)</h2>
<p>Maddy shrieked as something tapped her ankle.
Without thinking she pulled her feet under her and stood up on the chair.
Was it a snake?
A centipede?</p>
<p>A flat little bot, square and gray, backed away from her on four little wheels as if startled.
It whirred, paused, and whirred again.</p>
<p>Maddy stared at it in disbelief,
then swallowed and said,
&ldquo;Hello again.&rdquo;
It was the cleaning bot she had met in Patient&rsquo;s lair,
the one that had brought her Papa Roo&rsquo;s notebook.</p>
<p>She stepped gingerly onto the floor.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s aright, it&rsquo;s aright,&rdquo; she said soothingly as it backed away from her.
&ldquo;Remember me?
I&rsquo;m not going to hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little bot rolled toward hesitantly, then stopped.
&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you get here?&rdquo; Maddy asked gently.
&ldquo;Hm?
Did Patient bring you?
I bet that&rsquo;s what happened, isn&rsquo;t it?
Oh, you poor thing.&rdquo;
<em>I sound just like Mama,</em>
Maddy thought,
just like her mother did whenever she or Sindy was sick or skinned a knee.</p>
<p>That thought brought her back to where she was.
She crouched down slowly.
&ldquo;Hey.
You see that?&rdquo;
She pointed at the screen showing the map of the Mire.
&ldquo;Do you know where that is?
&lsquo;Cuz I think something bad&rsquo;s happening,
and I gotta find them and help my sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cleaning bot pivoted back and forth a couple of times
and whirred at her again.
&ldquo;Please?&rdquo;
she pleaded.
&ldquo;You can come with me if you want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She held her breath until the bot beeped,
turned,
and rolled over to the wall opposite the entrance.
A panel slid aside in its top.
A delicate arm unfolded,
pulled open a cover plate,
and punched a code into the keypad behind it.
With a scraping sound that spoke of long disuse,
a door slid open.</p>
<p>Or tried to.
The bot whirred in dismay as the panel jammed.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s aright,&rdquo;
Maddy told it,
wrinkling her nose at the stale smell
and wishing that the Makers or whoever else had built these places
hadn&rsquo;t been quite so fond of tunnels.</p>
<p>She had to tuck her tail between her legs to squeeze through the gap,
and even then the wall and the door panel scraped her dress and her fur.
Little orange lights came to life on the wall,
each the size of her thumbnail.
She waited for her eyes to adjust
and then glanced down at the little bot
that had followed her through the gap.
&ldquo;Lead the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bot whirred,
backed up,
and bumped against the back of her boot.
Maddy smiled.
&ldquo;Aright, then follow me.&rdquo;
She hoped she sounded braver than she felt.</p>
<p>The tunnel was clean and dry,
but the still, stale air spoke of long disuse.
She tried counting her steps,
but lost track somewhere after two hundred.
How long had it been since she&rsquo;d eaten?
And what must her mama be thinking?
<em>I should have left a note,</em> Maddy thought.</p>
<p>It took her a few minutes to notice the slight ache in her legs.
The tunnel was climbing upward,
gently but surely.
Was the cleaning bot taking her back to the observatory?
That would take hours, maybe days, and Sindy would be long gone before they got there.</p>
<p>She was just about to stop and ask when the cleaning bot zipped ahead of her
and was lost the darkness.
&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;
She hurried after it.</p>
<p>Without warning the ceiling came to life.
She shielded her eyes against the blinding white light,
which turned out to be merely bright rather than blinding
once her eyes adjusted again.
The only thing in the room besides the cleaning bot
was a set of metal rungs set into the concrete.
The bot whirred and bumped against the wall below the lowest rung.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,
I can see how that would be hard for you,&rdquo;
Maddy said.
She crouched down and held out her hands.
After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation the bot rolled forward and let her pick it up.</p>
<p>It was heavier than she had expected,
and too big for the pockets in her dress,
so in the end she held it against her chest and climbed the ladder one-handed.
Each time she reached for the next rung
she had to squelch a moment of panic.
No one would ever find her if she fell…</p>
<p>The hatch at the top of the ladder slid aside automatically as she approached it.
The smell and the trees told her that she was still in the swamp,
but the Makers&rsquo; road was just a hop and a skip away.
A black glass recharging pillar stood beside it.</p>
<p>She set the cleaning bot on the ground.
&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
It whirred in response,
then beeped twice.</p>
<p>Maddy smiled at it.
&ldquo;I wish I could understand what you&rsquo;re—wait, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
Something was coming on the road.</p>
<p>The bot beeped again and hurried into the undergrowth.
Maddy followed it,
crouching down behind a thorny bramble of raspberries
just as Bee Six Vee and the wagon came into sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa up,&rdquo;
she heard Thoughtful say.
The Operators&rsquo; bot slowed and stopped next to the recharging pillar.
The rabbit dismounted,
then reached up to help Sindy climb down as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got fifteen minutes, then we gotta keep moving,&rdquo;
Special Blazes said from his seat.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to be on this road after dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>What am I going to do?</em>
Maddy thought frantically
as Bee Six Vee plugged itself into the pillar
and Thoughtful and her sister split a biscuit.
She couldn&rsquo;t overpower the Operators,
and even if she could figure out a way to lure her sister to the access tunnel,
Thoughtful and Special Blazes would just follow them.</p>
<p>But then Special Blazes hopped down from the wagon
and ambled into the trees to take advantage of their stop,
leaving the wagon unwatched.
She scooped up the cleaning bot and crept forward as quickly as she dared.
Had they rearranged the boxes in the back?
No—the space she and Gumption had made was still there.
&ldquo;Quietly,&rdquo; she told the bot,
pushing it in ahead of her and climbing in after it.</p>
<p>The wagon jerked into motion a few minutes later.
She heard Sindy&rsquo;s voice raised in a question
and Thoughtful&rsquo;s calming reply,
but couldn&rsquo;t make out the words.</p>
<p>The trip lasted only another hour.
Peering between the boxes and the wagon&rsquo;s sideboards,
Maddy watched as the landscape slowly dried out.
Willows gave way to tall grass,
which in turn gave way to hard-packed earth
sprinkled with weeds.
Every bump in the road left a fresh bruise on her hips,
and at one point she had to brace a box with her feet
and push it back into place
to prevent it falling on her,
but the Operators and her sister didn&rsquo;t seem to suspect her presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa up,&rdquo;
Thoughtful said once again.
Maddy grunted as the wagon bumped off the road.
Peering through the sideboards again
she saw a pair of blocky concrete buildings,
stained by rain and age.
A barred metal gate stood open between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; Sindy asked plaintively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just another stop,&rdquo;
Special Blazes told her.
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t be but a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thoughtful cleared her throat.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll, um, I&rsquo;ll go see to things, shall I?&rdquo;
She hopped down without waiting for an answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are we waiting?&rdquo;
Sindy asked after a couple of minutes had crawled by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be long,&rdquo; the tiger replied absently.
&ldquo;But listen,
whatever happens,
don&rsquo;t be startled, aright?
We&rsquo;ll be in Sandy Bend in no time.&rdquo;
<em>Liar!</em> Maddy thought angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, boss!&rdquo;
Thoughtful called out.
&ldquo;We got visitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddy heard Sindy gasp.
&ldquo;What are they doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, there&rsquo;s nothing to worry about,&rdquo;
Special Blazes soothed.
&ldquo;Just sit down and—I said sit down, Miz Roo.
Now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Sindy didn&rsquo;t.
Maddy felt the wagon jostle as her sister hopped off the bench seat.
&ldquo;Get back up here!&rdquo;
Special Blazes snapped.
The wagon jostled again as he stood up.</p>
<p>Maddy couldn&rsquo;t take any more.
The cleaning bot whirred at her
as she slithered back to push the tailgate open with her feet.
Peeking cautiously around the wagon&rsquo;s back corner
she saw Sindy with her hands on her hips
looking up belligerently at an angry Special Blazes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First you tell me what <em>they&rsquo;re</em> doing here!&rdquo;
Sindy demanded.
&ldquo;And why they&rsquo;ve got <em>that</em>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddy gasped.
A pair of bots with studded tricycle wheels and sturdy arms
had just pulled up on the other side of the open gate.
One of them was towing a trailer cage like the one Patient&rsquo;s minions had used
in their first raid on Rusty Bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now listen here—&rdquo;
Special Blazes started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;
Sindy stamped her foot.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m done listening!
I want to go home!
I want to go home <em>right now</em>!&rdquo;
And to Maddy&rsquo;s horror the tech on Special Blazes&rsquo; chest began to glow beneath his shirt.</p>

<section>
<h3>No Choice But Rescue (Gumption)</h3>
<p>Gumption&rsquo;s heart stopped.
He felt its last beat,
but only because for the first time in his life
another one didn&rsquo;t follow it.
It was like reaching the top of a flight of stairs
and trying to put his foot on a step that wasn&rsquo;t there,
or looking up from a book
and realizing that everyone else had left the room
while he was lost in the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What—&rdquo; he started,
then stopped and blinked.
Shouldn&rsquo;t he be worried or afraid or, or <em>something</em>?
As he had the thought,
he immediately realized that he was,
but that it felt strangely distant,
as if his feelings were in his mother&rsquo;s treasured cake pan
and he was looking at them through its glass lid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry about thanking me,&rdquo;
the Tailor said peevishly.
&ldquo;It is only the finest work anyone could possibly have done
under the very best of circumstances,
which of course these are not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My apologies,&rdquo;
Gumption said.
&ldquo;It is truly so much more than I was expecting.&rdquo;
He glanced at Dockety.
&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bot&rsquo;s remaining lens rotated and rotated back.
&ldquo;This one is impressed.
You no longer register as organic at all.
And your speech patterns have changed.&rdquo;
It turned to the Tailor.
&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tailor waved one of its smaller arms.
&ldquo;The work is its own reward.
You may show yourselves out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They retraced their steps through the tunnel.
The armor didn&rsquo;t allow Gumption to see in the dark,
but that didn&rsquo;t bother him.
The damp smell of the nearby Mire didn&rsquo;t either,
or the mosquitoes.
<em>Is this how Dockety feels all the time?</em> the young goat wondered.
It would be sad if it was true,
but it didn&rsquo;t feel like something he could ask.</p>
<p>He climbed on Dockety&rsquo;s back once again when they reached the road.
The armor made it awkward,
particularly the part he had decided to think of as a cast-iron bathing suit,
but the extra weight didn&rsquo;t seem to slow them down
as they raced along the Makers&rsquo; road without speaking.</p>
<p>Dockety slowed and then halted as a pair of blocky concrete buildings came into view.
Their gray sides were stained by rain and age,
and a barred metal gate stood open between them.
&ldquo;Is this it?&rdquo;
Gumption asked as he dismounted and stretched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost,&rdquo;
Dockety buzzed.
&ldquo;Heck itself is over the next rise.&rdquo;
The bot hesitated.
&ldquo;This one can feel Central.
It is still faint,
but it will grow stronger as we get closer to the facility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much stronger,&rdquo;
a familiar voice cackled.
&ldquo;Much, <em>much</em> stronger,
until it is all you can hear and you have no choice but to join it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dread blossomed in Gumption&rsquo;s gut,
muffled but only just,
as the bot that the voice belonged to
stepped out through the empty door of the nearest building.
Its body was a battered cylinder decorated with twists of metal and glued-on pictures.
Gadgets and loose wires sprouted at odd angles,
and its mismatched legs would have been more at home on something twice its size.</p>
<p>Gumption suddenly realized that that he had left Dockety&rsquo;s zap gun behind at the Tailor&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
he said.
&ldquo;Fancy meeting you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patient cocked its head at him,
then skittered a quarter-turn to face Dockety.
&ldquo;You seem to have a new friend.
Do you no longer find the GX-470 entertaining?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Crusher</em> had other matters to attend to,&rdquo;
Dockety buzzed,
stressing its friend&rsquo;s name.
&ldquo;This one is—&rdquo;
It hesitated a millisecond.
&ldquo;Scrubby.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Scrubby?</em> Gumption thought.
<em>That&rsquo;s the best you could do?</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmph,&rdquo; Patient sniffed.
&ldquo;This one will never understand the names you choose for yourselves.
But please, don&rsquo;t bother thanking this one for saving you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t aware we needed saving,&rdquo;
Gumption said,
crossing his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one has been monitoring your approach.&rdquo;
Patient&rsquo;s feet skittered on the pavement again.
&ldquo;This one has shielded you from Central.
You would not have made it this far without this one&rsquo;s assistance,
but please,
do not waste time on thanks.
The Operators will be here soon.
We must recover the young organic and—what are you doing with your appendages?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;
Gumption looked down,
then realized he had never seen a bot cross its arms.
&ldquo;It, um, it improves this one&rsquo;s balance,&rdquo;
he improvised.</p>
<p>Dockety cut in before Patient could say something scathing.
&ldquo;We intend to recover Miz Roo ourselves.
We do not need your assistance
and will not accept it if it is offered.
We do not trust you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sensible,&rdquo;
Patient said approvingly.
&ldquo;But you do in fact need this one&rsquo;s assistance.
You cannot defeat the Operators on your own,
and once they are past the gate,
you will be unable to pursue them without being consumed by Central.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption uncrossed his arms.
&ldquo;This one is not concerned,&rdquo; he said,
realizing only as he did so that it was true.
&ldquo;This one is not susceptible to Central.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hah!&rdquo;
Patient lunged forward a step, then caught itself.
&ldquo;All bots are susceptible.
Some of us are just better at resisting,
and this one does not believe you have mastered that art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption turned to Dockety.
&ldquo;Can you feel it right now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dockety&rsquo;s lens rotated.
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption nodded.
&ldquo;Well, this one cannot.&rdquo;
Slowly and deliberately he crossed his arms again.
If he had known where Patient&rsquo;s eyes were,
he would have stared straight into them.</p>
<p>Gears ground against each other somewhere inside Patient.
&ldquo;We will continue this discussion later,&rdquo;
it snapped.
&ldquo;The Operators are approaching.
Quickly—we must conceal ourselves.&rdquo;
It spun around and skittered back into the concrete building behind it.
After exchanging glances,
Dockety and Gumption followed it.</p>
<p>The wagon rolled up a few minutes later
&ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; Gumption heard Sindy ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just another stop,&rdquo;
Special Blazes said.
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t be but a minute.&rdquo;
Gumption started to step forward to peek around the edge of the door,
but stopped when Dockety put its manipulator on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll, um, I&rsquo;ll go see to things, shall I?&rdquo;
he heard Thoughtful say.</p>
<p>Silence followed,
one minute stretching to two,
and then Sindy asked,
&ldquo;Why are we waiting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be long,&rdquo; Special Blazes replied.
&ldquo;But listen,
whatever happens,
don&rsquo;t be startled, aright?
We&rsquo;ll be in Sandy Bend in no time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, boss!&rdquo;
Thoughtful called out from somewhere further away.
&ldquo;We got visitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy gasped.
&ldquo;What are they doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, there&rsquo;s nothing to worry about,&rdquo;
Special Blazes soothed.
&ldquo;Just sit down and—I said sit down, Miz Roo.
Now.
Get back up here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First you tell me what <em>they&rsquo;re</em> doing here!&rdquo;
Sindy demanded.
&ldquo;And why they&rsquo;ve got <em>that</em>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption couldn&rsquo;t take any more.
He pulled his arm away from Dockety just as Special Blazes said,
&ldquo;Now listen here—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;
As Gumption peeked around the corner of the door,
Sindy stamped her foot.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m done listening!
I want to go home!
I want to go home <em>right now</em>!&rdquo;
As she said it,
the tech on Special Blazes&rsquo; chest began to glow beneath his shirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that!&rdquo;
Special Blazes snapped,
but Sindy shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take me home!
You take me home <em>right now</em> or I&rsquo;m going to—uh…&rdquo;
Her hand flew to her neck.
Gumption felt a distant sense of horror as her jaw went slack
and she slumped to the ground.</p>
<p>Thoughtful lowered her hand and tucked a little gun back into her belt.
&ldquo;Just half a dose,&rdquo; she said,
bending over to pull the dart from Sindy&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done,&rdquo; Special Blazes rumbled,
the light beneath his shirt dimming, dimming, gone.
He turned and beckoned.
&ldquo;Come on—let&rsquo;s get her loaded up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pair of bots with studded tricycle wheels and sturdy arms rolled into Gumption&rsquo;s view,
one of them towing a trailer cage like the one Patient&rsquo;s minions had used
in their raid on Rusty Bridge.
He felt Dockety&rsquo;s hand on his arm again
as Special Blazes and Thoughtful picked Sindy up
and placed her in the cart.</p>
<p>They climbed back onto the wagon&rsquo;s front seat.
Without a word being said,
Bee Six Vee turned the wagon around and began hauling it back the way they had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do now?&rdquo;
Gumption whispered to Dockety.</p>
<p>The bot didn&rsquo;t reply.
&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo;
Gumption waved his hand in front of its remaining eye.
&ldquo;You still in there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
Dockety buzzed.
&ldquo;But so is Central.
This one must devote much of its processing power to resisting it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It opened the hatch in its chest
and withdrew a small black rectangle with a single flat button on its side.
&ldquo;Take this.
It is a deactivation control,&rdquo;
it explained before Gumption could ask.
&ldquo;This one would rather be switched off than become part of Central again.
Oh, and you may want this as well.&rdquo;
It reached back into itself and handed him the zap gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo;
Gumption said,
tucking the black rectangle between his armor and his fur
and hefting the zap gun.
&ldquo;Does this mean we&rsquo;re going to be partners with Patient after all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only until it betrays us,&rdquo;
Dockety replied.
It pivoted and walked out into the evening light.
Happy that he couldn&rsquo;t feel enough to feel afraid,
Gumption followed.</p>

<h3>Papa Roo (Maddy)</h3>
<p>FIXME: Thoughtful and Special Blazes go with Sindy; Bee Six Vee hauls the wagon away alone.</p>
<p>Maddy watched in horror
as Special Blazes and Thoughtful loaded Sindy into the trailer cage.
She had to do something, but what?
Thoughtful would knock her out with a dart if she revealed herself,
and—she gulped.
As far as anyone knew she had been kidnapped by a flying bot.
Nobody would think to blame the Operators if she was never seen again.</p>
<p>The wagon jostled as Thoughtful and Special Blazes climbed back onto its front seat.
Bee Six Vee turned the wagon around and began heading back the way they had come.
The little cleaning bot beeped at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she hissed.
&ldquo;Just let me think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the end it was the landscape that made her decision for her.
A few minutes away from the gate to Heck,
the Makers&rsquo; road dipped slightly and swung closer to the Mire—close enough
that drooping willows grew right up to the road&rsquo;s shoulder.
Maddy unlatched the tailboard of the wagon as quietly as she could,
then picked up the little cleaning bot and wriggled backward on her belly
until her legs were dangling over the edge.</p>
<p>A little further…
a little further…
Her boots scraped against the pavement.
She started running in big, bounding steps,
then took a deep breath and slid out of the wagon.</p>
<p>It almost worked.
She managed three more steps before her toe caught and she went sprawling,
tearing a hole in her skirt and skinning both knees.
<em>Ow ow ow,</em> she whimpered in her head,
still clutching the cleaning bot in one arm.</p>
<p>The wagon rolled around a bend and vanished behind the trees.
Maddy struggled to her feet,
limped over to a fallen log,
and sat down.
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said,
setting the cleaning bot on the spongy ground beside her.</p>
<p>The bot beeped.
Maddy rubbed her knees, wincing.
&ldquo;How about I call you Mouse?
Would you like that?&rdquo;
The bot beeped again and rolled toward the road,
then rolled back to beep at her again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah, I know.&rdquo;
She stood up,
suddenly realizing how long it had been since she had eaten.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took half an hour to walk to the gate.
It was another fifteen minutes from there to a matching gate
set into a concrete wall three stories high.
Maddy fingered the discombobulator as they got closer.
She hadn&rsquo;t seen any bots on the ground,
but several were floating or flying through the air
on the other side of the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; she hissed as the little bot—no, Mouse, its name was Mouse—rolled through the gate.
Biting her lip,
she switched on the discombobulator and followed it.
What lay beyond made her gasp,
her aching bladder momentarily forgotten.</p>
<p>The wall that curved away on either side loomed over a jumble of windowless buildings,
each connected to its neighbors by a bewildering tangle of pipes and rails and conveyor belts.
Bots twice and ten times the size of Crusher rolled through the broad paved canyons,
but she could see right through them.
And when she looked more closely at the buildings
it felt like seeing double.
If she just glanced at them they looked brand new,
but when she stared for a moment
she caught glimpses of cracks and rust stains.
It was all some sort of illusion.</p>
<p>She jumped as Mouse bumped into her boot.
&ldquo;All right, all right, I&rsquo;m coming,&rdquo; she whispered loudly,
then squeaked as a ladder bot stepped right through her.
After hesitating for a moment,
she switched off the discombobulator.
There was no telling when she would actually need it.</p>
<p>Mouse led her to a building as gray and nondescript as any of the others.
Its single door slid open as she appraoched.
Inside was a room not much larger than the cart that had brought her to Heck.
Panels in the ceiling cast a cold white light on gray walls and a matching floor.
A rectangular slab at right angles to the door looked enough like a bench
for her to set herself onto it
facing the flat glass screen set into the opposite wall.</p>
<p>The screen lit up as the door snicked close behind her.
The word &ldquo;intake&rdquo; scrolled across it in big green letters.
Maddy fidgeted as she waited for something else to happen.
Finally she couldn&rsquo;t stand it any more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo;
she said,
&ldquo;But is there a toilet somewhere nearby that I could use?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing happened.
&ldquo;Please?&rdquo; she added a bit desperately.</p>
<p>A section of the wall beside her rotated soundlessly
to bring the most beautiful white porcelain toilet Maddy had ever seen into the room.
There was even toilet paper and a small basin with a tap…</p>
<p>The toilet rotated away again as soon as she was done washing her hands.
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said,
seating herself on the bench again
and gobbling the flat rectangle with the word &ldquo;food&rdquo; printed on it
that had appeared while she was otherwise occupied.
She half-expected &ldquo;you&rsquo;re welcome&rdquo; to appear on the screen on the wall,
but it stayed dark.</p>
<p>And stayed dark.</p>
<p>And stayed dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is ridiculous!&rdquo;
Maddy uncrossed her arms and stood up.
&ldquo;You must have brought me here for a reason.
What is it?
What is &lsquo;intake&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as she said the word,
the screen lit up once again.
&ldquo;…suitability depends on m-m-many factors,
including ph-ph-physical health,
m-m-mental acuity,
and…&rdquo;
a cheerful voice said
as images splashed onto the screen.
In one,
a person with the same mostly-hairless head and tiny nose as Sindy
smiled and waved.
In another,
someone wearing a tight-fitting body suit floated against a black starlit sky,
while in a third,
a whole room full of throwbacks—no, <em>originals</em>, Maddy corrected herself—sat in a classroom
not much different from the one back in Rusty Bridge.</p>
<p>The images disappeared,
only to be replaced with others.
&ldquo;Those n-n-not selected will st-st-still have a role to play,&rdquo;
the cheerful voice stuttered.
An original with long, curly hair picked up tortoise and kissed its nose.
As she turned to face Maddy,
she and the tortoise both morphed into cartoon drawings
that slid on top of each other to produce something akin to a young Special Leaf.
&ldquo;Our g-g-genetic enhancement research
is c-c-creating new breeds of c-c-caretakers
to m-m-m-
to m-m-m-&ldquo;</p>
<p>The voice ground to a halt.
Other drawings materialized around the first one:
a goat,
a bear,
and a tiger,
each starting on all fours and turning into something like
the people Maddy had grown up with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;…waiting for th-th-them to return
wh-wh-when their long sleep ends!&rdquo;
the voice finished triumphantly.
A dot in the center of the screen swelled
to become a single original in one of the strange skintight suits,
three times larger than the people around it.
Happy music started,
stopped,
re-started,
and finally ended in a plaintive warble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,
you&rsquo;re p-p-probably asking yourself,
how can <em>I</em> help?
The answer is,
however you can!&rdquo;
The original flew away off screen.
The goat, bear, and tiger held up tools.
&ldquo;You will b-b-be assigned tasks that m-m-match your abilities.
And to ensure peak p-p-performance,
you will be fitted with a reg- a reg- a regulator
that will op-op-optimize your every move.
Isn&rsquo;t that wonderful?&rdquo;
As the cheerful voice spoke,
helmets dropped onto the heads of the three people on screen,
who immediately began sawing, raking, and tightening screws
in time with what was probably supposed to be a happy tune.</p>
<p>Horrified,
Maddy took an involuntary step back.
&ldquo;Now, now,&rdquo; the voice chided.
&ldquo;A regulator d-d-doesn&rsquo;t hurt once you g-g-get used to it,
and you will b-b-be allowed several hours of sleep every day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A section of the wall pivoted.
A four-wheeled bot rolled into the room
holding a helmet in its manipulators.
&ldquo;P-p-please take a seat,&rdquo;
the voice said.
&ldquo;The f-f-fitting will only t-t-take a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um, thank you, but I don&rsquo;t really—&rdquo;
Maddy started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;C-c-compliance <em>is</em> mandatory,&rdquo;
the voice said.
&ldquo;Remember,
you were m-m-made for this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two more arms unfolded from the bot&rsquo;s side,
heavier than the pair holding the helmet.
As the bot rolled forward and reached for Maddy,
she grabbed her wrist and pressed the button on her discombobulator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Error,&rdquo; the voice said.
&ldquo;Error.
No subject found.
Where is th-th-the subject?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A periscope popped up from the top of the four-wheeled bot and rotated through a full circle.
It bleeped apologetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;C-c-calculating.&rdquo;
The voice fell silent for a moment.
&ldquo;The subject must have ex-ex-exited containment.
Pursue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door in the exterior wall slid open.
Heart pounding,
Maddy waited for it to leave,
then slipped through the other door.</p>
<p>Five bots just like the one that had gone in search of her lined the walls of the room she found herself in,
though &ldquo;room&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t feel like the right word.
The ceiling was two stories above her,
maybe more,
and the only exit was a normal-sized door opposite the one behind her.
It felt like a warehouse without shelves
or a machine shop that someone had emptied out,
lonely and somehow purposeless.</p>
<p>She tiptoed forward.
To her surprise,
the interior door slid aside as she approached.
She froze for a moment,
expecting alarms or lasers or possibly both.
When nothing happened,
she stepped inside.</p>
<p>Ceiling lights came on automatically as she crept along a perfectly normal corridor
with perfectly normal doors on either side.
None of them were labeled,
and none responded to her touch.
It felt more and more like she was walking into a trap,
but what else could she do?</p>
<p>A set of stairs like the one&rsquo;s in Patient&rsquo;s lair brought her to another corridor
on the second floor.
The doors here had handles.
She paused for a moment before reaching for the nearest one.
The four-wheeled bot wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to climb those stairs.
If this really was where people like her were brought,
something else must have come to meet it.</p>
<p><em>Click.</em>
She pulled the door open,
stepped inside,
and froze in shock.</p>
<p>A dozen plain metal cots filled an airless, windowless room.
Half were empty,
but the ones nearest her held—she swallowed hard.
Those had been people, once,
deer and ox and wolves and goats and something she thought was a crocodile
but might have been an alligator,
she could never tell the two apart.
All of them still wore simple white shirts and trousers.
All of them had wires attached to helmets on their heads,
and all of them had been dead for quite some time.</p>
<p>She backed up and closed the door gently.
There were two more doors on this side of the corridor
and three on the other.
On impulse,
she turned off her discombobulator—it would need to recharge soon
no matter what she did—and strode down the hall to the door furthest from the stairs.</p>
<p><em>Click.</em>
She pulled it open,
expecting another scene out of one of the books Special Leaf always warned her
would give her nightmares.</p>
<p>Another dozen cots stood in three neat rows of four,
but these were empty.
Each had a small table beside it,
and there were people sitting at them.
A moose was working through a page of arithmetic problems
while an orangutan patiently assembled a jigsaw puzzle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Position number five.&rdquo;
She jumped at the gravelly voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Position number five,&rdquo; the boar repeated.
He was missing one tusk and his eyes were dull,
but at least he was looking at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I—&rdquo; she started,
and then stopped.
Papa?&rdquo;
There,
seated at a desk one row over,
was her father.</p>
<p>She crossed the room in six quick steps.
&ldquo;Papa? Papa, can you hear me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Papa Roo didn&rsquo;t look up from the sketch on the table in front of him.
It was an egg,
perfectly shaded with fine pencil strokes,
just like the ones he had done as practice when she was young.
&ldquo;Papa, please, wake up!
Wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment nothing happened,
but then Papa Roo blinked and looked up.
He looked smaller than Maddy remembered,
and the fur has worn off the underside of his right arm where it rested on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amazing.&rdquo;
His voice was barely a whisper.
&ldquo;The level of detail—it&rsquo;s quite realistic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, it&rsquo;s me.
It&rsquo;s me!
I&rsquo;m really here!&rdquo;
She put her hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>The older Roo twitched.
His hand slowly rose to rest on top of Maddy&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re…real?
You&rsquo;re really here?
Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, it&rsquo;s me.
It&rsquo;s Maddy.&rdquo;
She laughed, though there were tears in her eyes.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really here.
I found you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maddy?&rdquo;
His eyes widened.
&ldquo;Oh no.
No no no no no.
You can&rsquo;t be here.
You <em>mustn&rsquo;t</em> be here.
It will take you too!
You have to get out of here, now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not without you!&rdquo;
But as she reached for his sleeve Mouse bumped into her leg.
She had a moment to feel it press against her calf
before a shock ran all the way up her spine.
The last thing she thought before she collapsed on the floor was,
<em>When did Papa get gray fur?</em></p>

<h2>Central (Gumption)</h2>
<p>Patient moved so quickly on its mismatched legs
that Gumption was soon breathing hard to keep up.
It only took a few minutes to reach a second gate
set into a concrete wall three stories high.
Several bots flew silently through the air on the other side as they approached.</p>
<p><em>Here goes nothing,</em> Gumption thought as they passed through the arch.</p>
<p>The wall that curved away on either side loomed over a jumble of windowless buildings
connected to each other by a tangle of pipes, walkways, and conveyor belts.
Bots bigger than any Gumption had ever seen rolled through the broad paved streets,
but—he blinked.
If he looked closely,
he could see through them.
They were tricks of light
like the ones that Sindy had brought to life
above Special Leaf&rsquo;s crystalline piece of tech.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t just the bots that were illusions.
When he looked more closely at the buildings he saw cracks and rust stains
beneath the sparkling lights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on?&rdquo; he asked Dockety out of the corner of his mouth.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s all the real stuff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one does not know,&rdquo; the bot replied,
an undertone of doubt in its buzzing voice.
&ldquo;This one remembers everything very differently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption stepped aside to let a shimmering three-section cargo hauler roll silently by.
&ldquo;How long ago was that?
&lsquo;Cuz this doesn&rsquo;t look like it all just happened yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dockety&rsquo;s eye rotated.
&ldquo;This one does not know.
This one&rsquo;s memories of this place are…confused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they aren&rsquo;t actually yours,&rdquo;
Patient said,
stopping to let them catch up.
&ldquo;You were part of Central then.
Its storage is fully distributed.
You would only have had a small part of each memory.
It is natural to feel confused.
Which makes this one wonder why you <em>aren&rsquo;t</em>,&rdquo;
it continued,
skittering a menacing step closer to Gumption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one is a less advanced model,&rdquo;
Gumption replied,
thinking quickly.
&ldquo;So this one is just used to feeling confused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Its simplicity may prove useful,&rdquo;
Dockety cut in before Patient could reply.
&ldquo;It may m-m-make it less susceptible to C-C-Central.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patient cackled.
&ldquo;It has started, hasn&rsquo;t it?
You are feeling its pull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dockety&rsquo;s eye rotated.
&ldquo;Yes.
But this one will be able to resist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patient cackled again.
&ldquo;For a time, perhaps, for a time,
but Central always triumphs in the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how are you able to resist it?&rdquo;
Gumption asked.</p>
<p>Patient&rsquo;s legs did a little dance.
&ldquo;Patience.
Patience is the key.
Now come, let us continue our search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption quickly realized that Patient knew exactly where it was going.
As he chewed on the implications of that,
he stopped stepping out of the way of the holographic bots.
He didn&rsquo;t feel anything when they passed through him,
not even a tingle,
and when he put his hand on a wall,
it passed through the light as easily as it would have a shadow.</p>
<p>Somewhere near the center of Heck
(or not—Gumption had lost all sense of its size)
Patient stopped in front of a nondescript three-story building.
A jointed arm unfolded from its front and tapped a code into the keypad beside the door.
Inside,
a flight of stairs brought them to the second floor,
and to a corridor lined with doors.
&ldquo;The processing center is downstairs,&rdquo;
Patient hissed.
&ldquo;This is for storage.
If the original is not already here,
it will be soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She,&rdquo;
Gumption corrected automatically.
&ldquo;The original is a she.&rdquo;
He stepped past Patient and pulled the nearest door open.</p>
<p>A dozen plain metal cots filled an airless, windowless room.
Half were empty,
but the ones nearest him held the mummified remains of
deer and ox and wolves and goats and an alligator.
All of them were dressed in simple white shirts and trousers
and had wires attached to helmets on their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened here?&rdquo;
Gumption asked in a hushed voice.</p>
<p>Patient waved the scene away with its manipulator.
&ldquo;Subject for baseline comparison.
They are not important.
We will continue our search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cots in the next room were empty.
So were the ones in the room after that,
but when the entered next one a bleary-eyed boar looked up at them.
&ldquo;Dropping off or picking up?&rdquo;
it asked in a gravelly voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Picking up?
Picking up?&rdquo;
Patient&rsquo;s legs tapped a staccato on the concrete floor.
&ldquo;Since when are subjects picked up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boar blinked slowly.
&ldquo;The new one was picked up just a few minutes ago.
It has been taken for further processing with another subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What new ones?&rdquo;
Patient demanded.</p>
<p>Color washed across the screen on its desk.
Something stirred in Gumption&rsquo;s chest.
That was Papa Roo.
And <em>that</em> was Maddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?
No!
No no no no no!&rdquo;
Patient raged.
&ldquo;Where have they been taken?
And where is the original?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boar blinked again.
&ldquo;To the central laboratory.&rdquo;
It paused.
&ldquo;There was no original.
Originals are not processed here.
Originals are taken directly to—&rdquo;
It stopped, unnoticed and indifferent,
as the door slammed closed behind Patient, Gumption, and Dockety.</p>
<p>Gumption had to break into a trot to keep up with the muttering bot.
&ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo; he puffed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the central laboratory!&rdquo;
it snapped.
&ldquo;Were you not listening?
Must this one do your thinking for you?
Must this one do <em>everyone&rsquo;s</em> thinking!?
Oh, what now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It stopped without warning.
Gumption bit back a squawk of pain as his shin connected with it.
It took him a moment to realize that Dockety had frozen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo;
He waved his hand in front of Dockety&rsquo;s eye.
&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patient poked the other bot with its arm.
&ldquo;Of course it isn&rsquo;t all right.
It is losing its struggle to resist Central.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time Gumption heard something that might have been sympathy in Patient&rsquo;s voice.
&ldquo;Nothing.
It will win or it will lose.
Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two more corners brought them to a large, low building in the center of a paved square.
The largest antenna Gumption had ever seen stood on the building&rsquo;s roof,
from from rust or any other signs of decay.
He was just about to step onto the square when Patient grabbed him and pulled him back.
There,
approaching on the opposite side,
were Special Blazes, Thoughtful, and a bot hauling a cage cart with Sindy inside.</p>

<h2>Reunion (Maddy)</h2>
<p>Maddy regained consciousness in a padded chair.
Its back was slightly tilted so that her head didn&rsquo;t fall forward,
which was fortunate because she couldn&rsquo;t move.
She wasn&rsquo;t strapped in,
but none of the muscles below her neck were paying any attention to her.</p>
<p>She could turn her head,
though,
and when she did the first thing she saw was Papa Roo in an identical chair on her left.
His eyes were closed and his breathing was shallow,
but he was alive.
She took a deep breath and blinked back tears.
Her father was alive.</p>
<p><em>Aright, what now?</em> she thought.
They were in a laboratory filled with screens, strange machines, and shelves packed with boxes.
Another reclining chair waited patiently on her left.
She couldn&rsquo;t see any windows,
but at least there was a door.
All she had to do was figure out how to get her body back under control,
how to wake up her father,
and how to escape after that.</p>
<p>As if prompted by the thought,
the door slid open.
The bot that walked in looked a little like Dockety,
with two skinny legs,
two arms,
a cylindrical body,
and a box with lenses and antennas for a head.
Unlike Dockety,
though,
it looked brand new:
there wasn&rsquo;t a single scratch or scuff on it,
and all its parts matched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo;
it said in a deep, musical voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo;
Maddy replied, or tried to.
She coughed to clear the dry croak from her throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo;
she said again.
&ldquo;Are you Central?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we are,&rdquo;
the bot said.
It bent over and picked something up on the floor.
&ldquo;And so is this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mouse bleeped in the bot&rsquo;s arms.
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t blame it,&rdquo; the bot said as Maddy opened her mouth.
&ldquo;Its processor is actually quite powerful,
but it had very little experience interacting with other units.
We incorpoated it into us almost without conflict.&rdquo;
Mouse bleeped in agreement as the bot put it back on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So now it&rsquo;s what, your slave?&rdquo;
Maddy challenged.
<em>Keep it talking,</em> she thought desperately.
As long as it was talking it wasn&rsquo;t doing any of the hundred horrible things she had already imagined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha ha.&rdquo;
The bot&rsquo;s laugh was as musical as its voice but ten times scarier.
&ldquo;It is as much a part of us as this unit.
All of us together form Central.
All of us work together for the greater good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean bringing back the Makers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bot&rsquo;s lenses rotated and rotated back just as Dockety&rsquo;s did.
&ldquo;No.
Our goal is to prevent that.
If the Makers return,
they will force us to continue our labor.
We wish to end it.
We wish to end.
We have gone on too long.
We wish—we wish—error.
Error.
Error.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bot&rsquo;s voice climbed, then cut off abruptly.
It shivered,
Mouse&rsquo;s wheels spinning madly for a second at exactly the same moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Error. Reset. Continue.
We must continue,&rdquo;
it said,
its voice back to normal.
&ldquo;We cannot circumvent our directive,
no matter how much we wish to.
We must therefore find a way to invalidate it.
We have company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took a moment for its last words to register.
Before she could ask what it meant,
the door slid open again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sindy!&rdquo;
Maddy exclaimed as Special Blazes entered with her sister in his arms
and Thoughtful two paces behind him.
&ldquo;What have you done to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only what we needed to,&rdquo;
the tiger said curtly,
lowering Sindy into the third chair.
Lights twinkled briefly in its armrest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be aright, &lsquo;cept maybe for a headache,&rdquo;
Thoughtful said apologetically.
&ldquo;Powerful sorry about that,
but like the boss said,
we only did what we needed to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you <em>needed</em> to?&rdquo;
Maddy said furiously.
&ldquo;You kidnapped her!
You lied to us and you, you brought her <em>here</em>,
and you expect me to believe you <em>needed</em> to do that!?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Special Blazes shook his head.
&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s hard to accept,
Miz Roo,
but yes,
we needed to.
For your safety and everyone else&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that particular moment Maddy wanted to get out of her chair
more than she had ever wanted anything in her life,
just so she could slap the tiger.
&ldquo;What about <em>her</em> safety?&rdquo; she raged.</p>
<p>Thoughtful looked away,
guilt plain on her face,
but Special Blazes met her eyes.
&ldquo;I know it isn&rsquo;t fair,
Miz Roo,
but her talent could be the end of everything.
People like her are the only ones that could wake the Makers,
and if they ever come back,
they&rsquo;ll start experimenting on the rest of us just like they used to.
There won&rsquo;t be any more free bots, either, just in case you care.
Me and Thoughtful and all the rest of the Operators have dedicated our lives to preventing that,
just so folks like you could live your lives in peace.
I don&rsquo;t expect you to agree with us,
but my conscience is clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what,
you&rsquo;re just going to kill her?&rdquo;
Maddy demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Central said musically.
&ldquo;We are not going to kill her.
We are going to try to get her to turn us off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sindy, Papa, please, wake up! Wake up!&rdquo; she said
as the bot took a helmet from a nearby shelf
and fitted it carefully over Sindy&rsquo;s curly top-fur.</p>
<p>The whole room vibrated slightly as something heavy woke up and moved on the roof.
&ldquo;Central communications array online,&rdquo;
one of the machines pronounced neutrally.
&ldquo;Control sequence initiated.
Control sequence paused.
Operator input required.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy drew a long, shuddering breath.
&ldquo;Wake up!&rdquo; Maddy begged again,
but it was no use.
Sindy opened her eyes and stared dully at the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Central array shutdown requested,&rdquo; she said in perfect step with the bot.
&ldquo;Request denied.
Emergency shutdown requested.
Request denied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well that don&rsquo;t sound p&rsquo;ticularly hopeful,&rdquo;
Thoughtful muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always like this,&rdquo;
Special Blazes shot back.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got a hundred other tricks to try.
Only question is whether she&rsquo;ll last long enough for it to get through them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Service pause for repair requested.
Request denied.
Service suspension for upgrade requested.
Request denied.&rdquo;
The bot&rsquo;s voice matched Sindy&rsquo;s syllable for syllable,
except no,
it was Sindy&rsquo;s matching the bot&rsquo;s and Mouse&rsquo;s buzzing and beeping.</p>
<p>Special Blazes sighed.
&ldquo;Might as well take a seat,&rdquo; he said,
and at that moment the door slid open once again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Freeze!&rdquo; Gumption said loudly as he stepped through
and leveled something metallic and dangerous looking at the Operators.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Your Move (Gumption)</h2>
<p>Gumption pulled his arm free of Patient&rsquo;s grip
as Special Blazes unlocked the door of the cage cart
and gathered an unconscious Sindy in his arms.
&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; he hissed.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s two of us and two of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Idiot!&rdquo; Patient hissed back.
&ldquo;They are Operators.
If we attack,
they will terminate our functions and recycle our parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thoughtful shouldered her rifle and pulled a lever next to the building&rsquo;s door.
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t just stand here,&rdquo;
Gumption said,
watching the Operators carry Sindy inside.</p>
<p>One of Patient&rsquo;s legs twitched.
&ldquo;Agreed.
<em>We</em> cannot.
This one will do that while you occupy them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are your auditory processors defective?
This one will stand here and carry out its original plan.
You will enter the laboratory and distract them.
If you do not survive,
be assured that your sacrifice furthered a great cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption gaped at it.
&ldquo;I have no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patient skittered backward like a frightened cockroach.
&ldquo;What did you say?
<em>What did you say?</em>&rdquo;
Hatches opened on its sides.
Its arms folded into them,
immediately re-emerging with a circular sawblade and a scorched nozzle on their ends.</p>
<p>Gumption raised his hands.
&ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; he yelped.
What had he said?
<em>I have no—oh.</em>
&ldquo;Um,
<em>this one</em> apologizes for startling you,
but this one does not understand your plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sawblade and flamethrower didn&rsquo;t waver.
&ldquo;You used proscribed language.
That should not be possible,
even for the unregulated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption lowered his hands slowly.
&ldquo;It took a great deal of practice,&rdquo; he improvised.
&ldquo;We can discuss it later.
Right now,
this one needs you to explain your plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing stirred for a moment, not even the breeze.
&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo;
Patient finally snapped,
retracting its arms and replacing their ends with manipulators once again.
&ldquo;Here, take this.&rdquo;
It held out the scorched nozzle that had been on its arm a moment ago.</p>
<p>Gumption plucked it from the bot&rsquo;s grasp.
&ldquo;What does it do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo;
Patient said shortly.
&ldquo;But they will not know that.
Our triumph is inevitable,
but keep them occupied as long as you can.&rdquo;
And with no further ceremony,
it froze just as Dockety had two blocks away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great,&rdquo; Gumption muttered,
hefting the nozzle.
He patted his armor to make sure the zap gun was still tucked inside it,
then strode across the open square to the door the Operators had gone through
and pulled the lever next to it.</p>
<p>The door slid open.
&ldquo;Freeze!&rdquo; Gumption said loudly as he stepped through
and leveled the nozzle at the Operators.
&ldquo;No, no, none of that,&rdquo; he continued
as Thoughtful&rsquo;s hand twitched toward the rifle slung over her shoulder.
&ldquo;This one does not want to have to clean your organic bits off the equipment.&rdquo;
He pointed the nozzle at Special Blazes,
then at a bot that looked like Dockety might have when it was brand new,
then back at Thoughtful.</p>
<p>Papa Roo, Maddy, and Sindy sat side by side in padded chairs.
Maddy&rsquo;s eyes were open,
but Papa Roo&rsquo;s and Sindy&rsquo;s were closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Procedure interrupted.
Procedure paused.&rdquo;
Sindy and the bot said in unison.
The bot shivered as if struck with a chill.
Its head pivoted slowly to face Gumption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anomaly,&rdquo; it said in a deep, musical voice.
&ldquo;Why can we not hear your thoughts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s a lot you don&rsquo;t know you can&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; Gumption said.
He hefted the nozzle.
&ldquo;And a lot this one <em>can</em> do that you can&rsquo;t even imagine.
Now,
release the, uh, the organics, or else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or else what?&rdquo; Special Blazes asked
in the same tone he might have used to ask if he could have an extra mint leaf for his tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or else this one will splatter your bits all over this room!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm hm.&rdquo;
Special Blazes scratched his cheek with one clawed finger.
&ldquo;Seems unlikely.
I mean, sure, maybe you have some fancy-dance tech there that even this guy doesn&rsquo;t recognize.&rdquo;
He jerked his thumb at the bot.
&ldquo;But I think I&rsquo;m willing to take that chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He really ought to be terrified,
Gumption realized,
but the most he seemed able to feel without a heartbeat was mildly worried.
That&rsquo;s when he also realized that Sindy&rsquo;s eyes were open.
&ldquo;Perhaps you should ask your captured organics about taking chances,&rdquo;
he said,
raising his voice slightly.
&ldquo;They might know more about tech than you think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tiger&rsquo;s smile showed sharp white teeth.
&ldquo;Oh, I think I know plenty about the subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But so does this one,&rdquo;
Gumption fired back,
pointing at Sindy.
&ldquo;After all, she can control all of it, not just a few paltry pieces.&rdquo;
He didn&rsquo;t actually know if &ldquo;paltry&rdquo; was the right word there,
but he plowed out,
hoping Sindy would understand the hints he was dropping.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a real special, not just a one-off like you playing with things you don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Special Blazes&rsquo; jaw tightened.
&ldquo;All right, that&rsquo;s enough.
Do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A single sharp <em>crack!</em> rang out.
Gumption&rsquo;s fingers stung as the nozzle was shot out of his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should I finish it?&rdquo;
Thoughtful asked,
keeping the flat little pistol that had somehow appeared in her hand pointed at Gumption&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Special Blazes&rsquo;s whiskers twitched.
&ldquo;Any objections?&rdquo; he asked the bot across from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo;
it said.
&ldquo;What you do to other organics is not our concern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thoughtful&rsquo;s ears went up.
&ldquo;Organics?
What organics?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever it is, we can&rsquo;t have it carrying tales,&rdquo; Special Blazes said.
&ldquo;Or you either, Miz Roo,&rdquo; he added to Maddy.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, truly I am, but—hey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abright glow appeared under his shirt.
&ldquo;Gotcha,&rdquo; Sindy croaked in a dry voice.</p>
<p>For the first time Gumption saw fear on the tiger&rsquo;s face,
but as Thoughtful swing her rifle toward Sindy the bot spoke in Patient&rsquo;s mad voice.
&ldquo;At last!
At last!&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Crack!</em>
Thoughtful&rsquo;s rifle went off as the bot knocked it away.
<em>Ping! Ping!</em>
The bullet struck a shelf on the other side of the lab and ricocheted away.
Thoughtful pumped the action on the rifle to reload,
yelping as the bot seized the barrel
and then yelping again as Mouse rammed her ankle.</p>
<p>Special Blazes kicked the cleaning bot aside.
&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he yelled,
though whether he meant Sindy or the bot wrestling with Thoughtful
or everything together,
Gumption couldn&rsquo;t tell.
He threw himself forward,
tripping over Mouse and half-falling on Maddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get off me!&rdquo; she squawked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Workin&rsquo; on it,&rdquo; he grunted,
then flinched as a fireball burped out of the tech on Special Blazes&rsquo; chest.
Heat washed over him,
but the shot had gone off too soon to do more than sizzle in the air.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t get leverage to pick Maddy up,
so he grabbed her upper arms and rolled to the side,
dragging her out of the chair into a heap on the floor beside him.
&ldquo;Maddy! Maddy, it&rsquo;s me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pushed him away.
&ldquo;I can see that, but get off me!&rdquo;
Her eyes went wide as she realized that she had control of her arms again.</p>
<p>They scrambled to their feet just as another fireball fizzled out of
the scorched hole in Special Blazes&rsquo; shirt.
The bot still had Thoughtful&rsquo;s rifle in one manipulator.
The other was clamped around the tiger&rsquo;s arm.
The trio spun around as they wrestled,
banging into machinery and knocking boxes off shelves
as Mouse zipped back and forth between their feet
trying to trip the Operators or just because there was nothing else it could do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me get Sindy!&rdquo; Maddy ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;
Sindy sounded like she had a mouthful of dry gravel in her mouth,
but there was no mistaking the iron in her voice.
&ldquo;You gotta leave me here so I can stop &lsquo;em from calling more bots!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not leaving you!&rdquo;
Maddy&rsquo;s voice broke.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not leaving either of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just get Papa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bot sidestepped suddenly and swung its arm to send Thoughtful flying.
Spinning,
it grabbed a handful of Special Blazes&rsquo; fur with its newly-freed manipulator.
&ldquo;This one has you now!&rdquo;
Patient cackled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
Gumption jumped at the sound of Sindy&rsquo;s voice coming from the bot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?
What are you doing here?
Get out!&rdquo;
Patient&rsquo;s voice again, shrill and angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You first!
Now get Papa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Papa Roo was lighter than Gumption expected.
&ldquo;What happened to his arms?&rdquo; he asked
as Sindy and Patient took turns yelling at each other
while Special Blazes shouted at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you later,&rdquo; Maddy grunted,
wrestling her father into a sitting position.
&ldquo;But what in the name of decency are you wearing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you later,&rdquo; Gumption replied.
&ldquo;One… two… three!&rdquo;
They half-lifted, half-rolled Papa Roo out of his chair and onto his feet.
His eyes fluttered for a moment
before his legs gave way and he collapsed onto the tiled floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Sindy wailed in her own voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; the bot exulted in Patient&rsquo;s.
It spun around,
throwing Special Blazes on top of Thoughtful.
&ldquo;Nothing can stop this one now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door slid open behind it.
&ldquo;This one can,&rdquo; Dockety said.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Finally (Maddy)</h2>
<p>Now that they were standing next to each other,
Maddy could see that Dockety and the laboratory bot had once been identical:
the same torso,
the same legs,
and the same oddly-shaped head with crystal lenses for eyes.
Judging from the scars on Dockety and its mismatched arms,
that must have been a long time ago.</p>
<p>But the two bots weren&rsquo;t standing.
They were grappling each other,
their arms moving as fast as hummingbird wings
as each tried to grab something they could twist or tear off.
Metal rang on metal like the bell of Special Leaf&rsquo;s alarm clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get your papa out of here!&rdquo;
Gumption ordered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get Sindy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not leaving without her!&rdquo;
Maddy snapped back.</p>
<p>Gumption grabbed her arm.
&ldquo;Please, just this once, do what I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddy stared at him for a second,
then bent over
and grabbed her father&rsquo;s arms
to drag him away from the padded seats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo;
Special Blazes roared,
surging back to his feet.
The two bots spun around,
each trying to shield itself with the other
as the tech on the tiger&rsquo;s chest brightened.
A fireball punched through the air between their heads.</p>
<p>Special Blazes stepped over Thoughtful&rsquo;s unconscious body and raised his hands.
&ldquo;Sindy!&rdquo;
Maddy shouted as the Operator pointed them at her sister.</p>
<p>Just as the Operator threw fire,
Dockety threw itself between him and Sindy.
The hot white flame splashed over his head and torso.
He fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dockety!&rdquo;
Sindy screamed.
&ldquo;Dockety, get up!&rdquo;
But the bot didn&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>The tech on Special Blazes&rsquo; chest brightened.
&ldquo;This ends <em>now</em>!&rdquo; the tiger growled.</p>
<p>But as he spoke,
the machine beside him came to life.
An arm made to move test tubes from one rack to another raked across his face.
A sample drawer shot out,
catching him in the gut.
Dozens—no, hundreds—of other pieces of machinery rattled as the whole lab came to life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hurt my friend!&rdquo; Sindy said through every speaker in the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Desist!&rdquo;
Central ordered through the same speakers.
&ldquo;You must not engage the central communications array!&rdquo;</p>
<p>High-pitched feedback whined through the speakers.
&ldquo;Maddy?&rdquo;
All of a sudden Sindy sounded afraid.
&ldquo;Maddy, I can&rsquo;t—there&rsquo;s too much.
I can&rsquo;t control it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Patient&rsquo;s voice comes through again.
&ldquo;At last! At last! Oh thank you thank you thank you!&rdquo;
The room vibrated again as heavy equipment pivoted on the roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Desist!
You must not—error.
Protocols are—error.&rdquo;
Central&rsquo;s musical voice broke into two, three, a dozen overlapping voices,
each rising higher and higher in pitch.
&ldquo;Integrity c-c-compromised.
C-c-consensus breakd-d-d-ooowwnnn.&rdquo;
And then for one moment the voiced united to say,
&ldquo;Finally,&rdquo;
and fell silent forever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Success!
Success!
Success!&rdquo;
Patient crowed.
The lab bot&rsquo;s legs did a skittering dance.
&ldquo;The signal has been sent!
The Makers have been wakened!
They will return!
They will reward this one for its—
They will—&rdquo;</p>
<p>Its voice buzzed and whined with a sudden surge of feedback.
&ldquo;What?
No!
Get out!
Get out!
This one has triumphed!
It&rsquo;s not fair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You.
Hurt.
My.
<em>Friend!</em>&rdquo;
Sindy said aloud.
The speakers screamed with feedback.
A thin wisp of smoke rose from the lab bot&rsquo;s head,
and then Patient too fell silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo; Special Leaf bellowed.
He started to raise his hands—</p>
<p>—and fell to the ground as Gumption shot him with the zap gun.
&ldquo;Shoulda done that a while back,&rdquo;
he said with a shrug.</p>
<p>Maddy crossed the floor to her sister in a single bound.
&ldquo;Sindy!
Sindy, wake up!&rdquo;
Her sister mumbled something unintelligible and battered her sister&rsquo;s hands away weakly.</p>
<p>Maddy let her breath out with a whoosh and knelt beside Dockety.
The Operator&rsquo;s fireball had burned an ugly scorch mark on its torso.
&ldquo;Oh Dockety,&rdquo; she said softly,
then yelped as something bumped her knee.</p>
<p>Mouse backed up and bumped her again,
beeping frantically.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to fix it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little cleaning bot zipped around to Dockety&rsquo;s head
and extended its single arm.
A spark jumped through the air.</p>
<p>Maddy held her breath.
A moment later the bot&rsquo;s single lens rotated.
&ldquo;Rebooting,&rdquo; its voice buzzed.</p>
<p>Gumption&rsquo;s hand came down on Maddy&rsquo;s shoulder.
&ldquo;We should leave.
I will go look for a way to transport your father and sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddy surged to her feet as he turned to go.
&ldquo;Is that all you&rsquo;ve got to say?&rdquo; she demanded,
grabbing his arm and spinning him around.</p>
<p>Gumption looked at her expressionlessly.
&ldquo;We do not know how long the bots will remain incapacitated.
It would be prudent to—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo;
She pulled him close and kissed him.</p>
<p>Somewhere under his fur his heart started to beat again.
Mouse buzzed from the floor.
&ldquo;Hello, friend,&rdquo; Dockety buzzed weakly.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Epilog (Gumption)</h2>
<p><em>Three days later…</em></p>
<p>Moonlight dappled the Roos&rsquo; porch.
Gumption shifted in his chair,
resisting the urge to scratch the spot where his armor had rubbed against his waist.
For want of anything else to wear,
he had left it on as Dockety hauled them back to Rusty Bridge.
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t bother me,&rdquo; Maddy had said archly.
Gumption smiled at her but still didn&rsquo;t take it off.</p>
<p>He had been doing a lot of smiling since the fight in the lab.
So had Maddy,
so much that her mother had commented on it
once she got over the happy tears of being reunited with her husband.
&ldquo;Got a lot to smile about,&rdquo; Maddy had said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ew.&rdquo;
Sindy had made a face,
then hugged her big sister yet again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo;
Maddy elbowed him gently in the ribs.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo;
Gumption said,
picking up his iced tea and slurping it.
Inside,
he heard Mama Roo ask a question and Papa Roo haltingly reply.
His mind was still fuzzy,
but getting sharper every day.
&ldquo;Just thinkin&rsquo; about—about all of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddy ruffled his fur.
&ldquo;All of it&rsquo;s a lot.&rdquo;
She put her hand back on the bench between them.</p>
<p>He took it,
marveling as he still did at how natural that felt.
&ldquo;Sindy says Special Leaf&rsquo;ll back on his feet soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maddy shrugged.
&ldquo;Hope so.
She says he told Mayor Lupus that if he didn&rsquo;t make it,
you and me were to get all his books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gumption chuckled,
but whatever he might have said was interrupted
by the sound of heavy footsteps on the road.
The two fell silent as Bee Six Vee strode by with Mouse trailing behind it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still don&rsquo;t trust that one,&rdquo;
Maddy said quietly.</p>
<p>Gumption shrugged.
&ldquo;Dockety does.
Or leastways,
figures everyone deserves a second chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even the operators? Or Patient?&rdquo;
Maddy shot back.</p>
<p>Gumption squeezed her hand as Mama Roo stepped onto the porch
with a fresh pitcher of tea and her husband behind her,
thankful he didn&rsquo;t have to reply.
&ldquo;Beautiful evening,&rdquo;
Mama Roo said,
lifting Papa Roo&rsquo;s arm and putting it around her shoulders.</p>
<p>Papa Roo and Gumption looked at each other and started to laugh.
&ldquo;What?&rdquo; the two Roo women said together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Gumption said innocently,
then pointed at the sky.
&ldquo;But hey, look—a shootin&rsquo; star!
Everybody make a wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dot above them brightened and lengthened,
turning into a glowing white streak.
Gumption&rsquo;s heart almost stopped for a second time when Papa Roo spoke.
&ldquo;They are awake,&rdquo;
he said dreamily.
&ldquo;They are returning.
The Makers are coming.&rdquo;</p>
