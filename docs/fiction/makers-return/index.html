<h1>The Makers Return</h1>



<ul>
<li>Final book in the trilogy<ul>
<li>Will be a good opportunity for me to practice endings</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Major points<ul>
<li>The last of the Makers&rsquo; ships returns</li>
<li>Only a couple of adults have survived: the other passengers are all children</li>
<li>They think bots and &ldquo;brids&rdquo; (hybrids) are meant to serve them</li>
<li>Blazes and other hard-line Operators want to go to war</li>
<li>The bots are split as well: form an uneasy alliance with the Operators</li>
<li>A child from each side must work together to prevent war</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Story is told from two points of view<ul>
<li>Sindy has never felt like she fits in</li>
<li>Violet&rsquo;s whole world is gone</li>
<li>But Violet has spoken with several imprisoned brids over the years</li>
<li>Refer back to &ldquo;In Heck&rdquo; encounter with Maddy</li>
<li>Sindy: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not one of them (meaning hybrids), but I&rsquo;m not one of you either (meaning human).&rdquo;</li>
<li>Violet (later, to the adult humans): &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not one of them (meaning hybrids), but I&rsquo;m not one of you any more.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Big bang at the end<ul>
<li>Patient restores itself from a backup copy</li>
<li>Is furious that the Makers aren&rsquo;t what it expected</li>
<li>So it wants to blow up their ship (and the whole valley with it)</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Violet asks &ldquo;What about the others?&rdquo;</li>

<h3>Chapter 4: Violet</h3>
<ul>
<li>Doctor Meadows and Captain Lawson are making preparations for landing<ul>
<li>Takes a while to check out all the systems, many of which are damaged</li>
<li>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been asleep a lot longer than we planned&rdquo; (but never specify exactly how long)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Violet is bored, but every time she asks André to play he sulks (they don&rsquo;t see each other)<ul>
<li>Mirrors the isolation that Sindy feels</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>André retreats to the virtual world they had access to while they were in cryo<ul>
<li>Violet has had enough of that</li>
<li>Remembers meeting hybrids, but they were all upset or bewildered</li>
<li>Doctor Meadows clearly knows they were real, but is uncomfortable discussing it</li>
<li>Violet still doesn&rsquo;t see Doctor Meadows in person</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Starts a conversation and only belatedly realizes she&rsquo;s <em>not</em> talking to the computer</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Captain Lawson comes in and turns off the comms (angry)</li>
</ul>

<li>Bluster and Bravo make fun of her</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Everyone is distracted by the arrival of Special Blazes and his new partner Nash<ul>
<li>Tense scenes with the mayor and the bots (Dockety and Beevy)</li>
<li>Show Blazes&rsquo; anger at Beevy and how cold-blooded Nash is (yes, it&rsquo;s a stereotype)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then the ship starts to come down in a ball of fire</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chapter 6: Violet</h3>
<ul>
<li>Describe the landing from her point of view<ul>
<li>A moment when she and André are both frightened and he&rsquo;s <em>not</em> a jerk</li>
<li>But she still doesn&rsquo;t see him or Doctor Meadows</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Engine misfire puts them in the Mire</li>
<li>Tentacles seize the ship</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chapter 7: Sindy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Special Blazes takes charge and assembles Rusty Bridge&rsquo;s militia to investigate</li>
<li>Gumption is allowed to go (scene with him and Maddy) but Sindy is not and neither is Dockety</li>
<li>She and Dockety go to Bots&rsquo; End to collect Beevy and Mouse</li>
<li>The foursome gets to the Mire in time to see tentacles wrapping around the ship<ul>
<li>Steam still coming from the swamp because of the heat of re-entry</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sindy hears a male voice calling for help on the communicator in her pocket<ul>
<li>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not responding to standard protocols!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tells the militia party that there are people in the ship<ul>
<li>They all think it&rsquo;s Central</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Special Blazes thinks the voice is a trick but Mayor Lupus believes it</li>
<li>Sindy panics and yells &ldquo;No!&rdquo;<ul>
<li>Yells it into the communicator without realizing that&rsquo;s what she&rsquo;s doing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The tentacles withdraw</li>
<li>She falls to the ground unconscious from the strain</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chapter 8: Violet</h3>
<ul>
<li>Captain Lawson trying to restart the engines as the ship shakes<ul>
<li>Yelling orders through the ship&rsquo;s communicator</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Violet hears her unknown friend&rsquo;s voice yell &ldquo;No!&rdquo;<ul>
<li>Picked up by the other comms and the tentacles obey</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lawson studies the militia party through the viewer (talks to Meadows via comms)<ul>
<li>Recognize Beevy as a heavily modified defense bot</li>
<li>&ldquo;And the one with legs looks like… I don&rsquo;t know what it looks like.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They spot Sindy and feel relief that humans are here after all<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Some other ship? Or someone stayed behind after all?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Hardly seems worth taking the shuttle&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t feel like going for a swim, and it&rsquo;ll impress them&rdquo;</li>
<li>Meadows expects the &lsquo;brids will be deferential, Lawson isn&rsquo;t so confident</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>André has been injured (not badly) in all the shaking<ul>
<li>Captain Lawson wants to go alone</li>
<li>Violet says that she recognized the voice</li>
<li>He eventually gives in when Meadows says, &ldquo;You know you can&rsquo;t just leave her on the ship.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Brings Z40 and Z51 (which makes Violet uneasy)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They board the shuttle, take off, circle, and land</li>
<li>Bots leave the shuttle first</li>
<li>Immediately fired upon</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chapter 9: Sindy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sees the shuttle lift off from the downed ship, circle, and land</li>
<li>Special Blazes orders everyone away while Nash sets up a ray gun on a tripod<ul>
<li>Mayor Lupus insists that there be no shooting unless she says so</li>
<li>Blazes says &ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be time for chit-chat&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Robots disembark<ul>
<li>Blazes: &ldquo;Those are war machines!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Nash fires</li>
<li>Robots retreat instead of firing back</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lupus is furious<ul>
<li>Blazes doesn&rsquo;t apologize but is also furious at Nash for being trigger-happy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sindy is watching all this and hears Violet on the communicator<ul>
<li>She thinks about how brave Maddy was</li>
<li>Then leaves her hiding place in the trees and walks toward the shuttle</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dockety and the grown-ups yell at her to come back<ul>
<li>She tells Violet &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just afraid. You gotta show them that they got nothing to be afraid of.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Violet and Major Lawson come out<ul>
<li>Sindy gapes at her: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a throwback!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Violet (bewildered): &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what that is. I&rsquo;m human just like you.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chapter 10: Violet</h3>
<ul>
<li>Open with Violet hearing &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just afraid&rdquo;<ul>
<li>Major Lawson is listening in</li>
<li>He grimly says: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a choice. We can&rsquo;t take off again.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They go out<ul>
<li>Replay Violet and Sindy&rsquo;s &ldquo;throwback/human&rdquo; exchange</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Blazes, Lupus, and Dockety confer and then come forward<ul>
<li>Describe them through Violet&rsquo;s eyes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mayor Lupus acts as if spaceships falling out of the sky is an everyday occurrence</li>
<li>Major Lawson is cagy but eventually asks who&rsquo;s in charge<ul>
<li>Simultaneous &ldquo;I am&rdquo; from Lupus and Blazes (<em>not</em> Dockety) is clearly not an acceptable answer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lawson becomes even cagier after Dockety speaks up<ul>
<li>Clearly suspicious of free bots</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All the while, Violet and Sindy are eyeing each other</li>
<li>Conversation cut short by the tentacles reappearing</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chapter 11: Sindy</h3>
<ul>
<li>The thing with tentacles attacks the shuttle<ul>
<li>Lawson thinks that it&rsquo;s an ambush and that Dockety is responsible</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Beevy joins them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lawson grabs Sindy and pulls her onto the shuttle with Violet<ul>
<li>Z40 and Z51 cover their withdrawal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The shuttle fires on the thing with tentacles, which retreats</li>
<li>Lawson circles around as if to attack the party from Rusty Bridge<ul>
<li>Sindy screams at him not to</li>
<li>He changes course to fly over Rusty Bridge</li>
<li>Tells Doctor Meadows that they&rsquo;ve been attacked and to put the ship in defensive mode</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As they fly over Bots&rsquo; End, Crusher throws a boulder and clips the shuttle</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chapter 12: Violet</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sees Crusher throw the boulder and has a flashback to fleeing from rogue bots to reach the ship<ul>
<li>And something else: a memory of a voice while she was sleeping and dreaming (foreshadow Patient)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rock clips the shuttle</li>
<li>Lawson: &ldquo;We have to set down&rdquo;</li>
<li>Lands the shuttle in a field near an abandoned bunker<ul>
<li>Violet is afraid</li>
<li>Sindy squeezes her hand and says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, this kind of thing happens to me a lot.&rdquo;</li>
<li>But she is also afraid (flashback to encounter with Patient)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lawson, Z40, and Z51 go out to inspect the damage and their surroundings</li>
<li>Violet and Sindy talk<ul>
<li>Violet (thinking of Lawson) doesn&rsquo;t want to give too much away</li>
<li>But does reveal they&rsquo;ve been in frozen sleep for a long time</li>
<li>And that she had dreams sometimes as part of being plugged into a virtual world</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sindy tells her a bit about her encounter with Central<ul>
<li>&ldquo;I think it wanted to end. I think it wanted all the other bots to be free.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Leads to Sindy talking about how she&rsquo;s different (&ldquo;a throwback&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Which leads to her talking about Maddy (who&rsquo;s &ldquo;normal&rdquo;)<ul>
<li>Violet half-remembers encountering Maddy, but isn&rsquo;t sure it wasn&rsquo;t a dream so says nothing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lawson returns, asks Sindy if she knows anything about the bunker<ul>
<li>She warns that it might be haunted</li>
<li>Lawson scoffs, Sindy says she means by old hardware</li>
<li>Tells him a bit about Patient in Darkness</li>
<li>Lawson asks why they tolerate bots like the one that attacked the shuttle</li>
<li>Sindy bridles: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re my friends&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lawson talks to Doctor Meadows, who will try to send a drone to help repair the shuttle<ul>
<li>Lawson tells her to hurry: it won&rsquo;t be long before the locals find them</li>
<li>André makes a snarky remark about Violet in the background</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meadows asks what he&rsquo;s going to do about the girl<ul>
<li>Lawson: &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s best she stays with us for now.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chapter 13: Sindy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lawson&rsquo;s line about her staying immediately confirms her plan to escape<ul>
<li>When she said this kind of thing happens to her a lot, she didn&rsquo;t mean she <em>liked</em> it</li>
<li>Debates taking Violet with her, but doesn&rsquo;t really know her</li>
<li>Hopes there will be some old tech in the bunker she can use</li>
<li>Realizes it&rsquo;s not much of a plan</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Z-bots check out the bunker, then Lawson takes the girls<ul>
<li>Sindy casually tries to take control of Z40</li>
<li>Feels something stir, but isn&rsquo;t successful</li>
<li>Attempt triggers an alarm: Lawson thinks something in the bunker is hostile (foreshadowing)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bunker is similar enough to Patient&rsquo;s lair to give Sindy the creeps<ul>
<li>Z51 sounds an alarm</li>
<li>Lawson goes to check</li>
<li>Sindy sees her chance</li>
<li>Pulls lever</li>
<li>Violet protests, but nothing happens</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As Violet berates her, the bunker door closes and the one behind them opens</li>
<li>The bot that appears has four legs and two tentacles</li>
<li>Patient&rsquo;s voice: &ldquo;I should have known it would be you&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chapter 14: Violet</h3>
<ul>
<li>Patient&rsquo;s appearance is Violet&rsquo;s worst nightmare<ul>
<li>She wants to flee, but other bots appear with Lawson</li>
<li>Including Z40 and Z51, which have been taken over by Patient</li>
<li>Patient croons about its sleek new bodies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Villainous monologue about how it survived the demise of its bodies in Heck</li>
<li>Sindy tells it the humans it has captured are Makers<ul>
<li>Patient doesn&rsquo;t believe her</li>
<li>Believes they must be thieves who have stolen tech</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Captives are taken underground<ul>
<li>Girls are separated from Lawson</li>
<li>Violet tells Sindy about her memories of bots trying to get on the fleeing ships</li>
<li>Sindy is angry that the humans left the bots behind</li>
<li>&ldquo;And everyone else—all those people!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Violet doesn&rsquo;t believe brids are people</li>
<li>Sindy: &ldquo;My mama is a brid! And my sister, and my dad, and just about everyone I know!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Violet: &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t be! They must have adopted you or something! Brids can&rsquo;t have human children!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Argument is cut short by Mouse showing up<ul>
<li>Frightens Violet, who kicks it away</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chapter 15: Sindy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hears Violet say &ldquo;Brids can&rsquo;t have human children!&rdquo; and has a sinking feeling in her gut<ul>
<li>She has always suspected something like that</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mouse shows up, Violet kicks it away<ul>
<li>Sindy rushes over and comforts it</li>
<li>It tells her that a rescue party has found them, but the bunker is too well defended</li>
<li>Sindy tells it that Patient is back</li>
<li>Mouse is frightened but brave</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mouse gets the door open and the girls escape<ul>
<li>Violet insists on saving Captain Lawson</li>
<li>Sindy is grudgingly impressed by her bravery</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They find a lab with some chairs<ul>
<li>Captain Lawson hooked up to machines the way Sindy was in Heck</li>
<li>The screens show Captain Lawson&rsquo;s jumbled memories flashing past</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Patient&rsquo;s voice comes over the speakers<ul>
<li>It has been reviewing Captain Lawson&rsquo;s memories</li>
<li>It realizes that he and Violet really are Makers</li>
<li>And it is bitterly disappointed</li>
<li>It vows to destroy the ship and end this nonsense</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chapter 16: Violet</h3>
<ul>
<li>Patient&rsquo;s villainous monologue triggers her memories of fleeing to the ship<ul>
<li>But then she looks on the screen showing Captain Lawson&rsquo;s memories and sees the same scenes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Before she can process that, Sindy takes the chair next to Lawson and says, &ldquo;You gotta hook me up&rdquo;<ul>
<li>When Violet protests, Sindy says, &ldquo;This is how I beat it last time&rdquo; and asks if she has a better plan</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Violet: &ldquo;Yeah, I do&rdquo; and puts the helmet on her own head<ul>
<li>She recognized the helmet&rsquo;s design from the ship</li>
<li>The weight feels familiar and she wonders if she&rsquo;s remembering it from cold sleep</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She has only a few moments to unlock the doors before Patient finds her in virtual<ul>
<li>Pursuit through madcap virtual worlds reminds her of playing games with André before cold sleep</li>
<li>She sees Patient&rsquo;s plan laid out in one of the virtual rooms</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She escapes virtual and throws up on the floor<ul>
<li>Sindy helps her up: &ldquo;That was dumb. But pretty brave too.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Violet: &ldquo;We have to get out <em>now</em>.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Sindy (pointing at Lawson): &ldquo;What about your friend?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Violet: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand. We have to get back to the ship or the mad bot is going to blow it up!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
