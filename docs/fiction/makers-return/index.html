<h2>Chapter 1: My Thanks To Those I Loved (Sindy)</h2>
<p>Sindy lay in bed waiting for the sun to rise
and wishing that it wouldn&rsquo;t.
The rain had stopped an hour ago.
Raindrops made a steady plip, plip, plip outside her window
as they fell from one leaf to the next.
She hadn&rsquo;t heard the storm start,
so she must have slept,
but she still felt wearier all the way down into her bones.</p>
<p>Soft knuckles rapped gently on her door.
&ldquo;Sindy?
It&rsquo;s time to get up, love.
We don&rsquo;t want to miss this.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Yes we do,</em> she thought,
even though she knew she would never forgive herself if she did.
&ldquo;Coming, mama.&rdquo;
She pushed aside the heavy quilt she had slept under
since she was old enough to have a room of her own,
swung her legs out of the bed,
and looked at the clothes she had laid out on her chair the night before.
The gray dress was the first thing she had ever owned besides boots and underwear
that wasn&rsquo;t a hand-me-down.
She and her mother had sewn it for the trip they had planned to take to Sandy Bend.
She wished that was why she was going to wear it.</p>
<p>Papa Roo was already at the kitchen table when she went downstairs.
&ldquo;You look nice,&rdquo; he said,
holding out an arm to pull her in for a quick hug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, papa.&rdquo;
She sat and took a slice of thick, dark toast from the stack in the middle of the table
while her father poured her a cup of tea.
After waiting a few moments,
Papa Roo took Sindy&rsquo;s plate and began spreading raspberry jam on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can do that,&rdquo; Sindy said.</p>
<p>Her father nodded without stopping.
&ldquo;I know, but I like doing things for you sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mama Roo and Sindy&rsquo;s sister Maddy joined them a few minutes later.
They had brushed their fur until it almost shone,
but their expressions were solemn.
Other than a quiet, &ldquo;Pass the jam?&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo;
they ate in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can take care of those later,&rdquo; Mama Roo said
when Sindy stood to put her plate in the square tin bucket they used as a sink.
Sindy nodded,
then to her surprise found herself crying again:
not the deep sobs that had shaken her when the mayor had arrived to tell them
that Special Leaf was gone,
just raindrops spilling out of her eyes and running down her cheeks.</p>
<p>She wiped them away with her sleeve,
took a deep breath to steady herself,
and said, &ldquo;I guess we should get going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rusty Bridge wasn&rsquo;t a big town,
but it was big enough to have its own cemetery grove.
Dockety had asked if it and the other bots could help with Special Leaf&rsquo;s planting.
Mayor Lupus had thank it but shaken her head.
&ldquo;Y&rsquo;all are welcome to join us, though,&rdquo; she added.
&ldquo;He would&rsquo;ve wanted you to be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Roos arrived,
it seemed like everyone within half a day&rsquo;s walk or ride wanted to be there as well.
The Ox brothers,
Zeke Bear,
a mixed family of deer and raccoons,
a double dozen bots off to one side in a cluster around Dockety and Crucher—Sindy kept her eyes down
and let her parents and her sister respond to their murmured hellos.
She managed a &ldquo;hello&rdquo; to Gumption,
who had polished his budding horns and combed the knots out of his fur,
then took her place at her sister&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>When the sun&rsquo;s trailing edge let go of the hilltops to the east,
Mayor Lupus stepped up onto the dark rectangular stone that was the grove&rsquo;s only adornment
and rapped her gnarlywood cane on it three times.
The quiet conversations in the crowd faded,
leaving only the whisper of the wind through the branches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are gathered here today to celebrate the life of our friend, Leaf Tortoise,&rdquo;
she began,
her voice strong and clear.
Sindy stared at the ground in front of her boots
as the mayor described the years Special Leaf had spent as an Operator,
how he had helped build the school in Rusty Bridge,
and all the small kindnesses he had shown the town&rsquo;s residents over the decades.
She kept her eyes open,
because she knew that if she closed them
she would see the moment when she lost control of Special Blazes&rsquo; tech.
Everyone kept telling her it wasn&rsquo;t her fault,
especially Special Leaf,
but he had never really recovered after being burned by the fireball.</p>
<p>And now he was gone.
Peacefully,
Doc Whinny had said,
as if that made a difference.
He was gone,
and everyone in town knew she was a freak,
and Maddy was too busy making googly eyes at Gumption to play or read or,
or anything,
and—</p>
<p>As Mayor Lupus came to the end of her eulogy,
Sindy wiped her eyes with the handkerchief Mama Roo had insisted she put in the pocket of her dress.
&ldquo;That will be my thanks to those I loved
and to the world that gave me the life,&rdquo;
she mumbled along with everyone else.
At a nod from the mayor,
Zeke and one of the Ox brothers gently lowered a cotton-wrapped bundle
into the hole they had dug earlier.
The other Ox brother placed a young cedar on top of it,
and then people began shuffling forward to take turns spading in some dirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right,
them being here,&rdquo;
Miz Nabbles muttered to no one in particular
as Dockety, Beevy, and the other bots joined the line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,
Special Leaf asked for them especially,
and I think that&rsquo;s what matters most.&rdquo;
The schoolteacher&rsquo;s ears flicked back in embarrassment at Maddy&rsquo;s calm rebuke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go ahead,&rdquo;
Papa Roo said gently as they neared the head of the line.
Sindy took the shovel,
dug into the pile beside the grave,
and tilted it in.
The cedar wasn&rsquo;t even as tall as she was,
but she supposed the others towering over her must once have been as small.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miz Roo?
Could I borrow you for a moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy blinked and came back to herself
at the sound of the mayor&rsquo;s voice.
&ldquo;Um, sure,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Mayor Lupus put a hand on her elbow and steered her away from the crowd.
&ldquo;You prob&rsquo;ly want to hear this too,&rdquo;
she told Sindy&rsquo;s parents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a problem?&rdquo;
Mama Roo asked.</p>
<p>The mayor shook her head.
&ldquo;Not as such.
Here.
He wrote this before he passed,
then got Doc Whinny an&rsquo; I to witness it for him.&rdquo;
She took a piece of paper from the inside pocket of her formal black coat
and passed it to Sindy.</p>
<p>She unfolded the letter,
read it,
and then read it again.
It couldn&rsquo;t possibly mean what she thought it meant.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo;
she said helplessly.</p>
<p>The old wolf shrugged,
seeming slightly embarrassed.
&ldquo;Not much to it, really.
He left you the house an&rsquo; everything in it.
It&rsquo;s all yours now to keep or sell or whatever you want.&rdquo;
She patted her pocket.
&ldquo;I have a couple o&rsquo; keys to give you when you&rsquo;re ready for &lsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It still didn&rsquo;t make sense to Sindy.
She couldn&rsquo;t own a house—she was only twelve years old!
It was the smile on her father&rsquo;s face and the hug he gave her
that suddenly made it real.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it without him there,&rdquo;
she sniffled into his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, love,&rdquo; he said, squeezing her.
&ldquo;But until his tree grows,
being in that house is as close to him as any of us will be able to get.&rdquo;
He kissed the top her head.
&ldquo;How about we go have a look together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took them a few minutes to extricate themselves from the gathering.
Word of Special Leaf&rsquo;s bequest rippled through the crowd as they did so.
<em>At least it&rsquo;s something new for Miz Nabbles to be annoyed about,</em>
Sindy thought.</p>
<p>Gumption joined the Roos on the walk back into town.
He and Papa Roo talked for a bit about mechanical things,
and about what life was like for him as an apprentice in Sandy Bend.
When they reached Special Leaf&rsquo;s house,
he and Maddy exchanged glances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine you two would like a bit of time together,&rdquo;
Papa Roo said a little too loudly.
Maddy rolled her eyes but didn&rsquo;t let go of Gumption&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Join us for diner?&rdquo;
Mama Roo asked.
The young goat nodded,
and after giving Sindy one last hug each,
the couple walked away.</p>
<p>Papa Roo tried the door.
&ldquo;Hm—keys must be for something inside,&rdquo;
he said as it opened.
Sindy hesitated,
then swallowed the lump in her throat and followed her parents inside.</p>
<p>Special Leaf&rsquo;s front room was the closest thing Rusty Bridge had to a library.
The shelves lining the walls were packed with books.
Others lay in piles on side tables,
small slips of paper with scribbled notes tucked between their pages.
It smelled of tea, paper, soap, and the heavy wool scarves that the old tortoise had been fond of.</p>
<p>Papa Roo put his hands on his hips.
&ldquo;Well—it&rsquo;s going to take a while to sort all this out, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t have to happen today,&rdquo;
Mama Roo replied,
already sorting books into piles.
&ldquo;Sindy,
why don&rsquo;t you go and see about tea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy nodded
She had spent hours in Special Leaf&rsquo;s kitchen
practicing with the odds and ends of tech that he had collected over the years.
His temperamental kettle was a familiar adversary.</p>
<p>She filled it from the water jug,
set it to boil,
hesitated a moment,
and then took a sturdy brown case off the counter
and put it on the kitchen table.
Undoing the snaps,
she took a deep breath and lifted the lid.</p>
<p>Special Leaf&rsquo;s treasures were exactly as she had last seen them.
The strangely-shaped piece of glass that created holograms of far-off places,
the glove that Special Leaf had decided was supposed to help people learn to play the piano,
a necklace whose beads changed color at a thought:
they had spent hours together figuring out what each one did.</p>
<p>Sindy frowned and took a gray cylinder from the box.
This was new—at least,
she didn&rsquo;t remember seeing it before.
She turned it over in her hands,
but couldn&rsquo;t see anything that looked like a switch or a button.
One end had a odd texture,
like very fine sandstone,
but other than that,
the only remarkable thing about was the odd twinge
that she always felt in the back of her head
when handling any of the Makers&rsquo; ancient tech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sindy?
Where have you—oh, there you are.&rdquo;
Mama Roo joined her in the kitchen
and took the kettle off the stove.
&ldquo;Papa and I were just talking about getting lunch at the Wayside as a treat.
That would be nice, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I guess.&rdquo;
All of a sudden Sindy wanted to be anywhere but in Special Leaf&rsquo;s house without him.
&ldquo;Yeah, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;
She slipped the cylinder into her pocket as she followed her mother into the hallway,
not noticing when a little green light started blinking on its end.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2: Robots Don&rsquo;t Eat Potatoes (Violet)</h2>
<p>Violet lay in her pod waiting for the lid to open,
wishing that she was still in virtual.
The wake-up program had finished its cycle an hour ago.
Moisture made a quiet plip, plip, plip
as it dripped off the inside of the pod&rsquo;s lid.
She didn&rsquo;t remember what world she had been in,
but she was sure that being back in the real wouldn&rsquo;t be nearly as much fun.</p>
<p>She shivered despite the warmth when the lid finally hissed open.
Step one: sit up.
Step two: wait for the world to stop spinning.
Doctor Meadows said it was something to do with her inner ears,
but that didn&rsquo;t make it any better.
Step three was to grope around on the table beside her pod
to make sure her robe was there.
André had only hidden it once,
but her cheeks still burned when she thought about how embarrassed she had been.</p>
<p>She tied the robe&rsquo;s belt at her waist,
wiped her face with its sleeve,
and drained the glass of water that had been waiting beside the robe.
The artificial orange flavor made her wince,
but at least it covered up the taste of the vitamins and minerals.</p>
<p>The door to her pod room slid open.
A service bot rolled in,
one wheel squeaking slightly.
&ldquo;Good morning, Violet,&rdquo; it said cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mmph.&rdquo;
She rolled her head from side to side until something clicked in her neck.
&ldquo;Is it really morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is morning somewhere,&rdquo;
the bot replied.
&ldquo;You have a message from Doctor Meadows.
Shall I play it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;
She sat on the now-closed lid of her pod and yawned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Message begins.
Good morning, Violet.&rdquo;
Between one sentence and the next there was a soft <em>click</em>
as the bot&rsquo;s voice changed
from a generic mechanical twang to something older, warmer, and female.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morning, Doctor Meadows,&rdquo;
Violet replied dutifully.
&ldquo;How are you today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m supposed to ask you that.&rdquo;
Violet could hear the smile in the doctor&rsquo;s voice.
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the dizziness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo;
Violet yawned again.
&ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you wake me up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let Captain Leung explain that.
He&rsquo;s waiting for you on the bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>click</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey clumsy.
Trip over yourself yet or are you still in your pod?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet rolled her eyes as the bot&rsquo;s voice changed again.
&ldquo;Good morning, André.
Please tell me you had nightmares again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nightmares are for little kids,&rdquo;
the voice scoffed.
&ldquo;I was hunting dragons.
How about you?
Decorating your bedroom again?
Or making cookies?&rdquo;
He dragged the word out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;End conversation,&rdquo;
Violet told the bot wearily.
She had tried being friends with André,
and sometimes it almost seemed like it was working,
but sooner or later—usually sooner—every conversation turned to sneers and insults.
If anyone else their age was ever awake she would just block him,
but the most important word in that sentence was &ldquo;if&rdquo;.</p>
<p>At least the ark&rsquo;s showers were working.
They hadn&rsquo;t been,
once,
so she had told Doctor Meadows that she didn&rsquo;t ever want to wake up again
unless there was hot water.
She let it pummel her,
turning slowly,
and tried to remember what she had been dreaming about in virtual.
Someone had come to visit,
someone who looked like…a kangaroo?</p>
<p>She frowned and ran her fingers through her hair
to tease out the knots that somehow always formed while she slept.
There had definitely been a kangaroo,
and she had a vague sense that Central had been there too,
but she couldn&rsquo;t remember what they had said or done.
It wasn&rsquo;t important:
the people she met in virtual were never there for long.</p>
<p>Another service bot brought her clothes when she finally finished her shower.
Soft gray pants,
a matching hoodie with a built-in breathing mask in case of an emergency,
gloves for her hands and feet:
she had worn the same outfit in ever-larger sizes for as long as she could remember.
&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re older,&rdquo; Doctor Meadows and Captain Leung said
when she asked them if she could have a uniform like theirs.
She sighed,
dressed,
and headed for the bridge.</p>
<p>The corridor smelled like bleach and cinnamon.
One of the overhead lights wasn&rsquo;t working,
and she counted three—no, four—doors that were stuck half-open.
<em>Or half-closed,</em> she thought,
trying not to let the most recent signs of the ark&rsquo;s decay dampen her mood.
The bots did their best and fixed what they could,
but every time she came out of virtual,
it seemed like something new was falling apart.</p>
<p>She pushed the thought away as she climbed the ladder toward the bridge.
After one floor, she felt lighter.
After two,
she no longer needed to use her feet at all.
She paused briefly at the third floor to do a somersault,
wishing that the feeling of weightlessness still made her giggle
the way it had when she was little,
then grabbed the nearest run and continued on her way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Violet,&rdquo;
Captain Leung said as she joined him on the bridge.
&ldquo;How was your virtual?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo;
She didn&rsquo;t bother to mention the kangaroo—if it wasn&rsquo;t critical
to keeping the ark flying,
the captain wouldn&rsquo;t be interested.
&ldquo;One of the lights is out in 1-C.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded without taking his eyes off the displays in front of him.
There was more gray in his hair,
she noticed,
and judging from the smudge of beard on his cheeks
he had been awake for at least a couple of days.</p>
<p>She sat in her usual chair and buckled herself in.
&ldquo;How long was I asleep?&rdquo; she asked
after waiting a few minutes for him to say something.</p>
<p>Captain Leung glanced at one of the displays.
&ldquo;Sixteen years, twenty-nine days.
That&rsquo;s almost a new record for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yay.&rdquo;
Her stomach rumbled suddenly,
as if suddenly aware that she hadn&rsquo;t eaten in well over a decade.
&ldquo;Are André and I the only ones awake again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For now.&rdquo;
Doctor Meadows&rsquo; voice came through a speaker.
&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sorry,
but I want to keep André in isolation a little longer,
just to be safe.
His white cell count is improving, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go white cells,&rdquo;
André&rsquo;s voice said,
heavy with sarcasm.</p>
<p>Violet pouted.
It felt like ages since someone other than the captain
had been awake at the same time as her,
and he was about as much fun as the service bots.</p>
<p>She swiped her own display to bring up the exterior cameras.
The stars looked as cold and as clean as they always did.
Another swipe and she could see the blue dot where she was born.
She could zoom in if she wanted,
but what was the point?
She was going to wander the ark&rsquo;s empty corridors for a couple of days,
trade barbs with André,
say, &ldquo;Yes, Captain Leung,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Yes, Doctor Meadows,&rdquo; a few times,
and then go back into her pod,
just as she had so many times before.</p>
<p>But then Captain Leung sat back and rubbed his eyes.
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said to himself.
&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain?&rdquo; Violet asked tentatively.</p>
<p>He took a deep breath and turned to her,
forcing an unconvincing smile.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we head down to the mess and talk for a bit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes later Violet put her spoon back in her stew and said,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo;
Captain Leung said,
swallowing a mouthful of the warm beige goop the ark had made for them.
&ldquo;Our systems have suffered one minor breakdown after another,
but we&rsquo;ve always been able to patch things up.
This time, though…&rdquo;
He shook his head.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never lost contact with Central before.
I&rsquo;ve been hailing it ever since I woke up,
but it&rsquo;s not responding at all—not even a service ping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet didn&rsquo;t know what a service ping was,
but the look on Captain Leung&rsquo;s face told her how worried her was.
&ldquo;I think Central spoke to me when I was in virtual,&rdquo;
she said hesitantly.
&ldquo;I asked it to wake me up whenever there was someone new,
and…&rdquo;
She stirred her stew for a moment,
her frown matching the captain&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,
that&rsquo;s all I can remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Leung shook his head.
&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter.
I ran a full diagnostic just before you woke up,
then double-checked it.
We&rsquo;ve been leaking deuterium for years.
Just a little at a time, but it has added up.
At this rate,
we&rsquo;ll lose re-entry capability in less than a decade.
We won&rsquo;t be able to go home,&rdquo;
he explained as Violet opened her mouth to ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;
Go home?
The thought felt oddly foreign.
The ark was home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s another thing,&rdquo;
the captain continued.
&ldquo;We may have lost contact with Central,
but we&rsquo;ve picked up a comms beacon for the first time in what feels like forever.
Here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pushed his bowl aside and put a tablet on the table.
Two taps brought up a map.
&ldquo;This is our original launch site.
All this used to be farmland,
but it flooded a few hundred years ago when the river changed course.
It&rsquo;s hard to tell from this far out,
but I imagine it&rsquo;s one big swamp by now.
This, on the other hand…&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet leaned in as he swiped the map sideways.
&ldquo;This looks like a village of some sort,
and the signal is coming from right there.
See the cleared patches around it?
Those look like fields to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you think there are people there?&rdquo;
Doctor Meadows&rsquo; voice asked.</p>
<p>Captain Leung nodded.
&ldquo;Robots don&rsquo;t eat potatoes.&rdquo;
He studied the tablet a moment longer,
then looked at Violet.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we have a choice.
I think it&rsquo;s time to go home.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Chapter 3: Hide and Seek (Sindy)</h2>
<p>Sindy made a cheese and pickle sandwich to take to school the next morning,
then went back upstairs to brush her hair a second time.
Her bed was made,
and all her clothes were put away,
so as much as she wanted a reason to put off going to school,
she was fresh out.</p>
<p>She missed walking into Rusty Bridge with Maddy and Gumption.
Her big sister had stopped holding her hand years ago,
but even if they didn&rsquo;t talk much,
her company had been comforting.
Sindy hadn&rsquo;t realized how much that mattered to her until it ended.
Now,
the walk to school was just another reminder of how lonely she felt.</p>
<p>She slipped into the one-room schoolhouse
and slid into her usual seat near the back
just moments before Miz Nabbles cleared her throat and said,
&ldquo;All right, everyone, let&rsquo;s quiet down and get started, shall we?
Oh, good morning, Mister Goat—so nice of you to join us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy didn&rsquo;t looked up as Bravo Goat muttered,
&ldquo;Sorry, Miz Nabbles,&rdquo;
and plopped himself in the seat next to hers.</p>
<p>Miz Nabbles sniffed disapprovingly.
&ldquo;Will you brother be joining us today,
or does he still have—what was it this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cold, Miz Nabbles.
He&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; better, but he says he&rsquo;s still under it.&rdquo;
Bravo didn&rsquo;t even try to make the excuse convincing.</p>
<p>Someone snickered.
Miz Nabbles sniffed again.
&ldquo;Well, I suppose we&rsquo;ll just have to muddle through without him.
Now, who wants to share their answers for yesterday&rsquo;s arithmetic with the class?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused expectantly.
&ldquo;Anyone? No?
What about you, Sindy?
Do you have something for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind of,&rdquo;
she said reluctantly.
&ldquo;I did all the questions about loans and interest,
but the triggernometry—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tri<em>go</em>nometry,&rdquo; Miz Nabbles corrected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;—tri<em>go</em>nometry was really hard.
I didn&rsquo;t even really know how to start,&rdquo;
Sindy confessed.</p>
<p>Miz Nabbles flicked her tail.
&ldquo;Well, we went over it <em>twice</em> in class.
It really shouldn&rsquo;t be that difficult,
particularly not for someone with your special abilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy&rsquo;s ears burned.
<em>Just &lsquo;cuz I can use tech doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m good at math,</em>
she thought but didn&rsquo;t say.
She actually had been able to do most of the problems,
but when she had shown up last week with all her homework done,
some of the other kids had called her a show-off.
Sometimes it seemed like there were no right answers.</p>
<p>Recess came exactly an hour and a half later.
She pretended to be writing a note in her practice book
until most of her classmates had poured out the door into the playground,
then followed them.
Bravo and some other boys her age had found long sticks
and were practicing the pike drills
they had seen the town&rsquo;s militia do.
Melia Fox and two other girls were skipping rope—Sindy knew
she wouldn&rsquo;t be welcome there—but
a few of the younger children seemed to be organizing a game of freeze tag.</p>
<p>She stood and waited on the edge of the group
while they settled on the precise rules.
After ignoring her for a few moments,
Melia&rsquo;s younger sister glanced at her.
&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; she said insincerely,
&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve got too many people already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy waited just long enough for the moment to become uncomfortable
before saying,
&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo;
and turning away.
Feeling more alone than ever,
she walked slowly over to the toybox,
took out three cloth balls,
and started to practice juggling,
just like she had every day last week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault,&rdquo; she wanted to say,
except she didn&rsquo;t know who she would say it to.
It wasn&rsquo;t her fault that she was a throwback.
(&ldquo;Original,&rdquo; she heard Maddy correct her in her head.
&ldquo;The word is &lsquo;original&rsquo;.&rdquo;)
It wasn&rsquo;t her fault that the Operators had kidnapped her
and tried to hand her over to the bots in Heck.
(But the sidelong looks when she went into town told her
exactly who was thinking that there had to have been a reason.)
It wasn&rsquo;t her fault that Special Leaf had died.
(But he wouldn&rsquo;t have been injured if she hadn&rsquo;t lost control,
and no matter what Doc Whinny and Mayor Lupus and everyone said,
that <em>had</em> to have weakened him.)</p>
<p>Miz Nabbles set them free at noon.
Sindy didn&rsquo;t bother to try to find someone to sit with for lunch.
Instead,
she took the shortcut between the lumber yard and Ox brothers&rsquo; brewery
to the dirt road that led out of town.
She ate her sandwich as she walked,
wishing with every dry mouthful that she had brought a water bottle as well.</p>
<p>She needed a hobby, she decided,
kicking a loose stone into the knee-high weeds at the side of the road.
Maddy had her drawing and Gumption was learning to be a mechanic—she
should find something she could do on her own
that <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> involve the Makers&rsquo; ancient tech.
She had tried sewing and baking and singing and whittling and now juggling,
but nothing ever held her interest more than a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Sindy kicked another rock into the weeds
and tossed the last crust of her sandwich over her shoulder for luck.
At least the bots would be happy to see her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,
Sindy.
I have promised to repair the Foxes&rsquo; cart by sundown.
Perhaps we can play tag some other time.&rdquo;
The buzzing undertone of Dockety&rsquo;s voice hadn&rsquo;t changed,
but Sindy still wasn&rsquo;t used to the bot referring to itself as &ldquo;I&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; she said,
trying to to keep the disappointment out of her voice.
Dockety&rsquo;s eyes rotated and rotated back in its equivalent of either a shrug or a smile,
she was never sure which.
It turned back to the cart in question,
the back end of which was resting on a tree stump
while the bot mended its rear axle.</p>
<p>Crusher and Beevy were busy turning logs into planks,
not that either would been much fun to play tag with.
She didn&rsquo;t really know any of the other bots she could see
well enough to ask them to play.
<em>I should have just gone home,</em>
she thought,
then jumped and squeaked as something pinched her ankle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gotcha tee hee hee,&rdquo;
said a deep voice.
The same words scrolled across the screen
on the front of the little bot that had rolled up behind her.</p>
<p>Sindy put her hands on her hips and scowled down at it.
&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t funny, Mouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was too.&rdquo;
The little bot flashed a pattern of sparkles on its screen.
It zipped back and forth,
pleased with itself.</p>
<p>Sindy rolled her eyes.
&ldquo;Fine.
Maybe it was a little funny.
Hey,
do you want to play tag?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took her a minute to explain the rules.
&ldquo;You can be &lsquo;it&rsquo; first,&rdquo; she finished.
&ldquo;Ready?
Hey!&rdquo;
She yelped as Mouse poked her with its single skinny arm
and immediately raced away,
its four wheels bouncing over the stones and potholes of Bots&rsquo; End&rsquo;s single short street.</p>
<p>She gave chase,
only for the little bot to disappear under the raised floor of a nearby building.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not fair! Come back out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope.
Tee hee hee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy crouched down.
She could see sparkles of amusement on Mouse&rsquo;s screen,
but she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to reach it unless she lay down and got dirt all over her dress.
Even if she did,
the bot could just roll back.</p>
<p>She sat back on her haunches.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not you play tag, Mouse,&rdquo; she repeated.
&ldquo;You have to be somewhere the other person <em>could</em> catch you or it&rsquo;s no fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence,
and then then Mouse rolled out from under the building.
<code>you didn't say that was a rule</code> scrolled accusingly across its screen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;
Sindy had played with Mouse often enough to know that
not using its voice was its way of showing its feelings were hurt.
&ldquo;How about we try again some other time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her mood and the sky darkened in time with each other as she walked home.
The first few drops of rain began to spatter around her
just as she reached her front door.
&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; she said in answer to her father&rsquo;s question about how school had been.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do homework.&rdquo;
She trudged up the stairs without waiting for a response,
closed the door behind her,
and flopped on her bed.</p>
<p>Staring at the ceiling didn&rsquo;t make her feel any better.
Neither did re-doing the braid in her hair,
and the books sitting on her side table
just reminded her of Special Leaf.
Papa Roo would play checkers with her if she asked him to,
but she hated it when people did things because they felt sorry for her.</p>
<p>She picked up the little gray cylinder she had found in Special Leaf&rsquo;s house
and frowned at the little green light blinking on one end.
It hadn&rsquo;t been doing that yesterday, had it?
She turned it over,
looking for a button or switch or anything else.
&ldquo;So what do you do?&rdquo; she asked out loud.</p>
<p>And froze as an unknown voice responded,
&ldquo;What do you mean, what do I do?&rdquo;</p>
