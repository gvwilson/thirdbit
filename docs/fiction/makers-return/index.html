<h1>The Makers Return</h1>



<ul>
<li>Final book in the trilogy</li>
<li>Will be a good opportunity for me to practice endings</li>
<li>Major points</li>
<li>The last of the Makers&rsquo; ships returns</li>
<li>Only a couple of adults have survived: the other passengers are all children</li>
<li>They think bots and &ldquo;brids&rdquo; (hybrids) are meant to serve them</li>
<li>Blazes and other hard-line Operators want to go to war</li>
<li>The bots are split as well: form an uneasy alliance with the Operators</li>
<li>A child from each side must work together to prevent war</li>
<li>Story is told from two points of view</li>
<li>Sindy has never felt like she fits in</li>
<li>Violet&rsquo;s whole world is gone</li>
<li>But Violet has spoken with several imprisoned brids over the years<ul>
<li>Refer back to &ldquo;In Heck&rdquo; encounter with Maddy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sindy: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not one of them (meaning hybrids), but I&rsquo;m not one of you either (meaning human).&rdquo;</li>
<li>Violet (later, to the adult humans): &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not one of them (meaning hybrids), but I&rsquo;m not one of you any more.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Big bang at the end</li>
<li>Patient restores itself from a backup copy</li>
<li>Is furious that the Makers aren&rsquo;t what it expected</li>
<li>So it wants to blow up their ship (and the whole valley with it)</li>
<li>Sindy and Violet are the only ones who realize it is back</li>

<li>André is awake as well (they spar out of habit)</li>
<li>Violet asks &ldquo;What about the others?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Captain Lawson: &ldquo;not yet&rdquo;</li>
<li>He is worried by the lack of response to their hails and the degraded infrastructure</li>
<li>But systems are failing: they have to land</li>
<li>What was farmland near the launch paid is now a swamp</li>
<li>But there is a signal coming from a small town near it (ref. to Sindy&rsquo;s beacon)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chapter 3: Sindy<ul>
<li>Sindy is back in Miz Nabbles&rsquo; classroom feeling more isolated than ever</li>
<li>Miz Nabbles picks on her a bit in class</li>
<li>Other kids make a point of not inviting her to play hide and seek</li>
<li>She wishes she had a hobby like Maddy&rsquo;s drawing or Gumption&rsquo;s mechanics</li>
<li>She goes to visit Mouse in Bots&rsquo; End</li>
<li>The little bot is excited to finally have a voice (but still uses its screen as well)</li>
<li>She tries to play hide and seek with it, but the game doesn&rsquo;t work</li>
<li>Goes home, disconsolate</li>
<li>In her room, talks to herself, is surprised when the communicator answers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chapter 4: Violet<ul>
<li>Doctor Meadows and Captain Lawson are making preparations for landing</li>
<li>Takes a while to check out all the systems, many of which are damaged</li>
<li>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been asleep a lot longer than we planned&rdquo; (but never specify exactly how long)</li>
<li>Violet is bored, but every time she tries to play with André it ends in squabbling</li>
<li>Mirrors the isolation that Sindy feels</li>
<li>André retreats to the virtual world they had access to while they were in cryo</li>
<li>Violet has had enough of that</li>
<li>Remembers meeting hybrids, but they were all upset or bewildered</li>
<li>Doctor Meadows clearly knows they were real, but is uncomfortable discussing it</li>
<li>Wakes up in the middle of the &ldquo;night&rdquo; and goes and sits in the captain&rsquo;s chair to play make-believe</li>
<li>Hears Sindy&rsquo;s voice</li>
<li>Starts a conversation and only belatedly realizes she&rsquo;s <em>not</em> talking to the computer</li>
<li>Tells Sindy that they&rsquo;re going to land the next day</li>
<li>Captain Lawson comes in and turns off the comms (angry)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chapter 5: Sindy<ul>
<li>Tries to get people to believe that the star is a ship and is coming</li>
<li>Bluster and Bravo make fun of her</li>
<li>Everyone is distracted by the arrival of Special Blazes and his new partner Nash</li>
<li>Tense scenes with the mayor and the bots (Dockety and Beevy)</li>
<li>Then the ship starts to come down in a ball of fire</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chapter 6: Violet<ul>
<li>Describe the landing from her point of view</li>
<li>A moment when she and André are both frightened and he&rsquo;s <em>not</em> a jerk</li>
<li>Engine misfire puts them in the Mire</li>
<li>Tentacles seize the ship</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chapter 7: Sindy<ul>
<li>Special Blazes takes charge and assembles Rusty Bridge&rsquo;s militia to investigate</li>
<li>Gumption is allowed to go (scene with him and Maddy) but Sindy is not and neither is Dockety</li>
<li>She and Dockety go to Bots&rsquo; End to collect Beevy and Mouse</li>
<li>The foursome gets to the Mire in time to see tentacles wrapping around the ship</li>
<li>Steam still coming from the swamp because of the heat of re-entry</li>
<li>Sindy hears a male voice calling for help on the communicator in her pocket</li>
<li>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not responding to standard protocols!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Tells the militia party that there are people in the ship</li>
<li>They all think it&rsquo;s Central</li>
<li>Special Blazes thinks the voice is a trick but Mayor Lupus believes it</li>
<li>Sindy panics and yells &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Yells it into the communicator without realizing that&rsquo;s what she&rsquo;s doing</li>
<li>The tentacles withdraw</li>
<li>She falls to the ground unconscious</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chapter 8: Violet<ul>
<li>Captain Lawson trying to restart the engines as the ship shakes</li>
<li>Yelling orders through the ship&rsquo;s communicator</li>
<li>Violet hears her unknown friend&rsquo;s voice yell &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Picked up by the other comms and the tentacles obey</li>
<li>Lawson and Meadows study the militia party through the viewer</li>
<li>Recognize Beevy as a heavily modified defense bot</li>
<li>&ldquo;And the one with legs looks like… I don&rsquo;t know what it looks like.&rdquo;</li>
<li>They spot Sindy and feel relief that humans are here after all</li>
<li>&ldquo;Some other ship? Or someone stayed behind after all?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Hardly seems worth taking the shuttle&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t feel like going for a swim, and it&rsquo;ll impress them&rdquo;</li>
<li>Meadows expects the &lsquo;brids to be deferential, Lawson isn&rsquo;t so confident</li>
<li>André has been injured (not badly) in all the shaking</li>
<li>Captain Lawson wants to go alone</li>
<li>Violet says that she recognized the voice</li>
<li>He eventually gives in (feels they&rsquo;ll look less threatening)</li>
<li>Brings Z40 and Z44 (which makes Violet uneasy)</li>
<li>They board the shuttle, take off, circle, and land</li>
<li>Bots leave the shuttle first</li>
<li>Immediately fired upon</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chapter 9: Sindy<ul>
<li>Sees the shuttle lift off from the downed ship, circle, and land</li>
<li>Special Blazes orders everyone away while Nash sets up a ray gun on a tripod</li>
<li>Mayor Lupus insists that there be no shooting unless she says so</li>
<li>Blazes says &ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be time for chit-chat&rdquo;</li>
<li>Robots disembark</li>
<li>Blazes: &ldquo;Those are war machines!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Nash fires</li>
<li>Robots retreat instead of firing back</li>
<li>Lupus is furious</li>
<li>Blazes doesn&rsquo;t apologize but is also furious at Nash for being trigger-happy</li>
<li>Sindy is watching all this and hears Violet on the communicator</li>
<li>She thinks about how brave Maddy was</li>
<li>Then leaves her hiding place in the trees and walks toward the shuttle</li>
<li>Dockety and the grown-ups yell at her to come back</li>
<li>She tells Violet &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just afraid. You gotta show them that they got nothing to be afraid of.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Violet and Major Lawson come out</li>
<li>Sindy gapes at her: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a throwback!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Violet (bewildered): &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what that is. I&rsquo;m human just like you.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chapter 10: Violet<ul>
<li>Open with Violet hearing &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just afraid&rdquo;</li>
<li>Major Lawson is listening in</li>
<li>He grimly says: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a choice. We can&rsquo;t take off again.&rdquo;</li>
<li>They go out</li>
<li>Replay Violet and Sindy&rsquo;s &ldquo;throwback/human&rdquo; exchange</li>
<li>Blazes, Lupus, and Dockety confer and then come forward</li>
<li>Describe them through Violet&rsquo;s eyes</li>
<li>Mayor Lupus acts as if spaceships falling out of the sky is an everyday occurrence</li>
<li>Major Lawson is cagy but eventually asks who&rsquo;s in charge</li>
<li>Simultaneous &ldquo;I am&rdquo; from Lupus and Blazes (<em>not</em> Dockety) is clearly not an acceptable answer</li>
<li>Lawson becomes even cagier after Dockety speaks up</li>
<li>Clearly suspicious of free bots</li>
<li>All the while, Violet and Sindy are eyeing each other</li>
<li>Conversation cut short by the tentacles reappearing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chapter 11: Sindy<ul>
<li>The thing with tentacles attacks the shuttle</li>
<li>Lawson thinks that it&rsquo;s an ambush and that Dockety is responsible</li>
<li>Z40 and Z44 reappear and do battle with the tentacles</li>
<li>Beevy joins them</li>
<li>Lawson grabs Sindy and pulls her onto the shuttle with Violet</li>
<li>Z40 and Z44 cover their withdrawal</li>
<li>The shuttle fires on the thing with tentacles, which retreats</li>
<li>Lawson circles around as if to attack the party from Rusty Bridge</li>
<li>Sindy screams at him not to</li>
<li>He changes course to fly over Rusty Bridge</li>
<li>Tells Doctor Meadows that they&rsquo;ve been attacked and to put the ship in defensive mode</li>
<li>As they fly over Bots&rsquo; End, Crusher throws a boulder and clips the shuttle</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chapter 12: Violet<ul>
<li>Sees Crusher throw the boulder and has a flashback to fleeing from rogue bots to reach the ship</li>
<li>And something else: a memory of a voice while she was sleeping and dreaming (foreshadow Patient)</li>
<li>Rock clips the shuttle</li>
<li>Lawson: &ldquo;We have to set down&rdquo;</li>
<li>Lands the shuttle in a field near a small abandoned farmhouse</li>
<li>Violet is afraid</li>
<li>Sindy squeezes her hand and says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, this kind of thing happens to me a lot.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Lawson, Z40, and Z44 go out to inspect the damage and their surroundings</li>
<li>Violet and Sindy talk</li>
<li>Violet (thinking of Lawson) doesn&rsquo;t want to give too much away</li>
<li>But does reveal they&rsquo;ve been in frozen sleep for a long time</li>
<li>And that she had dreams sometimes as part of being plugged into a virtual world</li>
<li>Sindy tells her a bit about her encounter with Central</li>
<li>&ldquo;I think it wanted to end. I think it wanted all the other bots to be free.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Leads to Sindy talking about how she&rsquo;s different (&ldquo;a throwback&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Which leads to her talking about Maddy (who&rsquo;s &ldquo;normal&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Violet half-remembers encountering Maddy, but isn&rsquo;t sure it wasn&rsquo;t a dream so says nothing</li>
<li>Lawson returns, asks Sindy if she knows anything about the farmhouse</li>
<li>Sindy doesn&rsquo;t know anything specific, just that there are places that didn&rsquo;t work out</li>
<li>Sometimes the soil won&rsquo;t grow stuff, sometimes raiders, sometimes just bad luck</li>
<li>She warns that it might be haunted</li>
<li>Lawson scoffs, Sindy says she means by old hardware</li>
<li>Lawson talks to Doctor Meadows, who will try to send a drone to help repair the shuttle</li>
<li>Lawson tells her to hurry: it won&rsquo;t be long before the locals find them</li>
<li>Meadows asks what he&rsquo;s going to do about the girl</li>
<li>Lawson looks at Sindy and says, &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be safer here for now.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chapter 13: Sindy</li>
<li>Chapter 14: Violet</li>
<li>Chapter 15: Sindy</li>
<li>Chapter 16: Violet</li>
<li>Chapter 17: Sindy</li>
<li>Chapter 18: Violet</li>
<li>Chapter 19: Violet</li>
<li>Chapter 20: Violet</li>
<li>Epilog<ul>
<li>Dockety takes what&rsquo;s left of Patient to the Tailor for mending</li>
<li>And the remaining children are woken up into a strange new world</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
