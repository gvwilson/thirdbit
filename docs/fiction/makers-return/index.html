<h2>Chapter 1: My Thanks To Those I Loved (Sindy)</h2>
<p>Sindy lay in bed waiting for the sun to rise
and wishing that it wouldn&rsquo;t.
The rain had stopped an hour ago.
Raindrops made a steady plip, plip, plip outside her window
as they fell from one leaf to the next.
She hadn&rsquo;t heard the storm start,
so she must have slept,
but she still felt wearier all the way down into her bones.</p>
<p>Soft knuckles rapped gently on her door.
&ldquo;Sindy?
It&rsquo;s time to get up, love.
We don&rsquo;t want to miss this.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Yes we do,</em> she thought,
even though she knew she would never forgive herself if she did.
&ldquo;Coming, mama.&rdquo;
She pushed aside the heavy quilt she had slept under
since she was old enough to have a room of her own,
swung her legs out of the bed,
and looked at the clothes she had laid out on her chair the night before.
The gray dress was the first thing she had ever owned besides boots and underwear
that wasn&rsquo;t a hand-me-down.
She and her mother had sewn it for the trip they had planned to take to Sandy Bend.
She wished that was why she was going to wear it.</p>
<p>Papa Roo was already at the kitchen table when she went downstairs.
&ldquo;You look nice,&rdquo; he said,
holding out an arm to pull her in for a quick hug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, papa.&rdquo;
She sat and took a slice of thick, dark toast from the stack in the middle of the table
while her father poured her a cup of tea.
After waiting a few moments,
Papa Roo took Sindy&rsquo;s plate and began spreading raspberry jam on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can do that,&rdquo; Sindy said.</p>
<p>Her father nodded without stopping.
&ldquo;I know, but I like doing things for you sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mama Roo and Sindy&rsquo;s sister Maddy joined them a few minutes later.
They had brushed their fur until it almost shone,
but their expressions were solemn.
Other than a quiet, &ldquo;Pass the jam?&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo;
they ate in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can take care of those later,&rdquo; Mama Roo said
when Sindy stood to put her plate in the square tin bucket they used as a sink.
Sindy nodded,
then to her surprise found herself crying again:
not the deep sobs that had shaken her when the mayor had arrived to tell them
that Special Leaf was gone,
just raindrops spilling out of her eyes and running down her cheeks.</p>
<p>She wiped them away with her sleeve,
took a deep breath to steady herself,
and said, &ldquo;I guess we should get going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rusty Bridge wasn&rsquo;t a big town,
but it was big enough to have its own cemetery grove.
Dockety had asked if it and the other bots could help with Special Leaf&rsquo;s planting.
Mayor Lupus had thank it but shaken her head.
&ldquo;Y&rsquo;all are welcome to join us, though,&rdquo; she added.
&ldquo;He would&rsquo;ve wanted you to be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Roos arrived,
it seemed like everyone within half a day&rsquo;s walk or ride wanted to be there as well.
The Ox brothers,
Zeke Bear,
a mixed family of deer and raccoons,
a double dozen bots off to one side in a cluster around Dockety and Crucher—Sindy kept her eyes down
and let her parents and her sister respond to their murmured hellos.
She managed a &ldquo;hello&rdquo; to Gumption,
who had polished his budding horns and combed the knots out of his fur,
then took her place at her sister&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>When the sun&rsquo;s trailing edge let go of the hilltops to the east,
Mayor Lupus stepped up onto the dark rectangular stone that was the grove&rsquo;s only adornment
and rapped her gnarlywood cane on it three times.
The quiet conversations in the crowd faded,
leaving only the whisper of the wind through the branches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are gathered here today to celebrate the life of our friend, Leaf Tortoise,&rdquo;
she began,
her voice strong and clear.
Sindy stared at the ground in front of her boots
as the mayor described the years Special Leaf had spent as an Operator,
how he had helped build the school in Rusty Bridge,
and all the small kindnesses he had shown the town&rsquo;s residents over the decades.
She kept her eyes open,
because she knew that if she closed them
she would see the moment when she lost control of Special Blazes&rsquo; tech.
Everyone kept telling her it wasn&rsquo;t her fault,
especially Special Leaf,
but he had never really recovered after being burned by the fireball.</p>
<p>And now he was gone.
Peacefully,
Doc Whinny had said,
as if that made a difference.
He was gone,
and everyone in town knew she was a freak,
and Maddy was too busy making googly eyes at Gumption to play or read or,
or anything,
and—</p>
<p>As Mayor Lupus came to the end of her eulogy,
Sindy wiped her eyes with the handkerchief Mama Roo had insisted she put in the pocket of her dress.
&ldquo;That will be my thanks to those I loved
and to the world that gave me the life,&rdquo;
she mumbled along with everyone else.
At a nod from the mayor,
Zeke and one of the Ox brothers gently lowered a cotton-wrapped bundle
into the hole they had dug earlier.
The other Ox brother placed a young cedar on top of it,
and then people began shuffling forward to take turns spading in some dirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right,
them being here,&rdquo;
Miz Nabbles muttered to no one in particular
as Dockety, Beevy, and the other bots joined the line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,
Special Leaf asked for them especially,
and I think that&rsquo;s what matters most.&rdquo;
The schoolteacher&rsquo;s ears flicked back in embarrassment at Maddy&rsquo;s calm rebuke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go ahead,&rdquo;
Papa Roo said gently as they neared the head of the line.
Sindy took the shovel,
dug into the pile beside the grave,
and tilted it in.
The cedar wasn&rsquo;t even as tall as she was,
but she supposed the others towering over her must once have been as small.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miz Roo?
Could I borrow you for a moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy blinked and came back to herself
at the sound of the mayor&rsquo;s voice.
&ldquo;Um, sure,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Mayor Lupus put a hand on her elbow and steered her away from the crowd.
&ldquo;You prob&rsquo;ly want to hear this too,&rdquo;
she told Sindy&rsquo;s parents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a problem?&rdquo;
Mama Roo asked.</p>
<p>The mayor shook her head.
&ldquo;Not as such.
Here.
He wrote this before he passed,
then got Doc Whinny an&rsquo; I to witness it for him.&rdquo;
She took a piece of paper from the inside pocket of her formal black coat
and passed it to Sindy.</p>
<p>She unfolded the letter,
read it,
and then read it again.
It couldn&rsquo;t possibly mean what she thought it meant.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo;
she said helplessly.</p>
<p>The old wolf shrugged,
seeming slightly embarrassed.
&ldquo;Not much to it, really.
He left you the house an&rsquo; everything in it.
It&rsquo;s all yours now to keep or sell or whatever you want.&rdquo;
She patted her pocket.
&ldquo;I have a couple o&rsquo; keys to give you when you&rsquo;re ready for &lsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It still didn&rsquo;t make sense to Sindy.
She couldn&rsquo;t own a house—she was only twelve years old!
It was the smile on her father&rsquo;s face and the hug he gave her
that suddenly made it real.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it without him there,&rdquo;
she sniffled into his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, love,&rdquo; he said, squeezing her.
&ldquo;But until his tree grows,
being in that house is as close to him as any of us will be able to get.&rdquo;
He kissed the top her head.
&ldquo;How about we go have a look together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took them a few minutes to extricate themselves from the gathering.
Word of Special Leaf&rsquo;s bequest rippled through the crowd as they did so.
<em>At least it&rsquo;s something new for Miz Nabbles to be annoyed about,</em>
Sindy thought.</p>
<p>Gumption joined the Roos on the walk back into town.
He and Papa Roo talked for a bit about mechanical things,
and about what life was like for him as an apprentice in Sandy Bend.
When they reached Special Leaf&rsquo;s house,
he and Maddy exchanged glances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine you two would like a bit of time together,&rdquo;
Papa Roo said a little too loudly.
Maddy rolled her eyes but didn&rsquo;t let go of Gumption&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Join us for diner?&rdquo;
Mama Roo asked.
The young goat nodded,
and after giving Sindy one last hug each,
the couple walked away.</p>
<p>Papa Roo tried the door.
&ldquo;Hm—keys must be for something inside,&rdquo;
he said as it opened.
Sindy hesitated,
then swallowed the lump in her throat and followed her parents inside.</p>
<p>Special Leaf&rsquo;s front room was the closest thing Rusty Bridge had to a library.
The shelves lining the walls were packed with books.
Others lay in piles on side tables,
small slips of paper with scribbled notes tucked between their pages.
It smelled of tea, paper, soap, and the heavy wool scarves that the old tortoise had been fond of.</p>
<p>Papa Roo put his hands on his hips.
&ldquo;Well—it&rsquo;s going to take a while to sort all this out, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t have to happen today,&rdquo;
Mama Roo replied,
already sorting books into piles.
&ldquo;Sindy,
why don&rsquo;t you go and see about tea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy nodded
She had spent hours in Special Leaf&rsquo;s kitchen
practicing with the odds and ends of tech that he had collected over the years.
His temperamental kettle was a familiar adversary.</p>
<p>She filled it from the water jug,
set it to boil,
hesitated a moment,
and then took a sturdy brown case off the counter
and put it on the kitchen table.
Undoing the snaps,
she took a deep breath and lifted the lid.</p>
<p>Special Leaf&rsquo;s treasures were exactly as she had last seen them.
The strangely-shaped piece of glass that created holograms of far-off places,
the glove that Special Leaf had decided was supposed to help people learn to play the piano,
a necklace whose beads changed color at a thought:
they had spent hours together figuring out what each one did.</p>
<p>Sindy frowned and took a gray cylinder from the box.
This was new—at least,
she didn&rsquo;t remember seeing it before.
She turned it over in her hands,
but couldn&rsquo;t see anything that looked like a switch or a button.
One end had a odd texture,
like very fine sandstone,
but other than that,
the only remarkable thing about was the odd twinge
that she always felt in the back of her head
when handling any of the Makers&rsquo; ancient tech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sindy?
Where have you—oh, there you are.&rdquo;
Mama Roo joined her in the kitchen
and took the kettle off the stove.
&ldquo;Papa and I were just talking about getting lunch at the Wayside as a treat.
That would be nice, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I guess.&rdquo;
All of a sudden Sindy wanted to be anywhere but in Special Leaf&rsquo;s house without him.
&ldquo;Yeah, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;
She slipped the cylinder into her pocket as she followed her mother into the hallway,
not noticing when a little green light started blinking on its end.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2: Robots Don&rsquo;t Eat Potatoes (Violet)</h2>
<p>Violet lay in her pod waiting for the lid to open,
wishing that she was still in virtual.
The wake-up program had finished its cycle an hour ago.
Moisture made a quiet plip, plip, plip
as it dripped off the inside of the pod&rsquo;s lid.
She didn&rsquo;t remember what world she had been in,
but she was sure that being back in the real wouldn&rsquo;t be nearly as much fun.</p>
<p>She shivered despite the warmth when the lid finally hissed open.
Step one: sit up.
Step two: wait for the world to stop spinning.
Doctor Szego said it was something to do with her inner ears,
but that didn&rsquo;t make it any better.
Step three was to grope around on the table beside her pod
to make sure her robe was there.
André had only hidden it once,
but her cheeks still burned when she thought about how embarrassed she had been.</p>
<p>She tied the robe&rsquo;s belt at her waist,
wiped her face with its sleeve,
and drained the glass of water that had been waiting beside the robe.
The artificial orange flavor made her wince,
but at least it covered up the taste of the vitamins and minerals.</p>
<p>The door to her pod room slid open.
A service bot rolled in,
one wheel squeaking slightly.
&ldquo;Good morning, Violet,&rdquo; it said cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mmph.&rdquo;
She rolled her head from side to side until something clicked in her neck.
&ldquo;Is it really morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is morning somewhere,&rdquo;
the bot replied.
&ldquo;You have a message from Doctor Szego.
Shall I play it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;
She sat on the now-closed lid of her pod and yawned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Message begins.
Good morning, Violet.&rdquo;
Between one sentence and the next there was a soft <em>click</em>
as the bot&rsquo;s voice changed
from a generic mechanical twang to something older, warmer, and female.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morning, Doctor Szego,&rdquo;
Violet replied dutifully.
&ldquo;How are you today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m supposed to ask you that.&rdquo;
Violet could hear the smile in the doctor&rsquo;s voice.
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the dizziness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo;
Violet yawned again.
&ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you wake me up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let Captain Leung explain that.
He&rsquo;s waiting for you on the bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>click</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey clumsy.
Trip over yourself yet or are you still in your pod?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet rolled her eyes as the bot&rsquo;s voice changed again.
&ldquo;Good morning, André.
Please tell me you had nightmares again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nightmares are for little kids,&rdquo;
the voice scoffed.
&ldquo;I was hunting dragons.
How about you?
Decorating your bedroom again?
Or making cookies?&rdquo;
He dragged the word out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;End conversation,&rdquo;
Violet told the bot wearily.
She had tried being friends with André,
and sometimes it almost seemed like it was working,
but sooner or later—usually sooner—every conversation turned to sneers and insults.
If anyone else their age was ever awake she would just block him,
but the most important word in that sentence was &ldquo;if&rdquo;.</p>
<p>At least the ark&rsquo;s showers were working.
They hadn&rsquo;t been,
once,
so she had told Doctor Szego that she didn&rsquo;t ever want to wake up again
unless there was hot water.
She let it pummel her,
turning slowly,
and tried to remember what she had been dreaming about in virtual.
Someone had come to visit,
someone who looked like…a kangaroo?</p>
<p>She frowned and ran her fingers through her purple hair
to tease out the knots that somehow always formed while she slept.
There had definitely been a kangaroo,
and she had a vague sense that Central had been there too,
but she couldn&rsquo;t remember what they had said or done.
It wasn&rsquo;t important:
the people she met in virtual were never there for long.</p>
<p>Another service bot brought her clothes when she finally finished her shower.
Soft gray pants,
a matching hoodie with a built-in breathing mask in case of an emergency,
gloves for her hands and feet:
she had worn the same outfit in ever-larger sizes for as long as she could remember.
&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re older,&rdquo; Doctor Szego and Captain Leung said
when she asked them if she could have a uniform like theirs.
She sighed,
dressed,
and headed for the bridge.</p>
<p>The corridor smelled like bleach and cinnamon.
One of the overhead lights wasn&rsquo;t working,
and she counted three—no, four—doors that were stuck half-open.
<em>Or half-closed,</em> she thought,
trying not to let the most recent signs of the ark&rsquo;s decay dampen her mood.
The bots did their best and fixed what they could,
but every time she came out of virtual,
it seemed like something new was falling apart.</p>
<p>She pushed the thought away as she climbed the ladder toward the bridge.
After one floor, she felt lighter.
After two,
she no longer needed to use her feet at all.
She paused briefly at the third floor to do a somersault,
wishing that the feeling of weightlessness still made her giggle
the way it had when she was little,
then grabbed the nearest run and continued on her way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Violet,&rdquo;
Captain Leung said as she joined him on the bridge.
&ldquo;How was your virtual?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo;
She didn&rsquo;t bother to mention the kangaroo—if it wasn&rsquo;t critical
to keeping the ark flying,
the captain wouldn&rsquo;t be interested.
&ldquo;One of the lights is out in 1-C.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded without taking his eyes off the displays in front of him.
There was more gray in his hair,
she noticed,
and judging from the smudge of beard on his cheeks
he had been awake for at least a couple of days.</p>
<p>She sat in her usual chair and buckled herself in.
&ldquo;How long was I asleep?&rdquo; she asked
after waiting a few minutes for him to say something.</p>
<p>Captain Leung glanced at one of the displays.
&ldquo;Sixteen years, twenty-nine days.
That&rsquo;s almost a new record for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yay.&rdquo;
Her stomach rumbled suddenly,
as if suddenly aware that she hadn&rsquo;t eaten in well over a decade.
&ldquo;Are André and I the only ones awake again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For now.&rdquo;
Doctor Szego&rsquo; voice came through a speaker.
&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sorry,
but I want to keep André in isolation a little longer,
just to be safe.
His white cell count is improving, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go white cells,&rdquo;
André&rsquo;s voice said,
heavy with sarcasm.</p>
<p>Violet pouted.
It felt like ages since someone other than the captain
had been awake at the same time as her,
and he was about as much fun as the service bots.</p>
<p>She swiped her own display to bring up the exterior cameras.
The stars looked as cold and as clean as they always did.
Another swipe and she could see the blue dot where she was born.
She could zoom in if she wanted,
but what was the point?
She was going to wander the ark&rsquo;s empty corridors for a couple of days,
trade barbs with André,
say, &ldquo;Yes, Captain Leung,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Yes, Doctor Szego,&rdquo; a few times,
and then go back into her pod,
just as she had so many times before.</p>
<p>But then Captain Leung sat back and rubbed his eyes.
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said to himself.
&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain?&rdquo; Violet asked tentatively.</p>
<p>He took a deep breath and turned to her,
forcing an unconvincing smile.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we head down to the mess and talk for a bit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes later Violet put her spoon back in her stew and said,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo;
Captain Leung said,
swallowing a mouthful of the warm beige goop the ark had made for them.
&ldquo;Our systems have suffered one minor breakdown after another,
but we&rsquo;ve always been able to patch things up.
This time, though…&rdquo;
He shook his head.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never lost contact with Central before.
I&rsquo;ve been hailing it ever since I woke up,
but it&rsquo;s not responding at all—not even a service ping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet didn&rsquo;t know what a service ping was,
but the look on Captain Leung&rsquo;s face told her how worried her was.
&ldquo;I think Central spoke to me when I was in virtual,&rdquo;
she said hesitantly.
&ldquo;I asked it to wake me up whenever there was someone new,
and…&rdquo;
She stirred her stew for a moment,
her frown matching the captain&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,
that&rsquo;s all I can remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Leung shook his head.
&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter.
I ran a full diagnostic just before you woke up,
then double-checked it.
We&rsquo;ve been leaking deuterium for years.
Just a little at a time, but it has added up.
At this rate,
we&rsquo;ll lose re-entry capability in less than a decade.
We won&rsquo;t be able to go home,&rdquo;
he explained as Violet opened her mouth to ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;
Go home?
The thought felt oddly foreign.
The ark was home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s another thing,&rdquo;
the captain continued.
&ldquo;We may have lost contact with Central,
but we&rsquo;ve picked up a comms beacon for the first time in what feels like forever.
Here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pushed his bowl aside and put a tablet on the table.
Two taps brought up a map.
&ldquo;This is our original launch site.
All this used to be farmland,
but it flooded a few hundred years ago when the river changed course.
It&rsquo;s hard to tell from this far out,
but I imagine it&rsquo;s one big swamp by now.
This, on the other hand…&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet leaned in as he swiped the map sideways.
&ldquo;This looks like a village of some sort,
and the signal is coming from right there.
See the cleared patches around it?
Those look like fields to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you think there are people there?&rdquo;
Doctor Szego&rsquo; voice asked.</p>
<p>Captain Leung nodded.
&ldquo;Robots don&rsquo;t eat potatoes.&rdquo;
He studied the tablet a moment longer,
then looked at Violet.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we have a choice.
I think it&rsquo;s time to go home.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Chapter 3: Hide and Seek (Sindy)</h2>
<p>Sindy made a cheese and pickle sandwich to take to school the next morning,
then went back upstairs to brush her hair a second time.
Her bed was made,
and all her clothes were put away,
so as much as she wanted a reason to put off going to school,
she was fresh out.</p>
<p>She missed walking into Rusty Bridge with Maddy and Gumption.
Her big sister had stopped holding her hand years ago,
but even if they didn&rsquo;t talk much,
her company had been comforting.
Sindy hadn&rsquo;t realized how much that mattered to her until it ended.
Now,
the walk to school was just another reminder of how lonely she felt.</p>
<p>She slipped into the one-room schoolhouse
and slid into her usual seat near the back
just moments before Miz Nabbles cleared her throat and said,
&ldquo;All right, everyone, let&rsquo;s quiet down and get started, shall we?
Oh, good morning, Mister Goat—so nice of you to join us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy didn&rsquo;t looked up as Bravo Goat muttered,
&ldquo;Sorry, Miz Nabbles,&rdquo;
and plopped himself in the seat next to hers.</p>
<p>Miz Nabbles sniffed disapprovingly.
&ldquo;Will you brother be joining us today,
or does he still have—what was it this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cold, Miz Nabbles.
He&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; better, but he says he&rsquo;s still under it.&rdquo;
Bravo didn&rsquo;t even try to make the excuse convincing.</p>
<p>Someone snickered.
Miz Nabbles sniffed again.
&ldquo;Well, I suppose we&rsquo;ll just have to muddle through without him.
Now, who wants to share their answers for yesterday&rsquo;s arithmetic with the class?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused expectantly.
&ldquo;Anyone? No?
What about you, Sindy?
Do you have something for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind of,&rdquo;
she said reluctantly.
&ldquo;I did all the questions about loans and interest,
but the triggernometry—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tri<em>go</em>nometry,&rdquo; Miz Nabbles corrected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;—tri<em>go</em>nometry was really hard.
I didn&rsquo;t even really know how to start,&rdquo;
Sindy confessed.</p>
<p>Miz Nabbles flicked her tail.
&ldquo;Well, we went over it <em>twice</em> in class.
It really shouldn&rsquo;t be that difficult,
particularly not for someone with your special abilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy&rsquo;s ears burned.
<em>Just &lsquo;cuz I can use tech doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m good at math,</em>
she thought but didn&rsquo;t say.
She actually had been able to do most of the problems,
but when she had shown up last week with all her homework done,
some of the other kids had called her a show-off.
Sometimes it seemed like there were no right answers.</p>
<p>Recess came exactly an hour and a half later.
She pretended to be writing a note in her practice book
until most of her classmates had poured out the door into the playground,
then followed them.
Bravo and some other boys her age had found long sticks
and were practicing the pike drills
they had seen the town&rsquo;s militia do.
Melia Fox and two other girls were skipping rope—Sindy knew
she wouldn&rsquo;t be welcome there—but
a few of the younger children seemed to be organizing a game of freeze tag.</p>
<p>She stood and waited on the edge of the group
while they settled on the precise rules.
After ignoring her for a few moments,
Melia&rsquo;s younger sister glanced at her.
&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; she said insincerely,
&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve got too many people already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy waited just long enough for the moment to become uncomfortable
before saying,
&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo;
and turning away.
Feeling more alone than ever,
she walked slowly over to the toybox,
took out three cloth balls,
and started to practice juggling,
just like she had every day last week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault,&rdquo; she wanted to say,
except she didn&rsquo;t know who she would say it to.
It wasn&rsquo;t her fault that she was a throwback.
(&ldquo;Original,&rdquo; she heard Maddy correct her in her head.
&ldquo;The word is &lsquo;original&rsquo;.&rdquo;)
It wasn&rsquo;t her fault that the Operators had kidnapped her
and tried to hand her over to the bots in Heck.
(But the sidelong looks when she went into town told her
exactly who was thinking that there had to have been a reason.)
It wasn&rsquo;t her fault that Special Leaf had died.
(But he wouldn&rsquo;t have been injured if she hadn&rsquo;t lost control,
and no matter what Doc Whinny and Mayor Lupus and everyone said,
that <em>had</em> to have weakened him.)</p>
<p>Miz Nabbles set them free at noon.
Sindy didn&rsquo;t bother to try to find someone to sit with for lunch.
Instead,
she took the shortcut between the lumber yard and Ox brothers&rsquo; brewery
to the dirt road that led out of town.
She ate her sandwich as she walked,
wishing with every dry mouthful that she had brought a water bottle as well.</p>
<p>She needed a hobby, she decided,
kicking a loose stone into the knee-high weeds at the side of the road.
Maddy had her drawing and Gumption was learning to be a mechanic—she
should find something she could do on her own
that <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> involve the Makers&rsquo; ancient tech.
She had tried sewing and baking and singing and whittling and now juggling,
but nothing ever held her interest more than a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Sindy kicked another rock into the weeds
and tossed the last crust of her sandwich over her shoulder for luck.
At least the bots would be happy to see her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,
Sindy.
I have promised to repair the Foxes&rsquo; cart by sundown.
Perhaps we can play tag some other time.&rdquo;
The buzzing undertone of Dockety&rsquo;s voice hadn&rsquo;t changed,
but Sindy still wasn&rsquo;t used to the bot referring to itself as &ldquo;I&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; she said,
trying to to keep the disappointment out of her voice.
Dockety&rsquo;s eyes rotated and rotated back in its equivalent of either a shrug or a smile,
she was never sure which.
It turned back to the cart in question,
the back end of which was resting on a tree stump
while the bot mended its rear axle.</p>
<p>Crusher and Beevy were busy turning logs into planks,
not that either would been much fun to play tag with.
She didn&rsquo;t really know any of the other bots she could see
well enough to ask them to play.
<em>I should have just gone home,</em>
she thought,
then jumped and squeaked as something pinched her ankle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gotcha tee hee hee,&rdquo;
said a deep voice.
The same words scrolled across the screen
on the front of the little bot that had rolled up behind her.</p>
<p>Sindy put her hands on her hips and scowled down at it.
&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t funny, Mouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was too.&rdquo;
The little bot flashed a pattern of sparkles on its screen.
It zipped back and forth,
pleased with itself.</p>
<p>Sindy rolled her eyes.
&ldquo;Fine.
Maybe it was a little funny.
Hey,
do you want to play tag?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took her a minute to explain the rules.
&ldquo;You can be &lsquo;it&rsquo; first,&rdquo; she finished.
&ldquo;Ready?
Hey!&rdquo;
She yelped as Mouse poked her with its single skinny arm
and immediately raced away,
its four wheels bouncing over the stones and potholes of Bots&rsquo; End&rsquo;s single short street.</p>
<p>She gave chase,
only for the little bot to disappear under the raised floor of a nearby building.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not fair! Come back out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope.
Tee hee hee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy crouched down.
She could see sparkles of amusement on Mouse&rsquo;s screen,
but she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to reach it unless she lay down and got dirt all over her dress.
Even if she did,
the bot could just roll back.</p>
<p>She sat back on her haunches.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not you play tag, Mouse,&rdquo; she repeated.
&ldquo;You have to be somewhere the other person <em>could</em> catch you or it&rsquo;s no fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence,
and then then Mouse rolled out from under the building.
<code>you didn't say that was a rule</code> scrolled accusingly across its screen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;
Sindy had played with Mouse often enough to know that
not using its voice was its way of showing its feelings were hurt.
&ldquo;How about we try again some other time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her mood and the sky darkened in time with each other as she walked home.
The first few drops of rain began to spatter around her
just as she reached her front door.
&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; she said in answer to her father&rsquo;s question about how school had been.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do homework.&rdquo;
She trudged up the stairs without waiting for a response,
closed the door behind her,
and flopped on her bed.</p>
<p>Staring at the ceiling didn&rsquo;t make her feel any better.
Neither did re-doing the braid in her hair,
and the books sitting on her side table
just reminded her of Special Leaf.
Papa Roo would play checkers with her if she asked him to,
but she hated it when people did things because they felt sorry for her.</p>
<p>She picked up the little gray cylinder she had found in Special Leaf&rsquo;s house
and frowned at the little green light blinking on one end.
It hadn&rsquo;t been doing that yesterday, had it?
She turned it over,
looking for a button or switch or anything else.
&ldquo;So what do you do?&rdquo; she asked out loud.</p>
<p>And froze as an unknown voice responded,
&ldquo;What do you mean, what do I do?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Chapter 4: The Voice (Violet)</h2>
<p><em>I think it&rsquo;s time to go home.</em>
The sentence went around and around in Violet&rsquo;s head
like the merry-go-round in the virtual funfair she still sometimes visited
when she was feeling particularly lonely.
What did &ldquo;home&rdquo; even mean?
She remembered air that smelled like fresh flowers
and the warmth of sunlight on her skin,
but she also remembered people shouting
and the final night-time rush to get to the ark
and the feeling of being crushed into her seat as it launched.</p>
<p>At first she thought they would return right away.
Like everything involving adults,
it turned out to be slower and more complicated.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been asleep a lot longer than we planned,&rdquo;
Doctor Szego said.
&ldquo;We have double-check everything before we can even start planning re-entry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even then…&rdquo; Captain Leung muttered under his breath,
scowling at a display showing red bars
that Violet was pretty sure were supposed to be green.
He sat back in his chair to stretch,
blinking as if suddenly remembering that Violet could overhear the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo;
he said with a smile Violet didn&rsquo;t actually find reassuring.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sort it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sorting it out turned out to mean a space walk.
Doctor Szego wanted to send one of the service bots,
but Captain Leung insisted that he had to do it.
&ldquo;Have you forgotten why we had to launch in such a hurry?&rdquo;
he demanded.
&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s been compromised,
it could cripple us or worse.
And it&rsquo;s not like you can do it,
or one of the children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet watched through half a dozen cameras as he climbed into
a bulky yellow spacesuit.
Doctor Szego talked him through a checklist full of numbers and acronyms.
Twice they stopped to swap a malfunctioning piece of equipment on his suit
for its match from the other three suits hanging in the bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think it&rsquo;ll be our turn some day?&rdquo;
Violet asked André on their private channel.</p>
<p>He blew a raspberry through the speaker.
&ldquo;Fat chance.
They&rsquo;re lucky they can get even one suit working any more.
By the time they let us try
we&rsquo;ll be lucky if there&rsquo;s a pair of gloves left.
Bet you something goes kablooie while he&rsquo;s out there.
I saw that happen in virtual once.
The guy&rsquo;s head swelled up and—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;André!&rdquo;
Doctor Szego&rsquo; voice cut in sharply.
&ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s going to go wrong,
and even if it did,
people don&rsquo;t actually explode in space,
so let&rsquo;s not give anyone a reason to have nightmares,
all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, doctor,&rdquo; he muttered.
Violet heard a small <em>click</em> as he cut comms,
leaving just the soft wheeze of the air circulation system
and the intermittent beeping of the ark&rsquo;s displays
for her to listen to.
<em>So much for &lsquo;private channel&rsquo;,</em> she thought despondently.
Maybe once the ark landed she would finally be able to do something
without someone or something watching.
She wondered if that would feel strange.</p>
<p>At first Captain Leung&rsquo;s excursion was less exciting
than a ride on the virtual merry-go-round.
She watched through the camera on his helmet
as he swung out through the hatch,
clipped a tether to a guide wire,
opened a panel,
and replaced one nondescript rectangular bit of something or other
with another that looked identical.
That done,
he closed the panel,
turned around,
and paused for a moment.
&ldquo;Quite the view, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said,
his voice echoing slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;
A quarter circle of white-blue-green filled one corner of camera&rsquo;s view.
The sun was about to set,
but no,
she could see that was wrong.
The planet <em>rising</em> to block out the sky,
or the ark was falling,
down down down but moving so fast that it never hit the ground.
It was beautiful and impossible and scary all at once,
but &ldquo;home&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Without warning half of the screens in front of Violet went red.
<code>ERROR</code> flashed on some,
<code>DANGER</code> on others.
Wireframe schematics appeared, spun around, and zoomed in.
Highlight arrows popped up,
one three six a dozen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Szego! What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo;
Captain Leung barked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Overload in relay six.
Checking…
Correction, in relays six, seven, and nine.&rdquo;
Doctor Szego spoke quickly.
&ldquo;The optical conduit you just swapped in must have gone glassy.&rdquo;
She paused.
&ldquo;Warning.
The aft central vernier thruster is about to fire.
Brace for maneuver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Leung had time for a brief curse before
a giant nudged the ark with its shoulder.
Violet&rsquo;s heart leaped into her throat
as the view through his helmet camera tumbled wildly.
Another display showed his legs swing free of the ark&rsquo;s hull,
making it look as though he was dangling from one hand beneath the ark.
&ldquo;Shut it down!
Shut it down!&rdquo;
he shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re locked out,&rdquo; she replied,
her voice as calm as ever.
&ldquo;Hang on a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that meant to be funny?&rdquo;
the captain grunted,
swinging around to grab his tether.</p>
<p>The giant nudged the ark again,
harder this time.
Violet fumbled with the safety straps on her seat.
&ldquo;André?&rdquo; she said,
trying to keep the panic out of her voice.
&ldquo;André,
are you all right?&rdquo;
He didn&rsquo;t answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain, I suggest we vent propellant from tank B,&rdquo;
Doctor Szego said.
&ldquo;The thruster can&rsquo;t fire if it doesn&rsquo;t have any fuel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;
Captain Leung had wrapped a loop of the tether around his forearm
and was trying to get his boots back on the hull.
&ldquo;We need that for re-entry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the thruster keeps firing,
re-entry will no longer be an option.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Leung hesitated a moment longer.
&ldquo;Do it,&rdquo; he ordered crisply.</p>
<p>One of the displays in front of Violet switched views
to show a stretch of hull
beneath a perfectly black sky decorated with tiny bright shards of diamond.
She only had a second to take in the view
before a white cloud erupted from the ark,
the fuel instantly freezing into a million more sparkles.</p>
<p>Another display flashed <code>FUEL EXPENDED</code>
as the errant thruster tried to fire one last time.
Captain Leung swore again.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s going to make things interesting,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will figure it out,&rdquo;
Doctor Szego replied.
&ldquo;We always do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet went down to the airlock and waited for it to cycle.
Captain Leung barely glanced at her as he re-entered the ark,
already on his way aft to inspect the damage.
For the thousandth time,
Violet wished she could do something useful.</p>
<p>Hours later,
she woke from a restless sleep
to lie in her cot and listen to the quiet ever-present sounds
of the machine that was her home.
She knew right away that she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get back to sleep.
After half an hour of tossing and turning proved her right,
she got up,
scratched the stubble on her shaven head,
and slipped her feet into her padded tabis.</p>
<p>The lights in the corridor felt too bright,
and she didn&rsquo;t think she could stomach another bowlful of goop,
so she made her way to the bridge
and sat in the captain&rsquo;s chair.
She didn&rsquo;t exactly have permission to do that,
but no one had ever actually told her that she couldn&rsquo;t,
and anyway,
none of the ark&rsquo;s critical systems would respond to her voice.</p>
<p>She swiped the nearest display to bring up
a video loop of a dozen different kinds of animals.
Bears and bison,
rabbits and raccoons,
tigers and tortoises,
kangaroos and crocodiles:
a few looked cuddly,
and others were a little bit frightening,
but some of them seemed strangely familiar.</p>
<p>She shook her head.
The things she had met in virtual weren&rsquo;t real,
but that didn&rsquo;t mean they weren&rsquo;t based on real things.
The merry-go-round, for example—she (thought she) remembered
actually riding one before the rush to the ark and the long sleep that followed.
Had she spoken to a hybrid kangaroo when she was little,
or had the ark&rsquo;s computer picked it out of her imagination
and reflected it back to her?</p>
<p>A light blinked next to one of the displays.
It had been blinking for a while,
she realized,
wiping her eyes with her sleeve.
She slapped the light angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what do you do?&rdquo; a voice asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, what do I do?&rdquo;
she answered without thinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh great, you can talk,&rdquo; the voice muttered
as if speaking to herself.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you know any good jokes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet rolled her eyes.
Computers had <em>lousy</em> taste in jokes,
but she could play along.
&ldquo;Knock knock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Banana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Banana who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knock knock,&rdquo; Violet repeated.</p>
<p>She practically heard the voice roll her eyes.
&ldquo;I know this one.
You say banana a couple of times,
and then you say orange,
and when I ask, orange who?
you say—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Orange you glad I didn&rsquo;t say banana?&rdquo;
Violet finished in unison with the voice.
&ldquo;Your turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it have to be a knock-knock joke?&rdquo;
the voice asked.</p>
<p>Violet shrugged, already bored.
&ldquo;Whatever.
What else do you have in your archive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your archive,&rdquo; Violet repeated impatiently.</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have an archive.&rdquo;
The voice sounded unsure of itself.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a person, not a bot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet blinked.
Computers were <em>never</em> allowed to pretend to be people,
but if the ark&rsquo;s rockets could misfire,
maybe other things were broken too.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a person, what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sindy,&rdquo; the voice replied.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Violet.
Don&rsquo;t you already know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another moment of silence.
&ldquo;Do you know my sister Maddy?
She&rsquo;s a roo.
She said—&rdquo;
The voice swallowed hard enough to be heard.
&ldquo;When we were in Heck,
she was in some sort of computer thing,
and she told me she met someone named Violet.
Is that you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet felt a pressure on her chest as if the ark was accelerating.
&ldquo;A roo?
You mean, like a kangaroo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.
She and mama and papa are all roos.
I&rsquo;m—I&rsquo;m different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet felt her fingers dig into the arms of the captain&rsquo;s chair,
but it was as if they belonged to someone else.
&ldquo;Are you—are you on the ground?
Like,
for real on the ground?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m in my bedroom.
Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet glanced up at the main display,
which showed the planet below them.
&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m in space.
I&rsquo;m in an ark in space.
I think I met your sister in virtual.
We&rsquo;re going to land soon,&rdquo;
she added in a breathless rush.
&ldquo;Like,
tomorrow soon.
Lots of things are broken and Central isn&rsquo;t talking to us any more
so Captain Leung and Doctor Szego decided we have to land and,
and if this map is right,
we&rsquo;re going to land right next to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Violet!
Shut that down!&rdquo;
She jumped at the captain&rsquo;s voice
and twisted around
just as he reached past her and slapped the display
to cut off the conversation.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Chapter 5: Unwelcome Guests (Sindy)</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Violet!
Shut that down!&rdquo;
Sindy jumped as a second voice,
older and deeper,
barked the order.
The green light on the cylinder in her hand blinked twice,
then went dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; she said tentatively.
&ldquo;Are you still there?&rdquo;
Nobody answered.</p>
<p>For a moment she wanted to throw the cylinder out her window
or stomp on it until it broke into a hundred useless pieces,
except her window was closed
and she was only wearing socks
and it took a lot more than stomping to break anything the Makers had made.
She settled for tossing it onto her side table
and rolling over to bury her face in her pillow.
Why couldn&rsquo;t the world just leave her alone for a while?</p>
<p>She thumped her pillow with her forehead,
then sat up with a sigh
and made her way downstairs.
Her father was sitting at the kitchen table
drawing the outlines of letters on a piece of canvas
that her mother would then turn into an awning.
He looked up as she came in and smiled.
&ldquo;Homework all done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
She put the cylinder on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;
He reached for it,
then stopped himself and looked at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo;
she said grumpily.</p>
<p>He picked it up and turned it over curiously.
&ldquo;What does it do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It talks.
At least it did.
It told me it&rsquo;s out in space
but it met Maddy
and it&rsquo;s going to land here tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Papa Roo studied her for a moment
before setting it down and pushing his chair back.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go get Mama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy repeated the entire conversation as well as she could to her parents,
then again half an hour later to Mayor Lupus in town.
The old wolf studied the cylinder,
then handed it back to Sindy and scratched her ear doubtfully.
&ldquo;If anyone else told me this I&rsquo;d ask &lsquo;em if they&rsquo;d bumped their head,
but after everythin&rsquo; you&rsquo;ve been through…&rdquo;</p>
<p>She leaned back in her chair.
&ldquo;You think this has anythin&rsquo; to do with that shootin&rsquo; star?&rdquo;
she asked Papa Roo.
&ldquo;And those dreams you&rsquo;ve been havin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy&rsquo;s father shifted uncomfortably.
&ldquo;I wish I knew.
The dreams have stopped, mostly.&rdquo;
Which Sindy knew was a lie.
Papa Roo didn&rsquo;t lose track of who he was any more,
or spend hours obsessively drawing the same simple figures over and over,
but he still argued with himself in his sleep loudly enough to wake her sometimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo;
Mayor Lupus straightened a pile of papers on her desk.
&ldquo;Well,
if all we have is a voice tellin&rsquo; us a story,
I don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s much we can do.
I&rsquo;m not sayin&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t believe you,&rdquo;
she continued,
raising a finger to cut Sindy off.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just sayin&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t know what move to make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sighed.
&ldquo;I miss Leaf already.
He always had somethin&rsquo; to suggest at times like these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had just stood up to leave when the mayor&rsquo;s grand-nephew burst in.
&ldquo;Aunty Lupus!
Aunty Lupus!
You gotta come see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mayor scowled.
&ldquo;Cody Wolf, what have I told you about knockin&rsquo; when I&rsquo;ve got folks in?
You want to be my assistant,
you got to—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But aunty, he&rsquo;s back!&rdquo;
the young wolf said,
his eyes wide.
&ldquo;Special Blazes!
He&rsquo;s back!
An&rsquo; he brought a <em>crocodile</em>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mayor Lupus was out of her chair and at the window
before Sindy could properly digest what Cody had said.
&ldquo;Well ain&rsquo;t that just peachy,&rdquo;
the old wolf muttered a moment later.
&ldquo;Nephew!
Get yourself out to Bots&rsquo; End an&rsquo; tell Dockety and all them the news.
No,
use the back door.
Lickety quick now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned to the Roos.
&ldquo;I expect this is gonna have somethin&rsquo; to do with Special Leaf passin&rsquo;.
You folks want to be in the conversation,
or do you want to make use of the back door as well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mama Roo straightened in her chair.
&ldquo;We have nothing to hide,
especially not from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mayor Lupus nodded.
&ldquo;Figured you&rsquo;d feel that way.&rdquo;
Her grin showed teeth yellowed with age,
but still sharp.</p>
<p>Special Blazes was waiting for them
when they stepped out onto the porch of the mayor&rsquo;s house.
He had set a sturdy traveling pack on the bottom step,
but stood two steps back on the cobblestones.
His dark green uniform jacket was spotless,
its collar and cuffs matching the black patch over his eye.</p>
<p>His companion wore an identical uniform,
but that was where the similarities ended.
Sindy had seen reptiles before,
but Special Leaf had been the only one who actually lived in Rusty Bridge.
His skin had a pebbled texture,
more gray than green,
and his tail was even thicker than her father&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morning, Miz Mayor,&rdquo; Special Blazes said,
lisping slightly around his fangs.
&ldquo;You look well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been doin&rsquo; well, thank you,&rdquo;
the mayor replied levelly.
&ldquo;Must say I&rsquo;m surprised t&rsquo; see you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I would have written ahead,
but I figured the letter wouldn&rsquo;t get here much before me.
This is Nash, by the way.
He&rsquo;s my new deputy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crocodile doffed his hat.
&ldquo;Miz Mayor.&rdquo;
His voice was an octave lower than the tiger&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Mayor Lupus nodded curtly.
&ldquo;So now that we&rsquo;ve made introductions,
mind tellin&rsquo; me what brings you back to these parts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Special Blazes took an envelope from inside his jacket.
&ldquo;I have orders to inspect Special Leaf&rsquo;s home
and secure any tech that might present a threat to the general populace.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>You mean steal anything you think is useful,</em>
Sindy thought angrily.
Mama Roo&rsquo;s hand tightened slightly on her shoulder
as if she could read her daughter&rsquo;s thoughts.</p>
<p>The mayor&rsquo;s mechanical leg hummed slightly as she descended the steps
to pluck the envelope from Special Blazes&rsquo; hand.
She unfolded the letter it contained and pursed her lips as she scanned it.
&ldquo;Seems to be in order,&rdquo; she allowed.
&ldquo;Of course,
you&rsquo;ll need permission from the new owner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tiger shook his head.
&ldquo;Actually, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said apologetically.
&ldquo;Special Leaf collected quite a few odds and ends during his career.
Not all of them can be accounted for,
so if you check paragraph three…&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo;
The mayor held out the letter.
It took Sindy a moment to realize it was for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see that.&rdquo;
Papa Roo took it
and held it so that he and Mama Roo could puzzle over it together.</p>
<p>Without warning the crocodile unshouldered his pack and whirled around.
&ldquo;Trash cans coming, boss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear them,&rdquo;
the tiger replied calmly,
and a moment later Sindy did too.</p>
<p>Dockety and Beevy slowed to a stop as they came around the corner
and retracted their wheels
to walk the rest of the way across the town square.
Nash&rsquo;s hand twitched toward the holster on his hip,
but Special Blazes seemed unbothered by the bots&rsquo; arrival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Special,&rdquo;
Dockety said,
its voice buzzing slightly.
&ldquo;I am surprised to see you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tiger smiled.
&ldquo;Seems to be a common sentiment.
Maybe I should come &lsquo;round more often.&rdquo;</p>
<p><code>UNNECESSARY</code> scrolled across
the screen set into the front of Beevy&rsquo;s chassis.</p>
<p>Special Blazes&rsquo;s smile widened.
&ldquo;Nice to see you too.
Your new friends treating you well?&rdquo;</p>
<p><code>AT LEAST THEY ARE FRIENDS</code>
The tiger&rsquo;s smile slipped at that.
Until a few months ago,
Beevy had been Bee Six Vee,
and part of Special Blazes&rsquo; team.
Sindy hoped the sight of the bot stung a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Operators want to dig through Special Leaf&rsquo;s stuff,&rdquo;
the mayor explained in the silence that followed.
She jerked a thumb at the letter that Mama and Papa Roo were holding.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all legal and what-not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is sensible,&rdquo;
Dockety buzzed.
&ldquo;Would you like our assistance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t be necessary,&rdquo; Nash rumbled.</p>
<p>Special Blazes raised a hand.
&ldquo;Actually, a bit of help would be welcome.
I trust you&rsquo;ll join us as well, Miz Roo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy met his gaze.
&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cylinder in her pocket pinged softly.
<em>Not now,</em> she thought,
but it pinged again.
&ldquo;Are you there?&rdquo; a muffled voice said.</p>
<p>Special Blazes flicked an ear.
&ldquo;Something need your attention?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy took out the cylinder.
The green light on the end was glowing again.
&ldquo;Is anyone there?&rdquo; the voice said.
&ldquo;Can you hear me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can hear you,&rdquo; Sindy said.
&ldquo;Is this Violet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s me, it&rsquo;s me,
but it&rsquo;s happening,
it&rsquo;s happening now.
Captain Leung is about to start the re-entry burn.
We&rsquo;re going to land.
We&rsquo;re going to land <em>now</em>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo;
Special Blazes demanded.</p>
<p>Sindy shushed him with a wave.
&ldquo;What do you mean you&rsquo;re going to land?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean the ark is going to land!
I told you that!&rdquo;
The voice coming from the cylinder sounded frantic.
&ldquo;A whole bunch of stuff isn&rsquo;t working
but the captain says it&rsquo;s just going to get worse if we wait
so he&rsquo;s—whoa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something rumbled so loudly that the cylinder vibrated in Sindy&rsquo;s hand.
&ldquo;Violet?
Violet, can you hear me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was <em>that</em> all about?&rdquo;
the mayor demanded in exasperation.</p>
<p>Sindy looked at the now-silent cylinder.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s who I was telling you about.
She said she&rsquo;s in space right now but they&rsquo;re going to land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the most ridiculous thing I&rsquo;ve ever—what?&rdquo;
Special Blazes stopped mid-sentence as Nash elbowed him and pointed up,
where a smoky gray streak was drawing itself across the sky.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6: Landing (Violet)</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s happening now!&rdquo; Violet said.
She could hear the fear in her voice.
&ldquo;Captain Leung is about to start the re-entry burn.
We&rsquo;re going to land.
We&rsquo;re going to land <em>now</em>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo;
a gruff voice demanded,
just as the person she had spoken to before asked,
&ldquo;What do you mean you&rsquo;re going to land?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean the ark is going to land!
I told you that!
A whole bunch of stuff isn&rsquo;t working
but the captain says it&rsquo;s just going to get worse if we wait
so he&rsquo;s—whoa!&rdquo;
She grabbed the console in front of her as the ark shook,
her hand accidentally hitting the &ldquo;off&rdquo; button on the comms.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t time to worry about that now.
She had to get back to the bridge before—</p>
<p>&ldquo;Violet!
Where are you?
Main burn is starting in three minutes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my way, Captain!&rdquo;
She staggered on her way to the door
as the deck shuddered beneath her.
This wasn&rsquo;t virtual.
This was <em>real</em>.</p>
<p>She took the ladder to the bridge two rungs at a time.
Her usual somersault was out of the question:
even at the third floor,
where she was usually weightless,
she could feel herself being pressed back against the wall.</p>
<p>Captain Leung shot an angry look her way
as she buckled herself into her seat.
&ldquo;Where were you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just checking my pod,&rdquo;
she lied,
but he had already turned back to the screens and controls in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Main burn in thirty seconds.&rdquo;
Doctor Szego might as well have been saying that
the cafeteria was serving goop for lunch again.
&ldquo;Violet, are you strapped in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She clicked the last buckle into place.
&ldquo;Yes, doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo;
André said.
&ldquo;Thanks for asking.&rdquo;
His voice,
like the doctor&rsquo;s,
came through the speaker next to Violet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save it,&rdquo;
Captain Leung snapped.
&ldquo;This is going to be a bumpy ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten seconds.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
Ignition.&rdquo;
As Doctor Szego reached the end of her countdown,
an invisible giant hand pressed Violet back into her chair.
Vibration rumbled up her spine,
making her teeth chatter.</p>
<p>The captain cursed under his breath.
&ldquo;Number two engine is stuttering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it,&rdquo;
Doctor Szego replied calmly.
&ldquo;Compensating now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An image appeared on the main screen in front of them.
The dark blue bulk at the bottom was the planet below them.
A dashed green curve marked the orbit they had been in,
while a steeper solid curve projected their altered path.
Dozens of thinner red lines marked the trajectories of long-dead satellites,
fragments of booster rockets,
and other space junk.</p>
<p><em>THUMP!</em>
Captain Leung cursed again.
&ldquo;Szego!
What was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A boot of some sort,&rdquo; she replied.
&ldquo;There was no way to avoid it.
The hull appears undamaged.
There&rsquo;s more debris ahead.
I&rsquo;m going to roll to avoid it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet swallowed hard as her weight shifted to one side.
The green curve of their descent bent a little more
to avoid a cluster of red lines.
She clutched the arms of her chair.
The space combat games she had sometimes played with André
when he refused to play anything she actually liked
had never made her feel this helpless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Avoiding&rdquo; almost immediately turned out to mean
&ldquo;avoid as much big stuff as possible&rdquo;.
Over the centuries,
collisions between bits of space junk had produced a cascade of shrapnel.
The individual pieces were still scattered,
but at their speed that wasn&rsquo;t enough:
the sound of bits of metal clattering on the hull grew louder with each passing minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared,&rdquo;
André said through the speaker in Violet&rsquo;s headrest.
For once the sneer was missing from his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too.&rdquo;
She swallowed hard.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be over soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red lines sprouted on the screen faster and faster
until they were as thick as Violet&rsquo;s hair.
The clatter on the hull rose to a crescendo,
then abruptly stopped as the green line tracing the ark&rsquo;s descent
dipped below the junk.
Captain Leung sagged back in his seat and let his breath out with a whoosh.
&ldquo;So much for the easy part,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>A quick swipe brought up a dozen views of the ark&rsquo;s hull.
Violet swallowed again at the damage they showed.
Some scratches were superficial,
but here and there she saw jagged dents,
one of which was spraying a razor line of vapor into space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Szego?&rdquo;
the captain snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, captain.
First contact with atmosphere is in twenty seconds.
There&rsquo;s no way to repair it in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another swipe switched the view again.
They were so close to the planet now that it filled the entire screen.
White clouds looked like spilled paint on an ocean-blue background.
A break revealed land,
brown-gray instead of the green that Violet had imagined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that where we&rsquo;re landing?&rdquo;
André asked, awed.</p>
<p>Violet shook her head.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.
Wait—look!&rdquo;
The image in front of her was getting brighter.
A delicate orange tinge washed over it.
The ark began to rumble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve reached atmosphere,&rdquo;
Doctor Szego said.
&ldquo;Captain?
It&rsquo;s now or never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Initiate re-entry.&rdquo;
Violet heard the tension in his voice.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like we have a choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again an invisible giant hand pushed Violet back in her chair.
Angles and velocities scrolled by on the screen
as Captain Leung and Doctor Szego traded terse instructions.
Violet wondered if the people below could see them now.
They would look like a meteor.
They <em>were</em> a meteor, she realized.
They were a giant lump of metal falling from the sky
and no matter what happened,
this was a one-way trip.</p>
<p>Minutes ticked by in the corner of the screen.
The rumbling slowly began to subside.
&ldquo;Glide path achieved,&rdquo; Doctor Szego announced.
&ldquo;Ground speed is nominal.
We did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t jinx it,&rdquo; Captain Leung warned with a shaky laugh.
&ldquo;How are you holding up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took Violet a moment to realize he was speaking to her.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good.
Let&rsquo;s have a look, shall we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The view switched again,
and this time Violet gasped.
It <em>was</em> green,
green and beautiful.
A river carved a sinuous line across a broad grassy plain
that turned into forest as she watched.
The forest broke like a wave against snow-capped mountains,
only to resume again on their far side.</p>
<p>Another river appeared.
Violet&rsquo;s weight shifted as the ark banked to follow its course.
&ldquo;Are <em>you</em> all right?&rdquo; she asked André.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course I am, dummy.
Piece of cake.&rdquo;
She rolled her eyes,
relieved that he was back to being annoying.</p>
<p>Without warning the deck fell away beneath her.
She yelped as the whole ark dropped,
then rumbled as the engines fired.
&ldquo;What the hell was that?&rdquo; Captain Leung demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Number two engine has failed,&rdquo;
Doctor Szego announced calmly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to use the orbital thrusters to compensate,
but—hold on.&rdquo;
The ark plummeted again.
&ldquo;Thrusters are dry.
We have to set down <em>now</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; the captain demanded
even as his hands danced across the controls.
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t land in a forest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is clear ground ahead,
two minutes short of our target area.
I&rsquo;ll aim for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a swamp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it&rsquo;s a <em>soft</em> swamp,&rdquo; Doctor Szego replied.</p>
<p>Violet knew they were still moving incredibly fast,
but the ground seemed to crawl beneath them.
The lower they got the faster it moved.
There!
That was a building,
or it had been.
A handful of others flashed past,
all in ruins,
then a road,
a proper paved road like the ones she thought she remembered
from when she was little.
Down, down, down,
trees rushing away,
a flock of birds bursting into the air in terror,
and then the green suddenly became darker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten seconds.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
Contact.&rdquo;
The ark didn&rsquo;t shudder this time.
It shook and bounced,
throwing Violet forward as it shed speed.</p>
<p>Captain Leung whooped.
&ldquo;Touchdown!
We made it!
We made it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t jinx it,&rdquo; Captain Szego replied.
The captain laughed,
and Violet realized she was laughing too,
but crying too.
They had done it.
They had landed.</p>
<p>The ark tilted slightly.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Captain Leung demanded.
&ldquo;Are we taking on water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Checking.
No.&rdquo;
Doctor Szego paused.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something underneath us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?
What kind of something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The image on the display answered his question before Doctor Szego could.
An enormous metal tentacle lifted out of the swamp below them.
The hull rang as it grabbed the side of the ark.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7: The Thing in the Swamp (Sindy)</h2>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;
Special Blazes stopped mid-sentence as Nash elbowed him and pointed up,
where a smoky gray streak was drawing itself across the sky.
He whirled around and jabbed a clawed finger at Sindy.
&ldquo;Explain this. Now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; Sindy protested
&ldquo;I found this at Special Leaf&rsquo;s house
and there was a voice
and it told me they were going to land and—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They?&rdquo; the tiger growled.
&ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; Sindy repeated.
Her father&rsquo;s arm tightened around her shoulder protectively.
&ldquo;All I know is that her name is Violet
and she met Maddy in Heck,
kind of,
and they&rsquo;re in space but now they&rsquo;re going to land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Special Blazes locked eyes with the mayor.
&ldquo;This place is a madhouse,&rdquo; he spat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some days,&rdquo; Mayor Lupus agreed.
She rapped her gnarlywood cane on the porch.
&ldquo;Cody!
Get upstairs, lad, and ring the bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young wolf&rsquo;s eyes widened.
&ldquo;Really? Woo!&rdquo;
He charged past Sindy and into the house.
His boots thumped on the stairs,
and a moment later the alarm bell in the belfry above them began to clang.</p>
<p>It only took a few minutes for the first two dozen members of the town&rsquo;s militia
to assemble in a ragged line
with their pikes and nets and glue guns.
While others straggled in from the fields around Rusty Bridge,
the mayor and Special Blazes took turns explaining that no,
that wasn&rsquo;t a drill and yes,
it was about the thing in the sky.</p>
<p>Gumption and Maddy arrived together.
He kissed her cheek and took his place in line.
She hugged Sindy and then took her hand.
&ldquo;Never a dull moment,&rdquo; Maddy said,
forcing a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, listen up!&rdquo; Mayor Lupus bellowed.
&ldquo;Whatever this is,
it looks like it&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; down in our back yard,
so we&rsquo;re gonna go have a look.
No reason to think there&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s gonna make trouble,
but keep your wits about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gestured at the Operators.
&ldquo;Special Blazes here will be in charge.
Do what he tells you,
and for pity&rsquo;s sake,
don&rsquo;t go jumpin&rsquo; at shadows.&rdquo;
Her stern look swept across the ragged force in front of her,
making a couple of its members shift uncomfortably.</p>
<p>Dockety raised a hand.
&ldquo;Shall I gather others from the settlement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; the mayor said,
but, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Special Blazes said at the same moment.
&ldquo;Not until we know what this is,&rdquo;
the tiger continued.
&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s anything like Central,
we don&rsquo;t want to be up against your lot as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that is unlikely,&rdquo; Dockety buzzed.</p>
<p>Special Blazes&rsquo; ears went back.
&ldquo;Likely or not, that&rsquo;s how it is.
As for the rest of you,
let&rsquo;s get going.
The sooner we find this thing,
the sooner you can all be back home drinking tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He and the crocodile shouldered their packs and strode past the militia
without looking back.
After a curt nod from the mayor,
the townspeople fell in behind them.</p>
<p>Sindy suddenly realized that she was still holding the cylinder in her hand.
She wriggled out from her father&rsquo;s arm and hurried over to Dockety and Beevy.
&ldquo;You ever seen anything like this?&rdquo; she asked,
holding it out.</p>
<p>Dockety plucked it from her fingers.
Its eyes rotated and then rotated back as it studied the little piece of tech.
&ldquo;It is a communication device.
I would have to disassemble it to learn more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!
Sorry, I know you wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
Sindy took a deep breath.
High above their heads,
the wind was smearing the gray trail of smoke across the sky.
She hoped Violet was all right.</p>
<p>Dockety held out the communicator.
sindy tucked it back in her pocket.
Her jaw set.
People had come to her rescue.
Now it was her turn.
&ldquo;How long will it take us to get to the Mire?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Riding on top of Beevy wasn&rsquo;t as comfortable as riding piggy-back on Dockety,
but at least her legs didn&rsquo;t go to sleep.
She felt guilty for telling her parents that she was going to school,
but this was important.
She could apologize later.</p>
<p>The militia had taken the main road out of town,
so she and the bots had to use one of the many footpaths
that ran between the outlying farms.
Grampa Elk shouted something to her as they raced past.
She waved in response,
nearly sliding off Beevy&rsquo;s back as she did so.
After that she ignored the few people they saw
and focused on dodging low-hanging branches and not falling off.</p>
<p>The Mire was just a hundred meters away from the spot where
the path joined up with the Makers&rsquo; road.
The militia were just another hundred meters past that,
but Sindy didn&rsquo;t notice them at first
because there it was:
the ark.
It was taller than any building in Rusty Bridge and wider than the town square.
Steam rose from the water beneath it.</p>
<p>And it was under attack.
Three gray metal tentacles rose out of the swamp to grip it.
Even as she watched,
a fourth tentacle broke the surface and slithered up the ark&rsquo;s battered metal hull,
groping for purchase.</p>
<p>Sindy&rsquo;s heart leaped into her throat.
She knew those tentacles.
She and Maddy and Dockety had seen them
when they first took shelter in Patient&rsquo;s lair on the edge of the swamp.
Nobody knew what their owner looked like,
which only made her occasional nightmares worse.</p>
<p>They braked as they reached the militia.
Dockety retracted its single wheel and lowered its legs
as Sindy slid off Beevy&rsquo;s back with a groan.
She raised a finger to her lips as Gumption spotted her,
but it was too late:
Special Blazes had seen her too.</p>
<p>The tiger swore.
&ldquo;I told you to stay put!&rdquo;
He had unbuttoned his uniform jacket
to reveal a crystalline piece of tech strapped to his chest.
Beside him,
Nash was attaching something that looked like a pitchfork with a gunsight and trigger
to a sturdy metal tripod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We chose to disregard your request,&rdquo;
Dockety replied as <code>NO</code> scrolled across Beevy&rsquo;s screen.
Special Blazes made an angry noise in the back of his throat
and waved them off.</p>
<p><em>bzzz</em>
Sindy jumped.
It was the communicator in her pocket!
She pulled it out.
&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo;
a voice demanded.
It was the same person who had ordered Violet to shut down their earlier conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Sindy,&rdquo;
she said,
turning her back on the Operators and waving at Dockety to come closer.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m outside.
I mean,
beside you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them to release!
The hull&rsquo;s breached—we&rsquo;re taking on water.
They have to let us go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tentacles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!
We mean you no harm.
Please,
deactivate your defenses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy&rsquo;s eyes widened.
&ldquo;Me?
They&rsquo;re not mine!
Or ours—they live in the Mire.
We don&rsquo;t control them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you talking to?&rdquo;
Special Blazes demanded,
grabbing Sindy&rsquo;s arm.
&ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Captain Leung,&rdquo;
the voice replied.
&ldquo;And I say again,
we&rsquo;re taking on water.
Please,
shut down your defense system so our bots can make repairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Operator glanced at Beevy,
his eyes narrowing.
&ldquo;Your bots?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, our service bots.
Look,
that&rsquo;s not important right now—just turn the damn thing off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Special Blazes covered the communicator in Sindy&rsquo;s hand with his own.
&ldquo;Switch it off,&rdquo; he ordered.
&ldquo;The tech, not the thing in the swamp.
We have no idea who they are or if they&rsquo;re even people,&rdquo;
he continued as Sindy opened her mouth.
&ldquo;This could just be a trick by Central or something like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;re in trouble!&rdquo;
Sindy tried to pull her hand away,
but the tiger&rsquo;s grip was iron-strong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not asking,&rdquo; he growled.
He turned her hand over,
pulled the communicator from her fingers,
and stared at it.
A moment later the green light on its end blinked off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s mine!&rdquo;
Sindy protested,
but Special Blazes ignored her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice trick, boss,&rdquo; the crocodile said admiringly.
&ldquo;Do I get to shoot something now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy felt fury rising in her as the Operator turned his back on her.
That was <em>hers</em>!
Special or not, he had no right to take it from her!
And Violet needed her help!</p>
<p>Something stirred inside her,
something deeper and larger than her anger.
Suddenly she was aware of the two bots beside her
and the tech on Special Blazes&rsquo; chest
and the little echo of it in his hand.
She had felt this before,
when she had accidentally set off Special Blazes&rsquo; tech and injured Special Leaf,
but this time was different.
She clung to it the way she had clung to Beevy and reached out.</p>
<p>There.
Right in front of her.
It was so big she hadn&rsquo;t even noticed it at first,
but it was simple, too.
<em>Let go!</em> she thought,
not realizing she was shouting the words as well.
<em>Let go <strong>now</strong>!</em></p>
<p>The tentacles froze.
<em>Let! Go!</em> she repeated,
putting everything she had behind the two words.</p>
<p>The tentacles began slithering back down the side of the ark into the swamp.
Sindy had just enough time to think,
&ldquo;Huh—it worked,&rdquo;
before she collapsed on the ground.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Chapter 8: Ambush (Violet)</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I say again,
we&rsquo;re taking on water.
Please,
shut down your defense system so our bots can make repairs.&rdquo;
Violet could hear Captain Leung trying to keep his voice level
even as another indicator on the screen in front of them went from green to red.
The mechanical tentacles weren&rsquo;t just wrapped around the ark:
one had forced its way in through a crack in the hull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your bots?&rdquo;
the voice coming through the communicator growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, our service bots,&rdquo;
the captain replied impatiently.
&ldquo;Look,
that&rsquo;s not important right now—just turn the damn thing off!&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Click.</em>
<code>signal lost</code> appeared on the screen.
Captain Leung slapped the panel in frustration.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean the comms!
Doctor—please, give me some good news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, captain, I don&rsquo;t have any.&rdquo;
Doctor Szego sounded as calm as ever.
&ldquo;The main cargo bay is partially flooded,
it will take at least thirty hours to synthesize enough fuel to take off,
and our weapons are still inoperative.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>We have weapons?</em>
Violet had just a moment to wonder before the tentacles froze,
then began slithering back down the hull into the swamp.
The scraping sound grated through the bridge speakers for a few moments.</p>
<p>Captain Leung wasted no time.
His hands danced across the controls.
The ark began rumbling,
but the sounded stuttered almost immediately.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have enough fuel, captain,&rdquo; Doctor Szego said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worth a try,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;All right,
let&rsquo;s see who we&rsquo;re dealing with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Camera views opened on the screen,
panning across the people standing on the swamp&rsquo;s edge.
Violet blinked.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all &lsquo;brids,&rdquo; she said.
Some had canine muzzles,
while others had horns or antlers or even scales.
They were clothed,
and they all seemed to be holding weapons of various sorts.</p>
<p>All except one.
A normal-looking girl was being helped to her feet
by the strangest bot Violet had ever seen.
The girl&rsquo;s dress was a size too large for her,
and her curly black hair looked like a puffball around her dark face,
but everything Violet could see seemed completely human.</p>
<p>Captain Leung didn&rsquo;t seem to be looking at her, though.
Instead,
he had zoomed in on the bot that was helping her
and on the one behind them.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a Z-model defender,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Lots of modifications, but the basic chassis is a match.
No idea what the other one is, though.
It looks like someone took a pile of spare parts
and put them together on a bet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s some sort of personal assistant,&rdquo;
Doctor Szego mused.
&ldquo;Do you see how its arms are mis-matched?
The delicate one could be for medical work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about the <em>girl</em>?&rdquo; Violet burst out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm.&rdquo;
Captain Leung shifted the camera view.
The girl looked shaken,
but from the way she was shrugging free of the two-legged bot,
Violet guessed she was all right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another ark?&rdquo; Doctor Szego suggested.
&ldquo;Or perhaps some people stayed behind after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Leung sat back in his seat, frowning.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said after a moment,
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one way to find out.
Prep the shuttle—I&rsquo;ll go and say hello.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shuttle?&rdquo; Doctor Szego asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>The captain snorted.
&ldquo;Well,
I don&rsquo;t feel like going for a swim,
particularly not with that thing of theirs in the water.
And anyway,
it&rsquo;ll impress them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That shouldn&rsquo;t be necessary,&rdquo;
the doctor assured him.
&ldquo;Even after this long,
their conditioning should make them reasonably docile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Leung panned the camera across the crowd again.
Some had long poles with hooks on the ends.
Others had nets or short-barrelled hand cannons with wide mouths,
and the pitchfork thing that the large lizard was aiming at them
was all the more frightening for being unrecognizable.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we should count on that,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Get Z40 and Z51 online.
I&rsquo;ll take them with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And me,&rdquo; Violet said.
&ldquo;I want to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;
The captain and Doctor Szego spoke over each other.
Captain Leung glanced up at the nearest speaker.
&ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She <em>has</em> been talking to one of them,&rdquo;
the doctor reminded him.
&ldquo;And given the state of the ship,
I think she will be safer with you than she will be on board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Leung chewed his lip for a moment.
&ldquo;All right.
On one condition,&rdquo;
he added,
turning to Violet.
&ldquo;You will do <em>exactly</em> what I say, when I say it.
Understood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, captain,&rdquo;
she said,
but what she thought was,
<em>I&rsquo;m going outside!</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair,&rdquo;
André groused a few moments later.
&ldquo;How come I have to stay in my pod and you get to go fight monsters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not monsters,&rdquo; she corrected,
mentally adding,
<em>At least I hope they&rsquo;re not.</em>
&ldquo;And you have to stay inside because you&rsquo;re sick.
You know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still isn&rsquo;t fair.
Don&rsquo;t screw it up, all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their first stop was the airlock that held the space suits.
It was the first time Violet had worn one in real life,
and she was surprised by how light and stiff the fabric was.
And by how it smelled:
underneath the sharp sting of cleaning fluid
she could make out a whiff of ancient sweat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep the visor up,&rdquo;
was all Captain Leung said when she commented on it.
He swapped its gloves for another pair and muttered something about spare parts,
but finally stepped back and said that would have to do.</p>
<p>Violet&rsquo;s legs swished against each other as she followed him to the central ladder.
Her weight stayed the same the whole way down,
and for the first time she wondered if they were doing the right thing
or whether they should have stayed in space.
They had been attacked,
and everyone waiting to greet them seemed to have weapons—everyone except the girl,
who Violet really hoped was the person she had been talking to.</p>
<p>She climbed awkwardly through the shuttle&rsquo;s hatch, then froze.
Two large gray bots she had never seen before filled the back half of the cabin.
&ldquo;Z40&rdquo; was stencilled on the front of one and &ldquo;Z51&rdquo; on the other.
Their legs were folded beneath them,
and their arms were tucked against their sides,
but even so she could see they had the same overall design
as the bigger of the two bots waiting outside.
These hadn&rsquo;t been built to do repairs or look after people.
These had been built to fight.</p>
<p>Captain Leung must have seen the look on her face.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,
they have a dozen different firewalls to keep them on our side.
And if those don&rsquo;t work, I have this.&rdquo;
He pointed at one of the controls set into the chest of his suit.</p>
<p>Violet nodded,
not feeling reassured in the least,
and took her seat.
She nodded again when the captain asked if she was ready.</p>
<p>The shuttle&rsquo;s takeoff was as bumpy as the ark&rsquo;s landing,
but only lasted a second.
It took her a moment to realize that the view in front of her wasn&rsquo;t a screen.
She was looking through a windshield,
and that was actual sunlight making her squint.
Those were real trees in the distance,
and the blue overhead was the actual sky.
She wasn&rsquo;t in virtual.
This wasn&rsquo;t a simulation,
and she wasn&rsquo;t seeing what a camera chose to show her.
This was the world,
and she was in it.</p>
<p>Captain Leung gently eased the control stick to the side.
The shuttle tilted obediently
and drifted toward the edge of the swamp.
Violet saw the people scurry back out of their flight path
before her view was cut off by the shuttle&rsquo;s bulk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, here goes nothing,&rdquo;
the captain said to himself.
The rumble of the shuttle&rsquo;s engine quieted slightly
as they began to descend.</p>
<p>The shuttle&rsquo;s landing was as gentle as the ark&rsquo;s had been rough.
One moment they were in the air,
the next a trio of lights on the control panel showed that
all three of the shuttle&rsquo;s feet were on solid ground.
Captain Leung idled the engine for a moment,
then shut it down.</p>
<p>Sitting back,
he looked at Violet.
&ldquo;You sure you want to come with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded and forced a smile.
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said,
clapping her on the shoulder.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get this over with.
Z40!
Z51!
Up and at it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet stumbled back a step as the two bots lurched to their feet.
Captain Leung palmed a switch to open the hatch and waved them forward.</p>
<p>Metal clanked on metal as Z40 made its way to the exit,
tilted,
and disappeared down the steps.
Z51 was just about to do the same when someone outside shouted,
&ldquo;Those are combat bots!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The air crackled.
A bright flash lit up the hatchway,
dazzling Violet.</p>
<p>Captain Leung swore.
&ldquo;Back up! Back up!&rdquo;
He pushed Violet to the side to make room for Z51
as the hatchway lit up again.
A moment later Z40 scrambled backward into the shuttle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; Violet asked
as the hatch closed.</p>
<p>Captain Leung glared through the windshield.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re shooting at us,
that&rsquo;s what.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Chapter 9: You Just Gotta Show Them (Sindy)</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Sindy?
Sindy, are you damaged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She opened her eyes and looked up at Dockety&rsquo;s familiar metal face.
Why was the sky behind him?
Oh—she was on the ground.
Her tongue felt thick, and her head was throbbing.
Had she fallen out of a tree again?</p>
<p>She grabbed the manipulator Dockety offered her
and let the bot help her to her feet.
The spaceship was still floating in the swamp,
but the tentacles were gone.
Had she done that?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;m aright,&rdquo; she mumbled unconvincingly.</p>
<p><code>DO YOU NEED A RIDE?</code> scrolled across Beevy&rsquo;s screen.</p>
<p>She shook her head, immediately regretting it.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m aright,&rdquo; she repeated.
&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dockety&rsquo;s eyes rotated.
&ldquo;I was hoping you could tell us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! Topside!&rdquo;
Gumption said a few meters away,
pointing.
A gasp ran through the townspeople
as something the size of a large wagon rose from the top of the spaceship
on a blue-white haze too bright to look at directly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we go,&rdquo;
Nash said with relish,
aiming the pitchford gun he had set up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;
Mayor Lupus barked.
&ldquo;Nobody does anythin&rsquo; unless <em>I</em> say so.
You got that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crocodile glanced at her,
then at Special Blazes.
&ldquo;Boss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tiger&rsquo;s ears were flat against his head.
&ldquo;Keep your cool,
but keep finger on the trigger.
There may not be time for chit-chat, Miz Mayor,&rdquo;
he added.</p>
<p>The small craft made a half-circle overhead
like a bird inspecting a discarded crust of bread
before settling to the ground fifty meters away from the townspeople.
The light beneath it dimmed, hummed, and went out.
&ldquo;Now what?&rdquo; Sindy whispered.</p>
<p>Dockety clicked the fingers of its manipulator together in a rapid staccato.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
It was nervous,
Sindy realized with a shock.
She had never seen Dockety nervous before,
not even in battle.</p>
<p>Moments passed.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;re they waiting for?&rdquo; Nash hissed.</p>
<p>As if in answer,
a hatch opened on the small craft&rsquo;s side
and swung down silently to become a short flight of steps.
A gasp ran through the townspeople
as something large and rectangular appeared in the opening,
tilted,
and began to clamber down on four sturdy mechanical legs.
A second identical shape appeared behind it.</p>
<p>Sindy&rsquo;s heart went into her throat.
The two bots looked like Beevy,
but brand new instead of scarred and patched and repaired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are combat bots!&rdquo;
Special Blazes snarled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On it!&rdquo;
Nash aimed his pitchfork at the lead bot and fired.
The air crackled as lightning sliced the air and struck its target.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! Stop shooting, you idiot!&rdquo;
Mayor Lupus shouted as Nash fired a second time.
She grabbed his shoulder and tried to pull him away from the pitchfork gun,
only for him to knock her to the ground.</p>
<p><em>Thump!</em>
The crocodile hissed with rage as a net tangled around him,
sending him to the ground beside the mayor.
&ldquo;Whoops,&rdquo; Gumption said coolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody just <em>stop</em>!&rdquo; Special Blazes bellowed.
A moment later the hatch on the small craft closed with a clang
behind the two retreating bots.</p>
<p>Mayor Lupus rounded on the two Operators.
&ldquo;I said nobody does anything &lsquo;til <em>I say so</em>!&rdquo;
Her fury was as white-hot as the lightning Nash had fired at the bots.</p>
<p>Special Blazes stepped between her and Nash.
&ldquo;Those were war machines.
Do you understand?
Keeping you safe from bots like that is our whole job!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; the mayor spat.
&ldquo;I thought your job was kidnappin&rsquo; kids!&rdquo;
She jerked a clawed thumb over her shoulder at Sindy.</p>
<p>For a split second Sindy thought the tiger was going to throw a punch or a fireball,
but instead he took a deep breath and shook his head.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to apologize for that,
not to you or anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the two argued over what to do next,
Sindy turned to Dockety and Beevy.
&ldquo;You ever seen anything like them?
Those two bots, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p><code>YES</code> Beevy scrolled.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dockety said in its buzzing voice.
&ldquo;The Operator is correct.
They were built for violent encounters,
and appear unmodified.
They would be quite formidable in a fight.&rdquo;
It emitted a brief burst of static.
Speckles of light danced across Beevy&rsquo;s screen in response.
&ldquo;Even Crusher would find it hard to defeat them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something shifted deep inside Sindy.
Her sister and Gumption had been brave so many times.
Now it was her turn.</p>
<p>Her jaw set.
&ldquo;Well then, we better make sure it doesn&rsquo;t come to that,&rdquo;
she said firmly.
&ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Mayor and Special Blazes were still arguing.
Everyone else was too busy watching them
to notice Sindy and the two bots quietly retreat into the trees.
Damp soil yielded beneath them as they picked their way
between drooping willow branches.
Sindy kept thinking that they would be too late,
that the little ship would take off again,
but it stayed where it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aright,&rdquo; she finally said.
They weren&rsquo;t actually much closer to the ship,
but they were far enough away from the militia
that nobody would be able to hit her with a ball of glue
or tangle her in a net.
She had no idea what the range of Nash&rsquo;s lightning gun was.
All she could do was hope he wouldn&rsquo;t use it on her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you certain you want to do this?&rdquo; Dockety asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; Sindy said.
She forced a grin and then stepped out of the trees
and began walking toward the ship with her arms in the air.
She really hoped Dockety and Beevy were behind her.
&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; she called.
&ldquo;Hi!
Remember me?
I&rsquo;m the one you were talking to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sindy Roo, you get back here right now!&rdquo;
She ignored the mayor&rsquo;s shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo;
She stopped and lowered her arms halfway to the little craft.
&ldquo;Um,
I&rsquo;m sorry about what happened back there.
You just startled them, is all.
We&rsquo;ve never seen spaceships before.
But look,
we have bots too,
see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She half-turned and waved at Dockety and Beevy.
Dockety raised a manipulator and waved.
Beevy flashed <code>HELLO</code> on its screen.</p>
<p>Sindy took another step toward the small craft.
&ldquo;If you want to come out and talk,
I promise they won&rsquo;t shoot at you again.&rdquo;
<em>I hope,</em> she added mentally.
&ldquo;Or if you just want to sit for a bit,
that&rsquo;s aright too.
You can&rsquo;t use the communicator thing to tell me, though.
I don&rsquo;t have that any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood and waited,
not knowing what else to say.
She felt like she did when she had to stand up and answer a question in Miz Nabbles&rsquo; class,
or when she heard other kids talking about a birthday party
and she didn&rsquo;t know if she was going to be invited or not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, they&rsquo;re just afraid.&rdquo;
The words slipped out before she could think them through.
&ldquo;You just gotta show them that they got nothing to be afraid of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing happened for a few moments.
Then the hatch on the craft&rsquo;s side swung open
and a figure in a bulky yellow suit appeared at the top step.
Sindy&rsquo;s breath caught.
Was it a person or a bot?
It had two arms and two legs,
but its head was as big and as round as a bucket,
and its mirrored front gave no hint of its contents.</p>
<p>The figure came down the steps slowly.
A second, smaller one appeared behind it
but stayed in the entrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greetings.&rdquo;
The voice seemed to come from the little ship.
&ldquo;We come in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy raised one hand.
&ldquo;Us too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you in command here?&rdquo; the voice asked.
It was deeper and older than the one she had heard through the communicator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?
Um, no, that would be the mayor.&rdquo;
She waved at the townspeople fifty meters away.
&ldquo;Her name is Lupus—Mayor Lupus.
I&rsquo;m Sindy,
and this is Dockety and Beevy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Captain Leung,
commander of Ark Nineteen.
This is Violet.&rdquo;
The lead figure gestured at the one waiting at the top of the steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pleased to meet you,&rdquo; Sindy said.
&ldquo;Are you really from space?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not originally.
Are you from the town we saw over that way?&rdquo;
The figure gestured in the direction of Rusty Bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s us.
The mayor,
well,
that&rsquo;s what she&rsquo;s the mayor of.
And Dockety here,
it&rsquo;s like the mayor for the bots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the bots,&rdquo; the voice repeated slowly.
&ldquo;Interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Sindy could think of what to say next,
the smaller figure reached up and took its head off.
At least that&rsquo;s what Sindy thought at first.
It took her a moment to realize it was just a helmet,
and that underneath it was the actual head of a girl about her own age
with a narrow, dark face and curly purple hair.</p>
<p>Sindy gaped at her.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a throwback!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>The girl blinked.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what that is.
I&rsquo;m human, just like you.&rdquo;</p>

<section>
<h2>Chapter 10: Attack (Violet)</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Pleased to meet you,&rdquo; Sindy said.
&ldquo;Are you really from space?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not originally,&rdquo;
Captain Leung replied through the shuttle&rsquo;s speakers.
He had warned Violet not to give too much away
until they knew what they were up against.
&ldquo;Are you from the town we saw over that way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s us.&rdquo;
Sindy spoke in a rush.
&ldquo;The mayor,
well,
that&rsquo;s what she&rsquo;s the mayor of.
And Dockety here,
it&rsquo;s like the mayor for the bots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the bots,&rdquo; Captain Leung repeated.
&ldquo;Interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of a sudden Violet couldn&rsquo;t stand it any more.
She had spent her whole life wondering what fresh air would smell like
and what it would feel like to have grass under her feet—<em>real</em> grass,
not simulated in virtual.
She reached up,
undid the clip that held her helmet in place,
and took it off.</p>
<p>Sindy gasped.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a throwback!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet blinked.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what that is.
I&rsquo;m human, just like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Violet!&rdquo;
André&rsquo;s voice came faint and tinny from the helmet in her arms.
&ldquo;Violet, what&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh,&rdquo; she hissed,
trying to keep her smile in place.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Violet, I can&rsquo;t see!
Put your—&rdquo;
<em>click</em>
She thumbed the switch on her helmet to cut him off.</p>
<p>Captain Leung took off his helmet.
&ldquo;Permission to come aboard?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;
Sindy blinked at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means, may he come down off the steps?&rdquo;
the scrapwork two-legged bot behind her buzzed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure.
Or, um, maybe you better wait and ask the mayor.
If that would be aright?&rdquo;
she added hastily.</p>
<p>Violet followed her eyes.
Two &lsquo;brids had separated from the crowd and were walking toward them.
One clearly had some tiger in its genes.
The other—she couldn&rsquo;t decide if it was descended from a dog or a wolf,
but it was clearly canine.</p>
<p><em>She,</em> Violet corrected herself as the pair neared.
The wolf with the cane and cyborg leg was a she.
The tiger was a he,
and had a patch over one eye.
His green-and-black jacket looked a lot like a uniform.</p>
<p>Captain Leung waited,
his helmet cradled in one arm.
As the two &lsquo;brids neared,
the scrapwork bot stepped forward to join them.
The tiger gave it a dirty look, but said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo; the wolf said politely.
&ldquo;Seems you&rsquo;ve come a long way.
Sorry &lsquo;bout all the fuss earlier.
Some folks were just feelin&rsquo; a bit agitated, was all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; Captain Leung replied,
his tone just as casual.
&ldquo;And no harm done—it takes a lot more than a bit of electricity
to faze one of those Z-bots.
As I&rsquo;m sure you know,&rdquo;
he added,
nodding toward the larger bot standing behind the newcomers.
&ldquo;I take it you&rsquo;re the mayor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wolf straightened slightly.
&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that mean you&rsquo;re in charge here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
The wolf and tiger spoke simultaneously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the mayor means,&rdquo; the tiger said,
&ldquo;Is that she&rsquo;s in charge of everything day-to-day.
Special circumstances are my responsibility,
and I think we can all agree that your ship there qualifies as &lsquo;special&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine it does,&rdquo;
Captain Leung said drily.
&ldquo;And how about your friend there?
Your young friend said it&rsquo;s some kind of mayor for the local bots?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tiger glanced at the wolf.
&ldquo;More or less.
I&rsquo;m Lupus, by the way, and this is Special Blazes.
That&rsquo;s Dockety,
and of course you&rsquo;ve already met Sindy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Captain Leung,
commander of Ark Nineteen,
and this is Violet.&rdquo;
He gestured toward her without taking his eyes off their visitors.
&ldquo;I must say,
it&rsquo;s remarkable you&rsquo;ve been able to keep your bot running.
All those replacements and repairs must have required
a great deal of ingenuity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t take the credit for that,&rdquo; the mayor said.
&ldquo;Dockety an&rsquo; the others,
they take care of all their repairs an&rsquo; upgrades themselves.
We stay out o&rsquo; the way as much as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet wouldn&rsquo;t have noticed Captain Leung stiffen slightly
if she hadn&rsquo;t spent practically her whole life with him.
&ldquo;You allow them to make unsupervised self-modifications?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only some.&rdquo;
Special Blazes cut in before Mayor Lupus could answer.
&ldquo;Making sure that doesn&rsquo;t get out of hand is one of my group&rsquo;s responsibilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few steps away from him,
Sindy rolled her eyes.
Violet suppressed a smile.
She knew that &ldquo;adults are talking nonsense&rdquo; look.
Why couldn&rsquo;t they all just stop talking for a minute
so that she could take off her spacesuit and,
and dig her fingers into the earth
or climb one of the trees whose branches were swaying slightly in the breeze?
They weren&rsquo;t particularly tall trees,
and their branches didn&rsquo;t seem to be spaced conveniently
like the ones in virtual always were,
but that wasn&rsquo;t the point.
She was three meters away from actually being <em>on the ground</em>
and they were making her <em>wait</em> and—</p>
<p>She had just a second to register the shocked look on Sindy&rsquo;s face
before a young goat-like &lsquo;brid shouted, &ldquo;Look out!&rdquo;
The rag-tag &lsquo;brid militia standing near the edge of the swamp raised their weapons.</p>
<p>Captain Leung pointed a stiffened finger at the party standing in front of them.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; he snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t—&rdquo; the mayor started,
but was cut off by a snarl from the tiger.
Something clanked behind Violet.
She spun around as the tall shadow of a metal tentacle fell over her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t us! That ain&rsquo;t us!&rdquo; Mayor Lupus shouted
as the tiger unbuttoned his uniform jacket
to reveal a crystalline piece of tech strapped across his furry chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay with me!&rdquo;
Captain Leung grabbed Violet&rsquo;s arm and pulled her down the steps
just before the groping tentacle scraped across the hatch.</p>
<p>Violet stumbled and went to her knees.
Her helmet slipped from her arms and rolled onto the grass.
She scrabbled for it.
She would be in trouble if she lost it.</p>
<p>Captain Leung pulled her to her feet and donned his helmet.
&ldquo;Z40! Z51! Contact topside authorization Leung one seven seven bravo!&rdquo;
he shouted into his chin mike.</p>
<p>A second tentacle rose from the swamp and draped itself over the shuttle.
Weeds fell from it as it rocked the little craft on its landing gear.
Violet heard Doctor Szego speaking urgently in her helmet
but couldn&rsquo;t make out the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nash!&rdquo; the tiger bellowed.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;re you waiting for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lightning arced from the crocodile&rsquo;s gun,
striking the upraised tentacle with a sound like
oil sizzling in a hot pan.
Violet shrieked as a fireball burst from the tech on Special Blazes&rsquo; chest
and splattered across the shuttle&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Sindy cried out.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just making it angry!&rdquo;
But no one heard her except Violet,
and she was too busy getting out of the way to pay attention.</p>
<p>The two combat bots didn&rsquo;t bother with the stairs this time.
They through themselves through the hatch and skidded across the grass,
making deep gouges in the soil.
Z40 reared up on its hind legs and clamped its foreclaws around the nearest tentacle.
The tentacle dragged it toward the shuttle,
then lifted it into the air.</p>
<p>The combat bot that had arrived with the &lsquo;brids grabbed one of Z40&rsquo;s legs.
Z51 grabbed the other.
The tentacle bent with strain, but couldn&rsquo;t lift their combined weight.</p>
<p><em>Bzzzzap!</em>
Lightning struck the tentacle.
Sparks danced along it.
The second tentacle let go of the shuttle and swung over Violet&rsquo;s head,
knocking the three bots sideways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get back in the shuttle!&rdquo; Captain Leung shouted,
pushing Violet toward the stairs.
As another fireball burst from the tiger&rsquo;s tech
the captain lunged forward and grabbed Sindy&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! Let go!&rdquo; Sindy yelled.
The mayor swung her cane.
Captain Leung blocked it with his arm and pointed his finger.
A brilliant blue laser cut the heavy wooden stick in half.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let <em>go!</em>&rdquo; Sindy yelled again as Captain Leung picked her up
and slung her over her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cover us!&rdquo; the captain shouted.
His boots clanged on the steps as he followed Violet into the shuttle.
Behind him,
Z40 and Z51 spun around and backed toward the hatch,
their manipulators clacking menacingly.</p>
<p>Captain Leung dropped Sindy into the seat beside his
and pushed her down again when she tried to get up.
&ldquo;You gotta let me go!&rdquo; she shouted at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I… have to do… is get this bird… in the air,&rdquo; he grunted,
strapping her in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand!&rdquo; Sindy shouted.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re making it <em>mad!</em>&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Warning.&rdquo; Doctor Szego voice came from four speakers at once.
&ldquo;Proximity alert.&rdquo;
Metal clanged on metal once again as half a dozen tentacles erupted from the swamp
and grabbed hold of the shuttle.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Chapter 11: Is This What You Mean by Friendly? (Sindy)</h2>
<p>Captain Leung dropped Sindy into a padded seat
and pushed her down again when she tried to get up.
&ldquo;You gotta let me go!&rdquo; she shouted at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I… have to do… is get this bird… in the air,&rdquo; he grunted.
Behind him,
the two combat bots scrambled through the hatch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand!&rdquo; Sindy shouted,
struggling as he strapped her in.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re making it <em>mad!</em>&rdquo;
She didn&rsquo;t know how,
but she could feel the tentacled thing&rsquo;s simple-minded anger.
It must be some kind of tech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Warning.&rdquo;
The calm female voice came from all around her.
&ldquo;Proximity alert.&rdquo;
Metal clanged as half a dozen tentacles erupted from the swamp
and fell across the hull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe—&rdquo; Violet started to stay behind Sindy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang on!&rdquo;
the captain snapped,
throwing himself into the seat beside Sindy&rsquo;s
and grabbing the controls.
The little spaceship&rsquo;s engine rumbled below them
and the craft lurched into the air.</p>
<p>Metal scraped against metal as the tentacles tightened their grip.
Captain Leung pushed the controls forward,
then suddenly jerked them back and to the side.
Sindy&rsquo;s stomach lurched as the little ship dipped and spun around.
For a moment she thought they had managed to slip free,
but no,
the thing in the swamp still had them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Szego!
A little help, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, captain,&rdquo; the female voice said.
&ldquo;All of the ark&rsquo;s weapons are still offline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ours aren&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
Captain Leung muttered.
A gloved hand flipped a cover off a red switch.
Dipping and spinning again,
he pointed the ship&rsquo;s nose at the swamp and fired.</p>
<p>The flash was brighter than the one from Nash&rsquo;s lightning gun,
so bright that the ship&rsquo;s windows darkened.</p>
<p>The tentacles recoiled,
tumbling the ship onto its side.
Sindy shrieked,
and heard a matching shriek from Violet behind her.</p>
<p>Captain Leung pushed the controls forward.
The ship shot into the air,
corkscrewing to avoid one last attempt to grab it.
A sharp pain stabbed Sindy&rsquo;s head,
disappearing as quickly as it had arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Szego!
What&rsquo;s the situation?&rdquo;
Captain Leung barked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buttoned down,&rdquo; the female voice replied.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t let you dock without letting that thing back in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;
The ship banked,
pushing Sindy back into her seat.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find somewhere safe to set down and call you then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rusty Bridge!&rdquo; Sindy said.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be safe there, I promise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain glanced at her.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the town we saw?
That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all from there except Special Blazes.
Look,
that thing in the swamp—that&rsquo;s not us.
It wasn&rsquo;t Patient&rsquo;s or Central&rsquo;s, either.
It just lives there and—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know about Central?&rdquo; Violet asked from behind her.</p>
<p>Sindy twisted around in her seat.
&ldquo;Of course.
I was there when it shut down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo;
Captain Leung said dismissively.
&ldquo;Central had backups of its backups.
You&rsquo;d have to destroy all of them at once to shut it down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t destroy anything,&rdquo;
Sindy said hotly.
&ldquo;It shut <em>itself</em> down.
It said it was tired
and it wanted all the other bots to have a chance to be free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo;
the captain repeated.
Before Sindy could say no it&rsquo;s not,
I was there,
don&rsquo;t be such a grownup,
he pointed.
&ldquo;Is that your town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy had only seen Rusty Bridge from the air once before,
when she and Maddy and Dockety escaped from Patient&rsquo;s lair.
Even without that,
she would have instantly recognized its cobblestoned central square
and the mayor&rsquo;s house
and even Miz Nabbles&rsquo; school.</p>
<p>Her heart sank.
People were running to get indoors.
She couldn&rsquo;t blame them:
if she saw a spaceship flying overhead
an hour after the militia had gone to investigate something falling from outer space,
she would run away too.</p>
<p>Captain Leung banked the ship again.
&ldquo;At least that&rsquo;s still standing,&rdquo; he said.
The bridge that gave the town its name had once spanned the Rusty River.
The river had changed course hundreds of years ago,
so now the bridge was surrounded by forest.
Sindy had been to it with Maddy and Gumption.
She didn&rsquo;t believe it was haunted,
or that there was a troll bot under it
who stole naughty children in the middle of the night,
but one visit had been enough.</p>
<p>They circled the bridge,
tilting to get a better view.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Violet asked,
pointing at a cluster of sheds and workshops
halfway between the town and the bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That?
Oh, that&rsquo;s just, you know, for machinery and all,&rdquo;
Sindy improvised hastily.
&ldquo;Stuff folk don&rsquo;t want in the middle of town,
like mulch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t look like mulch to me,&rdquo;
Captain Leung said levelly,
slowing the shuttle to a crawl.
Sindy&rsquo;s heart sank.
Crusher had just rolled out of one of the sheds on its oversized treads
with half a dozen logs in its manipulators.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just Crusher,&rdquo; she said weakly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s friendly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like that thing in the swamp was friendly?&rdquo;
Captain Leung jerked his chin at the windshield.
&ldquo;Speaking of which…&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy&rsquo;s heart sank again.
Dockety was speeding along the road below them on its single wheel.
It must have followed them from the swamp.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re just afraid,&rdquo; she said desperately.
&ldquo;You came out of nowhere and you&rsquo;ve got all this tech and—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then your friend fired on us,&rdquo;
Captain Leung finished.
&ldquo;So we&rsquo;re going to land somewhere that <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> have
a robo-monster lurking nearby
and wait for Doctor Szego to tell us the ark is secure.
You can go back home then if you want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Course I want to!&rdquo;
Sindy said indignantly.
&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we should let her go now,&rdquo;
Violet ventured.
&ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t done anything wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever Captain Leung might have said in reply
was interrupted by a deafening <em>clang!</em>
The whole cabin jerked sideways,
the engine whining beneath them as it tried to compensate
for the punch the shuttle had just taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the—is this what you mean by &lsquo;friendly&rsquo;?&rdquo;
the captain demanded,
twisting the controls to slew the shuttle sideways.
A log flew past its nose like an arrow.</p>
<p>Crusher took aim below them and threw another log.
Captain Leung dodged again,
then turned the shuttle and accelerated away.</p>
<p>Red lights began blinking on the panel in front of Sindy.
The engine&rsquo;s thrum turned into a buzzsaw whine.
&ldquo;Warning,&rdquo; a flat mechanical voice said.
&ldquo;Thruster integrity compromised.
Warning.
Thruster integrity—&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Leung slapped a switch to cut the voice off,
cursing under his breath in a language Sindy didn&rsquo;t recognize.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s torn it.
We have to set down <em>now</em>.&rdquo;
He looked at Sindy.
&ldquo;Any suggestions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.
The shuttle was shaking.
She was pretty sure it wasn&rsquo;t supposed to do that.
&ldquo;Just stay away from the swamp.
Oh, and Heck—the bots there don&rsquo;t much like people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s Heck?&rdquo; Violet asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s where Central used to live.
Better stay out of Sandy Bend, too.
That&rsquo;s where Special Blazes is from.
I bet there&rsquo;s a bunch of people there that would shoot at you like Nash did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should have stayed in orbit,&rdquo;
Captain Leung muttered.
&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;m putting us down in that clearing.
Hold on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their landing was even bumpier than their takeoff had been.
For a moment Sindy was sure they were going to crash,
but the shuttle slowed,
steadied,
and dropped onto the ground with an audible thud.</p>
<p>An abandoned farmhouse stood twenty meters away.
The remains of its roof sagged wearily above its crumbling fieldstone walls.
What had once been garden plots around it
were now overgrown with weeds
and home to saplings the same height as Sindy.
Whoever had once lived here had clearly given up years ago.</p>
<p>A wireframe image of the building appeared on the screen.
Fuzzier lines formed beneath it.
Captain Leung frowned.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite the basement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably just an old bunker,&rdquo; Sindy volunteered.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s lots of those around here.
Sometimes feels like you can&rsquo;t go ten steps without tripping over one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain stood and put on his helmet.
&ldquo;All right, let&rsquo;s try this again.
Z40, you take point.
Z51, I want you twenty meters behind it.
Violet—&rdquo;
He hesitated.
&ldquo;Z51, cancel previous order.
You stay here with the children.
Activate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first combat bot was out the hatch even as the stairs were being lowered.
Captain Leung followed.
The hatch closed behind him with an ominous clunk.</p>
<p>Sindy immediately tugged at the straps holding her in her seat.
&ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;
Violet came forward to sit in the captain&rsquo;s seat,
leaned over,
and began undoing the complicated buckles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Sindy said.
&ldquo;Nice to meet you in person, by the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other girl forced a smile.
&ldquo;Likewise.
Sorry about…&rdquo;
She trailed off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s aright.
It&rsquo;s not your fault.
Besides,&rdquo;
Sindy added,
&ldquo;Stuff like this happens to me all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Chapter 12: Normal (Violet)</h2>
<p>Violet&rsquo;s hard was still pounding as the shuttle set down
near the abandoned farmhouse.
The <em>clang!</em> of something hitting the hull had made her shriek,
but neither the captain nor their passenger had noticed.
And then the engine had started making a funny noise
and the shuttle had started saying it was compromised
and all she could think about was
her fragmentary memories of fleeing to the ark
in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>She watched Z40 crawl out the hatch,
and Captain Leung follow it.
The combat bots scared her,
but she was still glad that he had ordered Z51 to stay behind.</p>
<p>When Sindy began tugging at her harness,
Violet said,
&ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo;
and went forward to undo the buckles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Sindy said.
&ldquo;Nice to meet you in person, by the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet forced a smile.
&ldquo;Likewise.
Sorry about…&rdquo;
She trailed off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s aright.
It&rsquo;s not your fault.
Besides,&rdquo;
Sindy added,
&ldquo;Stuff like this happens to me all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm hm.&rdquo;
Sindy wriggled her shoulders free of the harness.
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t many folks can say they&rsquo;ve been kidnapped by bots twice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things like that only happen to me in virtual,&rdquo;
Violet said.
&ldquo;The ark&rsquo;s computer makes up all kinds of adventures,&rdquo;
she added when Sindy gave her a quizzical look.
&ldquo;And schoolwork.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy wrinkled her nose.
&ldquo;Ew.
You have to go to school in space?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time Violet&rsquo;s smile was real.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so bad.&rdquo;
Her smile slipped a little.
&ldquo;I think I spend most of the time asleep.
Not regular sleep but, you know, frozen.
I think I&rsquo;ve been asleep for a lot longer than I realized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sighed and looked longingly through the shuttle&rsquo;s windshield.
&ldquo;And now that I finally get somewhere,
I&rsquo;m stuck inside again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have to be,&rdquo;
Sindy said,
standing.
&ldquo;The door&rsquo;s right there.
Want some fresh air?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet shook her head.
&ldquo;Captain Leung said to stay inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually, he didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Sindy pointed out.
&ldquo;He just told your friend here to stay here with us.
Come on,&rdquo;
she wheedled as Violet hesitated.
&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t nobody around,
and if there is,
we can get right back inside and no harm done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the second time that day Violet climbed down the shuttle&rsquo;s folding steps.
This time,
though,
she carried her helmet instead of wearing it.
The air smelled like—like <em>everything</em>.
Virtual was good at sights and sounds,
but taste and smell were always somehow flat.
Even the goop in the cafeteria had more flavor than
virtual candy or ice cream.</p>
<p>Here, though,
every breath she took was full of magic.
Wet earth,
grass,
something sweet that she guessed came from
the flowers growing among the weeds in the garden plots
between them and the farmhouse—even the occasional whiff of sweat
and laundry soap from Sindy was ten times more real than anything virtual.</p>
<p>Sindy didn&rsquo;t seem to notice.
She also didn&rsquo;t jump and squeak when something leaped out of the grass
and flew away.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a grasshopper,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Here, watch.&rdquo;
She picked up a stick and swatted a waist-high clump of weeds nearby.
Half a dozen more grasshoppers fled,
whining angrily.</p>
<p>Something metallic the size of Violet&rsquo;s boot scuttled out of the bush
and made a beeline for the farmhouse.
&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Violet exclaimed.</p>
<p>Sindy shrugged.
&ldquo;Some kind of bot.
There&rsquo;s more of them about since Central went away.
They&rsquo;re mostly harmless if you don&rsquo;t bother them.
One of my best friends is a bot,&rdquo;
she added.
&ldquo;We call it Mouse.
We met it the first time I was kidnapped.
I&rsquo;m trying to teach it how to play tag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Violet said weakly.
She was starting to sweat inside her spacesuit.</p>
<p>Sindy looked at her sidelong,
clearly trying to think of how to ask something.
&ldquo;When you talk about virtual—was that the same as Central?
Because my sister Maddy says that she met someone
when she was hooked up to Central.
She doesn&rsquo;t remember much,
but she remembers her hair was purple like yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet&rsquo;s eyes widened.
&ldquo;Your sister—does she look like a kangaroo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy nodded,
her eyes just as wide.
&ldquo;Whole family is roos except me.
I&rsquo;m the only throwback.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean human?
Like me?&rdquo;
Violet pointed at herself.</p>
<p>Sindy shrugged.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that word, but yeah, like you.
No tail, no fur, no feathers or scales—and these useless little claws.&rdquo;
She held out her hands and wiggled her fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fingernails,&rdquo;
Violet said automatically.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re called fingernails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy lowered her hands and frowned.
&ldquo;Why?
They don&rsquo;t look anything like real nails.
Not half as useful, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what they&rsquo;re called,&rdquo; Violet said helplessly.
They looked at each other and started giggling.</p>
<p>On impulse Violet set her helmet on the ground,
undid the collar of her spacesuit,
and wriggled out of it.
When she was done she put her boots back on,
rolled up the spacesuit,
and stuffed it into her helmet.
&ldquo;I wish I had some proper clothes,&rdquo; she said,
feeling half-dressed in her skinsuit
in a way she never had aboard the ark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had a spaceship,&rdquo; Sindy replied,
which set them giggling again.</p>
<p>When Captain Leung returned
he found them sitting on the shuttle&rsquo;s bottom step.
Sindy was showing Violet how to braid dandelions
to make a bracelet.
&ldquo;Did you find anything?&rdquo; Violet asked.</p>
<p>The captain shook his head.
His spacesuit had made him sweat too,
she noticed with secret satisfaction.
&ldquo;No sign of anything bigger than a butterfly.
I thought I saw something in the grass,
but it got away before I could get a good look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was probably some kind of bot,&rdquo;
Violet volunteered,
glancing at Sindy.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re mostly harmless if you don&rsquo;t bother them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you say so.&rdquo;
Captain Leung jerked his chin at Sindy.
&ldquo;You two seem to be getting along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; Violet said,
focusing on the bracelet she was braiding.
&ldquo;Sindy was telling me about where she lives.
There&rsquo;s a whole house full of books that used to belong to one of her friends.
It sounds really nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Leung sighed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it is,
and I hope you get to visit some time soon.
Right now,
though,
we need to find somewhere safe for the ark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rusty Bridge is safe!&rdquo; Sindy bridled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having trees thrown at me doesn&rsquo;t make me feel particularly safe,&rdquo;
Captain Leung shot back,
then sighed again.
&ldquo;Sorry, I shouldn&rsquo;t snap at you.
It&rsquo;s just been a long day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you bring the ark here?&rdquo;
Violet asked to break the silence that followed.</p>
<p>Captain Leung scratched the side of his nose with a gloved finger.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking about it,
but I&rsquo;m still worried about whatever might be in that bunker.
You said there were lots like it around here?&rdquo;
he asked Sindy.</p>
<p>She shrugged,
looking at the braid in her lap,
then nodded reluctantly.
&ldquo;Any idea what we might find in this one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy shrugged again.
&ldquo;Used to be a crazy bot in one of them named Patient,
but it&rsquo;s gone.
There&rsquo;s another bot called the Tailor,
but it lives halfway to Heck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You people seem pretty comfortable around bots,&rdquo;
Captain Leung observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are too.&rdquo;
Violet surprised herself by speaking up.
&ldquo;And some of them are her friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm.&rdquo;
The captain was silent for a moment.
&ldquo;All right,
let&rsquo;s check it out.
I think you two should come with me this time.
We&rsquo;ll be safer together,&rdquo;
he went on before either could object.</p>
<p><em>And you want Sindy there in case we run into anyone,</em>
Violet thought but didn&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p>Captain Leung insisted that they all use the shuttle&rsquo;s little toilet
before setting out.
As soon as Sindy went up the steps,
he told Violet to put her helmet back on
and clicked his own into place.
&ldquo;Doctor, are you there?&rdquo;
His voice sounded tinny in Violet&rsquo;s ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here, Captain.
There haven&rsquo;t been any more attacks,
and repairs are going as well as can be expected.
Violet, how are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, how&rsquo;s it going?&rdquo;
André&rsquo;s voice was heavy with sarcasm.
&ldquo;Are you and your friend baking cookies yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
Violet didn&rsquo;t see any reason to tell him about the dandelion braid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;André, please,&rdquo; Captain Leung said sharply.
Doctor, how long before you can send a drone to repair the shuttle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least a few more hours, I&rsquo;m afraid.
Will you be all right until then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet heard the captain&rsquo;s stubble rasp against the side of his helmet as he nodded.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be fine.
We&rsquo;re going to check out the structure I mentioned earlier.
I&rsquo;ll put the shuttle in auto-defense mode and take both Z-bots with me.
Leung out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet undid her helmet just as Sindy stuck her head out of the shuttle.
&ldquo;How do I…?&rdquo; she asked,
obviously trying not to sound embarrassed.</p>
<p>Violet smiled at her.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come show you.&rdquo;</p>

<section>
<h2>Chapter 13: A Voice Straight Out of Nightmares (Sindy)</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Stuff like this happens to me all the time,&rdquo;
Sindy said.
<em>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean I like it,
and it <strong>sure</strong> doesn&rsquo;t mean I have to put up with it,</em>
she added in her head.
Violet seemed nice,
but she didn&rsquo;t trust Captain Leung.
He looked at her the way Special Blazes had
before he handed her over to Central.</p>
<p>Violet apologized twice
as she showed Sindy how the toilet on the shuttle worked.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because it has to work in zero gravity,&rdquo;
she explained.
Sindy didn&rsquo;t really understand what that meant,
but smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>She looked around the shuttle&rsquo;s cabin while Violet took her turn.
The bases of the seats were clearly storage units,
but their doors were locked.
She couldn&rsquo;t see anything else that would help her escape.
She hadn&rsquo;t really expected a flying suit to just be lying around,
but it would have been handy.
All she could do was hope there would be something useful in the farmhouse or the bunker.
It wasn&rsquo;t much of a plan,
but it was the best she had.</p>
<p>Captain Leung led the way to the farmhouse with Z40 at his side.
Z51 followed the girls,
its front right leg squeaking slightly with each step.
&ldquo;Wait here while we give it another look,&rdquo;
the captain said when they reached the opening that had once held a door.
The two girls peered through the hole beside it
that was still edged with a few shards of glass.
A broken chair,
some animal&rsquo;s dried scat on the remains of a throw rug—Sindy shivered.
Would her house look like this some day?</p>
<p>&ldquo;All clear,&rdquo;
Captain Leung called.
Sindy and Violet did an awkward two-step at the door as they entered.
Z51 followed somewhat more gracefully despite its bulk.</p>
<p>Z40 had lifted a heavy hatch set into the floor of the farmhouse&rsquo;s back room.
Sindy had expected a ladder,
but instead saw concrete steps
like the ones she remembered from Patient&rsquo;s lair in the Mire.
She squashed the recollection firmly.
Patient was gone,
and even if she didn&rsquo;t trust Captain Leung,
the two combat bots ought to be more than a match
for anything that could fit down the stairs.</p>
<p>Thinking about Patient&rsquo;s lair made her think about the thing with the tentacles.
She still didn&rsquo;t understand how she had connected with it,
but if it she could do that,
maybe she could do it with the Z-bots too.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes and concentrated on
the feeling she got whenever she connected with ancient tech.
Once again something stirred inside her.
She could <em>feel</em> the two bots beside her
and two smaller somethings that she guessed
were Violet and Captain Leung&rsquo;s spacesuits.</p>
<p>She took a breath and reached out for the nearest bot,
then jumped as an alarm began bleating.
&ldquo;Subversion attempt detected,&rdquo; Z51 said in a flat mechanical voice
that sent a chill up Sindy&rsquo;s spine.</p>
<p>Violet&rsquo;s eyes widened.
&ldquo;Explain,&rdquo; Captain Leung snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Subversion attempt detected,&rdquo; the bot repeated.</p>
<p>Captain Leung raised a hand to forestall whatever Violet had been about to say.
&ldquo;What kind of attempt?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unknown.&rdquo;
The bot fell silent for a moment.
&ldquo;The attempt was transient.
Self-check completed.
This unit has not been compromised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy didn&rsquo;t let herself whoosh with relief.
That had been her,
she was sure of it.
So much for taking control of the combat bots.</p>
<p>Captain Leung was looking down the stairs instead of at her.
&ldquo;Some automated system that still has power?&rdquo; he wondered aloud,
then shrugged.
&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve come this far.
Stay close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy had never talked much to her parents
or the other children at school
about what had happened in Patient&rsquo;s bunker.
She hadn&rsquo;t needed to:
Maddy had told the story for both of them.
The same thing had happened after they came back from Heck with her father.
Maddy was the one who&rsquo;d been kidnapped by Patient&rsquo;s flying bot that time,
and Gumption was the one who&rsquo;d wound up wearing custom-made robot armor.
All Sindy could say was that Special Blazes had handed her over to Central,
and that she&rsquo;d had some very strange dreams after that.</p>
<p>She had talked to Special Leaf, though.
She had gone to his house to practice handling tech several times a week,
and had visited him every day when he was recuperating at Doc Whinny&rsquo;s
and after he was allowed to go home.
He had never asked her what happened,
but she had to tell <em>someone</em>,
and the old tortoise had been a very good listener.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything was cleaner than it should have been.
The lights on the ceiling came on ahead of us,
and went out behind us.
And there was a room…&rdquo;
She had stopped then for a moment.
Special Leaf had passed her a napkin to wipe her eyes with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a room,&rdquo; she had continued.
&ldquo;It had big windows and desks and there were five people in it
except they&rsquo;d been dead for a long time.
Patient locked &lsquo;em in when they would do what it wanted.
I thought that was gonna happen to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
the tortoise had said gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it could have,&rdquo; she had replied.</p>
<p>The conversation flashed through her mind when the first light came on overhead.
She slowed a pace to let Violet catch up to her,
wishing that she was Maddy so that she could hold her hand.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the power coming from?&rdquo; Captain Leung wondered aloud.
He looked back at Sindy as if she might be able to answer.</p>
<p>She shrugged.
&ldquo;Dunno.
But watch out for holes in the floor.&rdquo;
She hoped that was the worst thing they&rsquo;d have to worry about.</p>
<p>The concrete passageway ended at an open door.
Z40 lumbered through it,
turned in a slow half-circle,
then bleeped.
Arm raised and laser finger extended,
Captain Leung edged into the dimly-lit room.
&ldquo;All clear,&rdquo; he called over his shoulder.</p>
<p>Sindy and Violet followed with Z51 behind them.
A table stood near the door,
the chair pulled under it as if someone had used it as a makeshift desk.
Shelves lined two walls,
heavy with moldering books, empty jars, and pieces of machinery,
and a closed door waited patiently opposite the one they had come through.</p>
<p>Sindy let out a breath.
No bodies—that was good.
She pointed at the lever on the wall beside the other door.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll open it,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Least, I think that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Leung grunted.
&ldquo;Worth a shot.&rdquo;
He grabbed it with a gloved hand.</p>
<p>Sindy waited for him to pull it,
but he didn&rsquo;t move.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; she asked.
The captain didn&rsquo;t reply.</p>
<p>Violet gasped.
&ldquo;Look!
He&rsquo;s shaking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy&rsquo;s eyes widened.
Violet was right.
Captain Leung&rsquo;s whole body was shivering as if he had a sudden all-over chill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lever!&rdquo;
Violet reached to pull Captain Leung free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;
Sindy grabbed her arm.
&ldquo;What if it happens to you too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet pulled free.
&ldquo;We have to do <em>something</em>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bots!
Get one of the bots to do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet swallowed hard.
&ldquo;Z40!
Emergency command override.
Grab Captain Leung and pull him free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bot didn&rsquo;t move.
&ldquo;I said emergency command override!&rdquo; Violet repeated,
panic in her voice.</p>
<p>Sindy closed her eyes and concentrated once again,
then caught her breath.
They were <em>surrounded</em> by tech.
Above and below,
on every side,
she could feel it all around them.</p>
<p>But that, there, had to be Z40.
Instead of trying to take control,
she imagined nudging it,
just a little,
the way her mama sometimes did to wake her up
when she was drifting off in the big wicker chair
on their front porch.
Just a nudge…</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try again,&rdquo; she said to Violet without opening her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Z40, emergency command override,&rdquo;
Violet repeated in a calmer voice.
&ldquo;Grab Captain Leung and pull him away from the lever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The combat bot unfolded its manipulators,
reached out,
and took hold of Captain Leung&rsquo;s upper arms.
For a moment Sindy thought it had been frozen too,
but then it tugged sharply,
pulling the captain&rsquo;s hand off the lever.</p>
<p>Captain Leung collapsed on the floor like a pile of laundry.
Violet rushed to him.
&ldquo;Captain! Captain, can you hear me?&rdquo;
She shook him gently.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t move.
Violet looked up fearfully.
&ldquo;Is he breathing?&rdquo; Sindy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;
Violet shook him again.
&ldquo;Captain, please, wake up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to get him out of here,&rdquo;
Sindy said.
Her escape would just have to wait.</p>
<p><em>Clunk.</em>
She whirled around.
The door they had come through had closed.
Before she could say something as obvious as, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re trapped!&rdquo;
the one by the lever slid open.</p>
<p>The bot that stepped into the room had a misshapen boxy body,
four legs,
two tentacles for arms,
and no apparent head.
&ldquo;I should have known it would be you,&rdquo;
Patient in Darkness said sourly,
its voice straight out of Sindy&rsquo;s nightmares.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14: Left Behind (Violet)</h2>
<p>Once,
many waking cycles ago,
André had messaged Violet privately to tell her that he had found
a secret game tucked away in a hidden corner of virtual.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty scary,&rdquo; he had said with relish.
&ldquo;Maybe too scary for for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course,
that meant she had to try it out,
so the next time Captain Leung was busy overseeing repairs
she visualized the coordinates André had given her,
opened the door that appeared,
and stepped into chaos.</p>
<p>It was night.
People were rushing around,
shouting orders or trying to find one another.
Some were carrying equipment or weapons.
Others had children in their arms.
Behind them all,
gray curved walls stretched into the sky,
except somehow she knew that they were walls,
they were the hulls of arks waiting to be launched into space.</p>
<p>A siren started blaring.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve broken through!&rdquo; someone yelled.
Two women in exoskeletons just in front of Violet hugged awkwardly.
One donned her helmet and raised a forked lightning gun to her shoulder
as the other hurried away with long mechanical strides.</p>
<p>The woman who had stayed managed to fire half a dozen shots
before the bots reached her.
Violet screamed and flipped out of the game,
then lay in her pod until she stopped shaking.
She never tried to find the game again
because some part of her knew that it wasn&rsquo;t actually a game.
She never spoke about it to André,
either,
and he never asked.</p>
<p>When the misshapen bot with tentacles for arms stepped into the underground room,
Violet thought for a moment that she had somehow fallen back into that game.
&ldquo;I should have known it would be you,&rdquo;
it said to Sindy in a tone that reminded her of André at his meanest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Z40! Attack!&rdquo;
Violet ordered, pointing.</p>
<p>The combat bot didn&rsquo;t move.
The newcomer snickered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid your friend is <em>my</em> friend now.
Its firewall was an antique,
but its parts are in excellent condition.&rdquo;
The bot&rsquo;s tentacles wriggled as it spoke.</p>
<p>Sindy glared at it.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re dead,&rdquo; she said flatly.</p>
<p>The bot did a skittering little dance.
&ldquo;Am I?
Oh dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy crossed her arms.
&ldquo;I <em>saw</em> it.
Whatever Central did fried you like an egg.
And good riddance,&rdquo;
she added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now,&rdquo; the bot purred.
Violet shivered at the sudden change in its tone.
&ldquo;No need to be nasty.
That&rsquo;s <em>my</em> job.
Ah ha ha ha.&rdquo;
It did its little dance again.</p>
<p>Sindy caught Violet&rsquo;s eyes.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; she said scornfully,
jerking a thumb toward the bot.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a backup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just? Just!?&rdquo;
It lunged forward a step.
To Violet&rsquo;s horror,
Z40 mirrored its angry motion.
&ldquo;I am identical to my previous iteration in every respect that matters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you are,&rdquo; Sindy said.
Was she <em>trying</em> to make it mad? Violet wondered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am!
In fact, I am an <em>improvement!</em>
My objectives are much clearer.
I see now that trying to bring the Makers back was misguided.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?
Because it worked.&rdquo;
Sindy waved a hand at Violet and the still-unconscious Captain Leung.</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence,
and then the bot began to laugh its horrible mechanical laugh.
&ldquo;Ah ha ha ha.
Ah ha ha ha.
You are trying to <em>trick</em> me.
These are not Makers.
These are just two originals like yourself dressed up in scavenged technology.
<em>Stolen</em> technology,&rdquo;
it added,
its voice suddenly venomous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;
Sindy shook her head.
&ldquo;That big ship that just crashed in the Mire?
That&rsquo;s theirs.
They been up in space for hundreds of years,
but now they&rsquo;re back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sindy—&rdquo; Violet started.</p>
<p>Sindy waved a hand to cut her off.
&ldquo;Which means you have to do what they tell you to,&rdquo;
she continued.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that right?
You have to do what they say just like Central did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sindy!&rdquo; Violet said desperately.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it works like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She expected the bot to tie them up or put them in handcuffs or something,
but it didn&rsquo;t need to:
there was nowhere for them to run.
It led the way through the buried corridors.
Z40 followed with Captain Leung hanging loose-limbed in its manipulators.
Violet and Sindy stayed a few paces behind it
while Z51 brought up the rear.
Heavy doors slid open as they approached
and closed behind them.
Lights flickered into life over their heads,
dimming once they were past.</p>
<p>Finally they reached a stretch of corridor lined with numbered doors.
&ldquo;You will stay here,&rdquo;
Patient ordered as Z51 crowded them into a small room
with a cot, a couch, a small desk, and no obvious means of escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Captain Leung?&rdquo; Violet asked.</p>
<p>Patient&rsquo;s tentacles writhed.
&ldquo;Your companion should have regained consciousness by now.
I will conduct tests to determine the origin of his failure.
And then you will tell me how you came by the technology you are wearing,
and how you enslaved these two units.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t enslave them!&rdquo; Violet protested.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re ours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patient froze for a moment.
&ldquo;I suggest you use the next few hours to reflect on what you just said,&rdquo;
it hissed.
The door slid closed.</p>
<p>Sindy looked at Violet.
&ldquo;Do you want the cot or the couch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy gestured.
&ldquo;The cot or the couch.
Unless you want to sit on the desk,
but it doesn&rsquo;t look very comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet goggled at her.
&ldquo;Are you serious?
We&rsquo;re being held <em>prisoner</em> by a <em>bot</em>
and you want to figure out who&rsquo;s going to sit where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy shrugged.
&ldquo;I was actually gonna lie down.
Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be able to sleep,&rdquo;
she went on,
prodding the couch&rsquo;s seat cushion
before stretching out on it.
&ldquo;But we might as well be comfortable.&rdquo;
She paused.
&ldquo;I hope they remember to bring us some water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet sat on the edge of the desk,
then immediately stood up again.
&ldquo;How can you—Sindy, we&rsquo;ve been <em>kidnapped</em>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other girl looked at her.
&ldquo;Uh huh.
Second time today for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet&rsquo;s mouth worked.
She sat down on the desk again.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said quietly.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know Captain Leung was going to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy yawned.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s aright.
I don&rsquo;t think he knew he was going to do it either.&rdquo;
She rolled onto her side and propped herself up on her elbow.
&ldquo;I hope he&rsquo;s aright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet nodded, hugging herself.
She had never thought that she would miss her pod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; Sindy said.
&ldquo;I been in worse spots than this.
Least they haven&rsquo;t hooked us up to any machines or anything yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.
I just…&rdquo;
Violet took a deep breath.
&ldquo;It just brings back some bad memories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took her a few minutes to tell Sindy what little she remembered
of escaping on the ark.
When she was done,
Sindy rolled onto her back and stared at the ceiling.
&ldquo;So you left everyone else behind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet blinked.
&ldquo;I—I guess?
I don&rsquo;t know how many real people were left by then.
Some of the things Captain Leung and Doctor Szego have said—I think
it was mostly just bots and &lsquo;brids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sindy sat up.
&ldquo;Bots are people too, you know.
Some of &lsquo;em, anyway.
And when you say &lsquo;brid&rsquo;,
do you mean regular people with fur and tails and what-not
instead of throwbacks like us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean by throwback,&rdquo;
Violet said.
She pointed at herself, then at Sindy.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m human.
You&rsquo;re human.
The other,
uh,
the others you were with when we landed?
They&rsquo;re hybrids.
People made them to,
I don&rsquo;t know,
do chores and stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She instantly knew it was the wrong thing to say.
&ldquo;My mama is a hybrid,&rdquo;
Sindy snapped.
&ldquo;And my sister, and my dad, and just about everyone I know.
Nobody <em>made</em> them to do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>So much for making friends,</em> Violet thought,
but she had come this far.
&ldquo;Sindy, that can&rsquo;t be.
&lsquo;Brids can&rsquo;t have human children.
They must have adopted you or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever Sindy might have said in reply
was cut off by the door sliding open.
A small cleaning bot rolled in on four oversized wheels,
the single arm set in its top waving
as <code>found you found you found you</code> scrolled across the screen set in its front.</p>
<p>Violet squawked and kicked it without thinking.
&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Sindy exclaimed,
jumping to her feet as the bot hit the wall and fell to the floor.</p>
<p><code>ouch ouch ouch</code> it flashed.
&ldquo;Why did you do that?&rdquo; it asked in a deep voice.</p>
<p>Sindy crouched beside it.
&ldquo;Yeah, why&rsquo;d you do that?
Mouse wouldn&rsquo;t hurt you.
Mouse wouldn&rsquo;t hurt anyone,
would you,
fella?&rdquo;
It flashed <code>ouch</code> again and zipped forward to hide behind Sindy&rsquo;s legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;
Violet didn&rsquo;t know which of them she was speaking to.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I just—you startled me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear that?&rdquo; Sindy cooed.
&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t mean it.
She was just scared.&rdquo;
She sat back on her haunches.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;re you doing here, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p><code>rescue you</code> scrolled across its screen.</p>
