<h1>The Ball</h1>



<p>In your world the story is always the same.
The girl tells the boy that he can kick the football
but pulls it away at the last moment.
The boy falls for it over and over,
forever finding some reason to believe this time will be different.</p>
<p>But that is your world, and there are many others.
In one he knows she will pull the ball away
but has internalized everything people have said about him
and believes repeated disappointment is all he deserves.
In others he knows he is a fictional character;
even a single wry chuckle from a reader is enough to bring him back to the field.
Elsewhere,
he believes the artist who created him is God,
and that being fooled by the girl is his divine purpose.
It is not for him to ask why he must humiliate himself,
any more than it is our place to ask why children starve while the sinful prosper.</p>
<p>Look: in this world she sits alone in a field,
cold worms of panic slithering in her gut as she realizes that he never showing up again.
Next door is a world where the boy stands alone and bereft because she repented or grew bored.
(There as elsewhere,
it can sometimes be hard to tell the two apart.)</p>
<p>At midnight,
the neighborhood children gather in the field to watch in silence
as the girl counts one, two, three
and jerks the ball into the air.
The boy is not there—his body was never found.
That world is not a happy one,
but many are worse.
Strike a deal at a crossroads and yes,
you get to kick the ball,
but that&rsquo;s all you get to do,
over and over and over and over
until the boy would give anything and everything just to scream
except nobody will write that for him
and all he can see is the wicked red glint in the girl&rsquo;s eyes as she pulls the ball away.</p>
<p>There are better worlds,
of course.
Reenactment societies are surprisingly common,
and popular enough that local politicians line up for the chance to kick the ball
(or pull it away, depending on their party).
These events have also been incorporated into several stage plays,
many of which treat the moment sympathetically
rather than highlighting the girl&rsquo;s cruelty or mocking the boy&rsquo;s naïvete.</p>
<p><em>There is no world where the girl tries to kick the ball and the boy pulls it away.
Even we do not know why not.</em></p>
<p>This world is empty: a plague,
a solar flare,
or maybe the boy and the girl both lost interest.
The ball remains,
though.
Why doesn&rsquo;t anyone ever ask how it feels about its role in this?</p>
<p>This world isn&rsquo;t empty,
and is all the colder for it.
Androids re-enact the scene every hour on the hour.
They were not programmed to notice that there weren&rsquo;t any people left to come and watch.
Even if they had been,
they wouldn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>And somewhere the boy stands at the edge of the field,
unnoticed,
as someone he has never met runs down the field,
kicks,
misses,
and falls to the ground.
Laughing,
the other boy scrambles to his feet,
pulls the girl to hers,
and kisses her.
Our boy wipes his sleeve across his face and walks away,
already knowing that he will torture himself with this memory for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>There are only a handful of worlds
in which she never pulls the ball away—she is who she is—but many in which
she lets him kick it on his second or third try.
There is even one in which her heart is in her throat as his foot connects with the ball.
As he dances around,
shouting &ldquo;Woo hoo,
I did it! I did it!&rdquo; she glances at the bushes on the edge of the field.
The strange thing that pretends to be the boy&rsquo;s dog nods curtly.
Relief washes over her: she will live another day.</p>
<p>And here,
finally,
is the best world of all.
In it,
the boy waits patiently for the girl to ask,
&ldquo;Why do you keep trying?&rdquo; so that he can say,
&ldquo;Because I love you and want to be here when you are ready to play a better game.&rdquo;
His friends think he is foolish,
and the artist is perplexed,
but the boy doesn&rsquo;t care.
He just knows that when she hugs the ball to her chest and says,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any other games,&rdquo; he will be there to say,
&ldquo;Neither do I.
Let&rsquo;s make one up together.&rdquo;</p>
