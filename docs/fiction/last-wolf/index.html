<h1>The Last Wolf</h1>



<ol id="toc"></ol>

<p>Part I</p>
<p>He walked into my father&rsquo;s camp as the sun rose one spring morning. We
had seen him coming, of course. My grandfather muttered that anyone
without the courtesy to wait for an invitation should be turned away,
but my father said no.</p>
<p>When the stranger pulled back the hood on his parka my father almost did
send him away. He looked like a monster. His hair was yellow, and his
face was all nose and beard. He smiled and said something in a strange
language, then laughed when we spoke to him in our own.</p>
<p>By the time summer came, he and I were learning to wrestle from my
father. That is how Saknus Heraldsson came to the Anuat.</p>

<p>We spent four years together, Saknus and I, learning to wrestle. We
captured and sacrificed small birds or field mice, and then used their
bones to command their little spirits before setting them free. Once I
persuaded my brother to trap a lynx for us. We called its spirit back to
do small magics for several days, until my grandfather found out and
beat me.</p>
<p>In the winter nights Saknus told us stories, laughing at his mistakes as
he learned our language. He told us of the south, of his home, of great
camps that never moved, of more people than he could name. Every story
led him to a question, and every answer led him to another. My
grandfather often grumbled that it was no good teaching the monster, he
had no ancestors, but my father ignored him. Many other shamans came to
visit my father and his strange pupil, and from each of them I think
Saknus learned a little more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To work strong magics a shaman must have strong spirits to help him.
Our ancestors are angry when they are called back from the Forever
Summer. We must wrestle with them to make them obey us. Only in this way
can we make magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saknus smiled when my father said this, as though at a joke that only he
had heard. &ldquo;Can you only summon your own ancestors back to wrestle?&rdquo;
he once asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; my father replied. And it was true. When other shamans visited
I borrowed their necklaces-of-bones, and tried to summon their
ancestors. But there was never an answer to my calls.</p>
<p>When my grandfather finally died my whole family fasted for two days.
With the proper rituals we cut off his thumbs, then set the rest of his
body out on a stone to share with the birds. My mother emptied the
stew-pot and boiled the thumbs until the meat was gone. Then my father
took the bones and went away from camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is wrestling my grandfather,&rdquo; I told Saknus, proud of knowing
something that the clever monster did not. &ldquo;He will defeat his
father&rsquo;s ghost, and then tie the thumbs to his necklace-of-bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is with those bones that he calls his ancestors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;That is the only way anyone can do it. Every
summer a shaman must make a magic to tie his spirit to his bones for
another year, so that if he dies his spirit can be found and wrestled.
Every shaman swears to do this, so that his children and their children
will have magic. If a shaman sees many summers and does this magic many
times his grandchildren&rsquo;s grandchildren might still be able to wrestle
with him. My grandfather,&rdquo; I added proudly, &ldquo;Lived a very long life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saknus smiled. My brother Nataqqunaq scowled then, as he often did
around the big-nosed man. We were twins, but he had taken to hunting as
I had taken to the shaman&rsquo;s ways. He would say little when the monster
spoke, and soon left a tent if Saknus entered. We had been closer than
friends before Saknus came. It hurt me that we grew apart in those
years.</p>

<p>Saknus had been with us four summers when he destroyed us. When the sun
was so strong that it shone all night, the Anuat gathered to trade, to
arrange marriages, and to welcome their new shamans. There was much
singing and dancing, and many games as young men strove to impress
sceptical fathers and giggling girls.</p>
<p>Nataqqunaq, my brother, easily defeated the other men at running and
spear-throwing . I did not compete. I was preparing to receive the
tattoos of a shaman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have sadness for you, &rdquo; I told Saknus one day. &ldquo;You have no ghosts
to wrestle. You will never be a shaman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled. After four years, he still showed his teeth when he did this.
&ldquo;Perhaps I will find another way, Sikuliaq,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The stars are
such as they have not been in many years. Perhaps I can find another
way.&rdquo; And then he laughed at his joke, and I laughed with him.</p>
<p>I went out across the tundra the next morning with my father and two
other shamans. Things were done, and words spoken, and I returned that
evening with three small X&rsquo;s on each cheek, and a tooth from my
grandmother&rsquo;s grandfather on a cord around my neck. The magic that held
his spirit to that piece of bone had faded so much that my father would
otherwise have crushed it and fed the fragments to the sea, to give the
old man his final peace.</p>
<p>When we returned, we found people gathered around the field in the
center of the camp. &ldquo;The monster is going to show us a new game,&rdquo; my
uncle told me.</p>
<p>Saknus had drawn a great, complicated pattern with sand in the middle of
the field. It was a star with five points, and many circles inside and
out. An unlit torch stood at each point. He saw me and smiled, then
raised his arm into the air.</p>
<p>Suddenly his hand was covered with flame. The people around us oohed and
aahed as Saknus brought his hand down to each of the torches in turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said he could not wrestle,&rdquo; Nataqqunaq accused my father. &ldquo;How
does he do this?&rdquo; My father shook his head, his scowl mirroring my
brother&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>All the torches were lit. Saknus allowed the fire on his hand to flicker
out. Then he closed his eyes, and let hell loose upon us.</p>
<p>My uncle, who was standing beside me, screamed and fell to the ground.
He clutched his throat, fighting for air. A dim form sat astride him,
something with too many arms and smoking holes where its eyes should be.
It strangled him, then pounced like a lynx on another victim. There were
more screams around me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s killing us!&rdquo; my brother shouted, and threw his spear toward
Saknus. It flew as straight as an arrow, but faltered on the edge of the
pattern in the earth and fell uselessly to the ground.</p>
<p>My people ran from the field as their hunters and shamans fell, one
after another. I did not. Sworn only that day, I was still a shaman.
With all my strength I called to my one weak ancestor as the other
shamans had called to theirs, but no spirits could batter through the
wall Saknus had built.</p>
<p>Finally there was no-one left but me. I stood there with the tears
freezing on my face. Saknus opened his eyes, and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Sikuliaq,&rdquo; he greeted me, stepping out of his magic circle as
though it did not exist, ignoring the corpses that lay around him.
&ldquo;Good. Very good. You are going to help me now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spirit hands closed round my throat.</p>

<p>I woke to find myself lying on cold stone. My hands and feet were bound.
As my eyes began to focus, I recognized my surroundings from legends I
had heard as a child. Above my head the mountain was a perfect dome.
Beneath me, the floor was as smooth as fresh ice. A glowing ball floated
in mid-air. By its light, on his knees, Saknus Heraldsson was carefully
painting a pattern on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they will be so surprised,&rdquo; he was saying. &ldquo;So surprised when I
come back and destroy them and their stupid College.&rdquo; He examined his
work closely, then licked his thumb and wiped at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monster,&rdquo; I whispered.</p>
<p>He appeared not to hear. &ldquo;Three hundred years since there were such
stars, and they don&rsquo;t have the nerve to use them,&rdquo; he went on,
painting. &ldquo;Oh no, not them. But I do. I am going to work such magic as
has not been seen since those days. Such a beautiful magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monster,&rdquo; I said again. This time, my voice was louder. &ldquo;This place
is sacred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up. &ldquo;Oh, good, you&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo; He smiled. &ldquo;How is your
head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ghosts of our shamans will drag you down and feed you to the Great
Whale,&rdquo; I cursed. &ldquo;You will never rest, not now or in the spirit
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo; He gestured behind him. &ldquo;I have all their
necklaces-of-bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled again. &ldquo;Real magic can do a lot that your people don&rsquo;t know
about, Sikuliaq. With what your father taught me, and what I already
knew, it won&rsquo;t be difficult to summon every ghost your people have ever
had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; I asked, betrayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; He seemed to take the question seriously. &ldquo;Well, I want to
trap a god&mdash;a demon like the ones I called up at the camp, only much
larger. And I&rsquo;ll need a lot of strength to wrestle with it. Your
ancestors are going to give me that strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a traitor.&rdquo; I tried to spit.</p>
<p>He laughed. &ldquo;Oh, certainly. But a successful one.&rdquo; Suddenly the smile
was gone. &ldquo;Now be quiet.&rdquo; He gestured, and I could no longer speak.</p>
<p>It took him the rest of that day, and most of the next, to finish his
pattern. He gave me water, when he remembered, but no food. By the time
he was ready I was weak and light-headed. He laid me out on the stone
slab in the center of the cave, and stripped off my parka and boots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you may be wondering about your role in our little play,&rdquo; said
Saknus. I had heard my father use that tone of voice when talking to
small children as he set a broken bone. &ldquo;Well, I need something to
offer my guest to get its attention. And that, my friend, is what you
are going to provide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He painted a pattern on my forehead, and spoke some words. I suddenly
felt heavier than iron. He watched me for a minute, then placed the two
boxes containing our necklaces-of-bones on either side of me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That spell will prevent your spirit from running away,&rdquo; he explained,
examining in turn each portion of the painted pattern. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll bring
more and more of himself into this world, trying to get at you through
that pattern. And when he&rsquo;s all here, I will command your shamans to
reach out through the circle and&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He trailed off, frowning. &ldquo;Although I suppose I could make things a
little easier.&rdquo; He drew a knife from his belt, reached across my bound
form, and cut open my throat.</p>
<p>I felt hot blood run past my ears. As my sight misted Saknus stepped
back outside the pattern, and began to chant.</p>
<p>I heard his voice, louder and louder. A cold wind blew from nowhere,
carrying with it a stench like all the rot the world had ever made.</p>
<p>And then there were voices. Anuat voices, my grandfather&rsquo;s and others
that I knew, so many that I did not, chanting with Saknus, louder and
louder, building towards a climax. I suddenly knew that something was
behind me, coming closer, something infinitely worse than the shadows I
had glimpsed at the camp.</p>
<p>Saknus and I screamed at the same instant. My vision cleared. I lifted
my head and painfully turned it in his direction. Saknus was lying dead
on the floor, outside the pattern, with a spear through him. Nataqqunaq
was standing at the entrance to the cave, calling my name.</p>
<p>Somehow I managed to stand and stumble past Saknus. The air crackled
around me as I left the pattern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must flee!&rdquo; shouted my brother. I took a few steps, leaning
heavily on his arm, then stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;The necklaces. I must get the necklaces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stumbled back to the pattern, but I could not enter it. And it was
then that I understood what had happened to us. I told Nataqqunaq to
try, and he could not enter the pattern either. I would have wept, but
the dead cannot weep.</p>

<p>We died all winter the year Saknus Heraldsson took our magic from us. No
one could call the seals to the hunt, so the people starved. No one
could heal the sick and injured, or keep the Great Whale away.</p>
<p>And no one could break Heraldsson&rsquo;s magic and let me die.</p>
<p>The first ship of Garheimmen arrived in the spring. Someone at
Heraldsson&rsquo;s old college had felt his spell, and sent soldiers and
magicians to search for the traitor. We fought them, and slew many, but
their iron swords and fire spells were too strong for us.</p>
<p>I stole books and learned spells to hide the pentacle in the mountain
from the eyes of their magicians. It was not enough. The Garheimmen had
seen furs, and gold in the rivers. They came back the next year, and the
next, bringing the coughing sickness and the bleeding sickness and
whisky.</p>
<p>So I swore an oath with my brother, and drew maps, and learned to be
patient.</p>
<p>Part II</p>
<p>Luft Berendsson had given up cursing the cold by the time he reached the
shack at the end of the Ax Medicine&rsquo;s one street. He pulled the door
shut behind him, then clomped down three planked stairs into the
shack&rsquo;s one sunken room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said three, and I meant three!&rdquo; Settling back on his stool, the
trader nodded a curt hello to the newcomer. Luft crossed the packed
earth floor to the pit stove and pulled off his mitts.</p>
<p>The Anuat put the knife back on the counter and shouldered his pack.
&ldquo;Three blue seal furs are enough for a hand of such knives,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Good weather.&rdquo; He pulled the hood of his parka over his long dark
hair and left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weeping, freezing muck.&rdquo; Despite his words, the trader did not
actually sound angry. &ldquo;No liquor, no magicians, and nothing to eat but
seal blubber. No weeping wonder they bargain like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luft shrugged back his own parka&rsquo;s hood and sat down on the edge of the
sturdy wooden counter. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like our native friend, then?&rdquo; Luft
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s not that.&rdquo; The trader noted his companion&rsquo;s much-broken
nose and matted blond beard, and the well-worn handle on the sword slung
outside his parka. &ldquo;Why, these three years gone, when ice locked the
harbor early, we&rsquo;d have starved, most of us, if not for Walker and his
folk. But&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walker? The local chief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, that was him just here.&rdquo; The trader nodded toward the door as
Luft picked up a string of beads and ran them through his fingers.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s as much a chief as the wild ones have. Best hunter of the lot,
and that&rsquo;s good enough for them. But as I was saying&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good hunter, eh?&rdquo; Luft dropped the beads back on the table.
&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, blind your eyes,&rdquo; the trader said after the other man had left.
&ldquo;You might at least have closed the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Torvald Argusson was well into his third beer when he heard his name
called. He squinted through the smoke in the tavern&rsquo;s belly, then waved
at the two men approaching him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, Luftie,&rdquo; he boomed. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luft sat down beside his partner. &ldquo;This is Walker, Vald,&rdquo; he explained
excitedly. &ldquo;He says he&rsquo;s been out to the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Argusson gently pried the younger man&rsquo;s fingers from his arm. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t drink when you do that, Luftie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Have a seat, Walker.
Karl! Karl, get these men some beer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; Walker said quietly, looking at the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No? Well now, you&rsquo;re the first person I&rsquo;ve met here to turn down a
drink.&rdquo; Argusson took two mugs from the servingman, passed one to Luft,
and set the other one next to the flock of empties in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been into the Bentfathers, then?&rdquo; When the Anuat nodded
Argusson belched and wiped his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, that&rsquo;s good. Luft and I want to get out there and back before
the harbor freezes. That gives us, oh, two weeks, perhaps. Just straight
up the river into the foothills, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is better hunting west,&rdquo; Walker commented after a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that, I know.&rdquo; Argusson glanced at his partner and cleared his
throat. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not looking for furs, I&rsquo;ll tell you that much. Five
crowns for the trip, two of them now if you want. Luftie and I already
have a sled and some reindeer. We could get tack tonight, and leave
tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Garheimmen looked expectantly at the Anuat, who continued to study
the table. Finally Luft snorted. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not up to it, then, do you
know someone who is?&rdquo; He drained his mug and let it thump to the table.</p>
<p>Walker studied the table a moment longer, then raised his eyes.
&ldquo;Tomorrow at the gate,&rdquo; he agreed.</p>
<p>The older man smiled widely. &ldquo;Good, my friend, good!&rdquo; He reached
across the table to clap the Anuat on the shoulder. &ldquo;At first light?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walker, who was already rising, nodded. But as he lifted his pack to his
shoulder someone shoved him from behind. A rough voice demanded, &ldquo;Why
are you here?&rdquo; Walker turned around slowly to face the fat Anuat who
was unsteadily behind him. &ldquo;You go back the cold you belong,
<em>pauetsitgualuk</em>! Nobody want you here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somebody shouted, &ldquo;Twenty crowns on Big Goose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; Luft shouted back.</p>
<p>Walker threw the small Garheimmen a glance, letting his pack slip off
his shoulder as he did so. Without apparent effort he grabbed the fat
Anuat by the collar, lifted him, spun around, and threw him hard to the
ground. The drunk landed heavily. As he struggled to rise, Walker kicked
his supporting arm out from under him. The fat man groaned once, then
lay still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good job, Walker!&rdquo; Luft laughed. &ldquo;Hey, you! Where&rsquo;s my twenty
crowns?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you all right, Walker?&rdquo; Argusson asked anxiously.</p>
<p>The Anuat nodded. &ldquo;Tomorrow at the gate. Dream well,
Not-Hunting-Furs.&rdquo; He picked up his pack. &ldquo;Good night, Little
Hunter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The infuriated Luft started to rise from his chair, but Argusson pulled
him down. &ldquo;Little hunter my eyes!&rdquo; Luft fumed, staring murderously at
the Anuat&rsquo;s retreating back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come on, Luftie, he meant nothing by it.&rdquo; Argusson raised one
hand in the air and twisted it, saying a word as he did so. Two steins
of beer lifted themselves off the servingman&rsquo;s tray and floated over to
their table. A few patrons stared, and one made a warding sign. At the
door, Walker watched them briefly, then left.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old one is a magician, then. Good. But what of the yellow beard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know, my brother. The big-noses say we are small, but he is
less than a boy of twelve summers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful of him, my brother.&rdquo; The night was a dark shell, flecked
here and there with stars like chips of ice. An owl hooted softly as it
floated over the trading post&rsquo;s garbage heap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid, my brother.&rdquo; A moment&rsquo;s silence. &ldquo;Must I go with
them? In four hands of days the seals will come. I spoke with
Quaraaluktuq of hunting together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be done, my brother. Laugher will hunt next year.&rdquo; The owl
hooted again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blind his eyes, where is he?&rdquo; Luft began pacing again. &ldquo;The sun&rsquo;s
up soon, the reindeer will want to be fed in a few more hours&mdash;where&rsquo;s
our precious weeping snow-for-guts guide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luft, would you sit down?&rdquo; The older man was sitting on the back of
the sled, wrapping and unwrapping the traces around his hands. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
show. He said first light, so maybe he meant&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should do this on our own.&rdquo; Luft packed a snowball and threw it
against the log palisade that encircled the trading post, then stooped
to crush more snow between his hands. &ldquo;I told you when we got here, we
could do this ourselves. Why the muck do we need somebody else?&rdquo;
Another snowball smashed against the wall.</p>
<p>Just then Argusson spotted a dark blot approaching the palisade gate.
&ldquo;Eh, Luftie, he&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; he said, struggling to his feet inside a
double layer of furs. &ldquo;Hello, Walker, good weather!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blot resolved itself into the Anuat&rsquo;s solid bulk. A head shorter
than the older Garheimman, the hunter was wide across the shoulders and
waist. His young face was the color of old driftwood, and was almost
lost in the black wolverine fur that lined the hood of his parka. A
small pack on his back, a pair of skis, and two spears were his only
gear.</p>
<p>He nodded a greeting when he reached the Garheimmen, then placed his
skis on the snow. &ldquo;My brother says the river ice is good from here to
the mountains,&rdquo; he said as he lashed his pack onto the sled. &ldquo;He says
no-one is there now.&rdquo; He moved forward to the sled traces. The reindeer
snuffled and nuzzled his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already checked those,&rdquo; Luft said sharply. The Anuat continued
to pull and twist the leather straps, making minute adjustment and
re-tying knots. The younger man looked angrily to Argusson, only to be
shushed with a handwave.</p>
<p>The Anuat made a last slight adjustment to the length of a trace, then
stood, satisfied. &ldquo;Maybe four, maybe five days to the mountains.&rdquo;
Smiling suddenly, he added, &ldquo;If the weather is good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He strapped on his skis as carefully as he had tested the traces, then
picked up his spears, reversed them, and pushed. With a shout and a
whipcrack Argusson followed on the sled. Last of all came Luft, his
sword on one hip, skiing in the tracks the Anuat had made.</p>

<p>The little trading post called Ax Medicine disappeared behind a white
hill and was soon forgotten, as they lost themselves in the weary
monotony of travel. Around them the first snowfall of late summer had
smoothed the tundra, turning long gravel eskers into frozen white waves,
broken here and there by islands of rock. A solitary tern paralleled
their path for a time before turning south.</p>
<p>By unspoken consent, Walker stayed out front. His steady heave, heave,
heave on his makeshift ski-poles lulled his companions into silence.
Seated on the sled, Argusson pulled a small flask from a pocket of his
parka. He drew the cork with his teeth, then took a long swallow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walker!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Time to make camp!&rdquo; The horizon had long
since covered the dull copper coin that was the Arctic sun. They went
another half-mile before Walker stopped, satisfied with the meager
protection offered by a small hollow. The Anuat stood his skis and
spears together in the snow as Luft came forward to the sled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ewwwrrrr&hellip;&rdquo; The younger Garheimman stretched and yawned. &ldquo;I ache
all over. Set up the tents, Walker, I&rsquo;ll see to the reindeer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walker pulled a small shovel off the sled and began to scoop out a patch
of snow. As the Anuat erected their tents, Argusson planted five stakes
in a circle round the camp. He was stringing the stakes together with
frayed red cord when he became aware that Walker was watching him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is anything wrong, Walker?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The Anuat scowled. &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Argusson shrugged. &ldquo;A warding spell. If anyone crosses it during the
night, or tries to do magic across it, I&rsquo;ll know. It&rsquo;s just a
precaution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Anuat grunted, then returned to work. Argusson continued to knot the
cords together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be well, my brother. He is not strong enough to do it, or I
would feel him now. I do not think he can do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why must I go with them, my brother?&rdquo; His voice was angry. &ldquo;If he
cannot do it&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you swore an oath, my brother. As your father my brother
swore, and as your grandfather and his father all swore.&rdquo; My own voice
was only a whisper. After he returned to camp, I repaired the
magician&rsquo;s spell.</p>

<p>It was late on the fourth day when Walker found the tracks. He was in
front, as he had been since they started, and moving at a steady tempo.
Suddenly he swerved to one side, then stopped. The magician reined in
the reindeer and slipped his flask back in his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Walker, what&rsquo;s the problem?&rdquo; he asked, clambering unsteadily
off the sled. The Anuat had pulled his boots from his skis and was bent
nearly double, intently examining the snow beneath him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Luft asked, untying the straps on his skis. Argusson
shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, lad. Walker?&rdquo; The reindeer nuzzled each other,
panting, grateful for an opportunity to rest.</p>
<p>The Anuat remained hunched over, walking slowly back and forth. Finally
Luft said, just loud enough for their guide to hear, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably
found himself spoor from some flat-faced pig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Anuat straightened. &ldquo;Men Without Names,&rdquo; he said quietly, still
looking down. &ldquo;Outcasts. On foot. Maybe one hand, maybe more, two days
ago. Going north.&rdquo; He looked ahead, then back at the two Garheimmen.</p>
<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s silence, then Luft spat. &ldquo;You said nobody would
be around,&rdquo; he taunted. &ldquo;Weeping good guide you&rsquo;ve turned out to
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luft! Hold your tongue.&rdquo; The magician took a deep breath. &ldquo;Do you
think they&rsquo;re close, my friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Anuat shook his head. &ldquo;Two days ago. And there is no hunting, not
here. They will be gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another moment of silence, then Luft laughed unpleasantly.
&ldquo;Right. Weeping right. First nobody&rsquo;s here, and now they&rsquo;re two days
gone. I suppose we&rsquo;ll be cooking for them tonight, eh?&rdquo; He spoke as if
it was a personal triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are two days gone from here.&rdquo; For the first time Argusson heard
emotion in the Anuat&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;You will not cook them supper tonight,
little man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you not to call me that, you weeping blind-eyed son of a sow!&rdquo;
Luft knocked away Argusson&rsquo;s arm and strode toward the guide. &ldquo;You
weeping well apologize!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Anuat stared in the direction they had been traveling. &ldquo;We will
keep going north,&rdquo; he said calmly. &ldquo;It is not wise to rest the
reindeer without feeding them, friend Torvald.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apologize, you pig!&rdquo; Luft ran the last two steps and swung a
roundhouse punch at the guide.</p>
<p>Walker brought his spear out of the snow as the Garheimman yelled. He
blocked the punch easily, then twisted the spear to club Luft in the
head. The smaller man hit the snow and rolled to his feet with his sword
in his hands. The Anuat reversed his spear and braced himself.</p>
<p>A sudden flash blinded them both. Someone howled at the magic dazzle,
but Argusson couldn&rsquo;t tell if it was his partner or their guide. The
reindeer brayed furiously.</p>
<p>When Luft&rsquo;s vision cleared he was sitting in the snow, his sword still
in his hand. His head ached. He saw the magician quieting the reindeer,
and the Anuat standing a few yards away with his hands over his eyes.</p>
<p>Argusson looked directly at Luft. &ldquo;Serves you right,&rdquo; he said shortly.
&ldquo;Walker! Are you all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Anuat slowly lowered his hands, then nodded. There were tears on his
cheeks. He looked at Argusson for a long instant, then stooped to pick
up his spear. &ldquo;We should go,&rdquo; he said, and returned to his skis.</p>
<p>As the magician helped him to his feet, Luft hissed, &ldquo;We can do this
ourselves, I told you. Get rid of him now&mdash;we&rsquo;re going to have to do
it later anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, pig-eyes!&rdquo; The magician glanced at Walker, then gripped
Luft&rsquo;s parka and pulled him close. &ldquo;We need him. Just remember the
gold, and keep out of his way. Now get into your skis and get moving.
The sooner we&rsquo;re there, the better for us both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Minutes later the trio was moving north again. The magician busied
himself with his own thoughts. Under his breath, in counterpoint to the
steady rhythm of the skis, Luft cursed the Anuat guide.</p>

<p>The mountains were no older than the rest of the world, but they seemed
weary beneath their load of ice and snow. The sun was as high in the
south as it was going to get when Walker said that it was time to leave
the sled behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today, walking, will bring us to your place,&rdquo; the Anuat said as Luft
and Argusson sorted through their gear. &ldquo;The reindeer will stay near
the sled. Do not leave them food&mdash;they will find moss under the snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luft said something under his breath, then shouldered his own small
pack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready when you are, Vald. Let&rsquo;s get up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Argusson stuffed more vials and pouches into his parka, then
double-knotted the drawstrings at his wrists. &ldquo;That should do it.
Ready, Walker? Right, then, and off.&rdquo; With Walker in front, and Luft in
the rear, the three men began walking.</p>
<p>I waited until they were out of earshot, then made a quick search of
their sled. There was nothing I could use. The reindeer snorted or
brayed, according to temperament, then fled.</p>
<p>There was no path, but a narrow ledge wound up the mountain. In places
it was wide enough for a camp. Elsewhere, it vanished against the
mountainside, forcing the men to scuttle sideways with their hands and
feet scrabbling through the crust on top of the snow. Gray stone rose or
fell sharply on either side of them.</p>
<p>Walker climbed steadily, pausing occasionally to let the others catch
up. Luft moved with dogged determination, never looking directly at the
Anuat. Argusson, who had fallen behind, heaved great gusts of steam.
Neither of the Garheimmen noticed the darkening sky until they felt the
first flakes of snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weeping frozen muck,&rdquo; cursed Luft, as Argusson dropped his weight
onto a convenient ledge and gulped the frozen air. &ldquo;Would have been
better if I&rsquo;d stayed in the castle waiting trial, maybe, instead of
following you and that damned old map of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The magician shook his head. &ldquo;Better cold than dead,&rdquo; he panted.
&ldquo;Almost there. Come on, Luftie. The cave, should be, just, a little,
further. Give us, a place, to rest.&rdquo; He struggled to his feet. &ldquo;Just a
few more hours, lad.&rdquo; He almost sounded as if he were pleading.</p>
<p>By the afternoon the storm was so thick they could see only an arm&rsquo;s
length in any direction. Walker was a dozen steps ahead of the others,
testing the snow with the butt of his spear, and Luft was reaching back
to help the magician when high-pitched war cries split the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ware yourself, Vald!&rdquo; shouted Luft, pulling his sword free as a
parka-clad man dropped to the path ahead of him. The Garheimman dropped
to one knee to dodge a spear thrust. As his attacker pulled back for
another Luft cut viciously at the spear&rsquo;s haft, chopping at his
opponent&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>Another man dropped to the path behind the first. &ldquo;Yeaaaaaaah!&rdquo; Luft
howled. He knocked aside his opponent&rsquo;s spear and slammed into him,
pushing him back into the second man. All three went down in a heap.
Luft rolled to the side, almost sliding off the path, and cut backhand.
He felt his sword hit flesh, and pulled it free as he scrambled to his
feet. A single body lay on the pathway. Scuffed snow showed where the
other man had slid down the mountainside into the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luft! It&rsquo;s me, Luftie, it&rsquo;s me.&rdquo; The magician had pulled off his
mitts and was anxiously scanning the mountain. &ldquo;They must&rsquo;ve climbed
up to that ledge, there, and been waiting for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The berserker rage was ebbing out of the smaller man. Redfaced, he
shouted, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your weeping almighty favorite muck-wallowing
blind-eyed traitor guide, I want to know!&rdquo; Droplets of blood scribed a
delicate arc in the snow as he waved his sword. &ldquo;They were waiting for
us, well, were they now? One guess who let them know we were coming!&rdquo;
He kicked the corpse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walker!&rdquo; Argusson shouted, then waited. &ldquo;Walker, are you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Luft laughed hysterically. &ldquo;Did I tell you! Led us right into a trap,
your weeping smug flat-faced friend. Shut up, Vald!&rdquo; the small man
shouted as Argusson filled his lungs to call again. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone, isn&rsquo;t
he? And good riddance, I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Argusson slumped. He stared at the dead man, who was already shrouded in
fresh-fallen snow. &ldquo;We need him, Luftie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; demanded Luft. &ldquo;What in hell can he do that I can&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Argusson met his eyes reluctantly. &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he finally said. &ldquo;Come
on, we&rsquo;re almost there.&rdquo; The younger man wiped his blade on the
corpse, but did not sheath it as they resumed their climb. Around them,
my storm thickened.</p>

<p>Walker was worried when he felt the first snow. There had been no sign
of a storm that morning. He was almost relieved when he heard the
war-cries. A bandit dropped onto the path, feinting a high lunge. As
Walker parried the blow with his spear a second body landed on his back
and carried him off the path.</p>
<p>He fought like a lynx as they fell, the rocks punching him as fiercely
as the Nameless Man. Somehow he lost his spear in the snow. He pulled
for the knife at his belt, but the bandit clutched his arm with one hand
and punched him again with the other.</p>
<p>They slipped over a lip of rock and came to their feet in a snowdrift.
Walker drew his knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, my brother!&rdquo; I whispered. He froze.</p>
<p>Piqaluujaq slid to a stop above the small cleft in which we were hidden,
then jumped down beside me. &ldquo;Illaujaq is dead,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The short
one killed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walker&rsquo;s face was rigid with rage. &ldquo;You have betrayed me,&rdquo; he said
tightly. &ldquo;You are no more my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would have sighed. &ldquo;Be easy, brother,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;You are with
friends.&rdquo; Behind me stood a half-dozen Men Without Names. All but one
had a spear or bow aimed at my great-grandnephew.</p>
<p>Liar!&rdquo; he snarled, and leapt at me. To the others, it would have seemed
as fast than lightning. I had time to decide once again not to kill him,
catch his arm, and throw him to the ground.</p>
<p>As he glared up at me I tsked and said, &ldquo;And I swore I would make you a
great chief. Sitilluqaq! Are they there yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shaman closed his eyes. He was weak, as they all were now, with so
few spirits to wrestle, but was the best I could find. He fondled his
mother&rsquo;s thigh gingerly. &ldquo;Someone says no,&rdquo; he said, careful not to
name her as they wrestled. &ldquo;They are still climbing. The angry one
hopes to fight. The wrestler&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not a wrestler,&rdquo; I interrupted. &ldquo;What he does is different,
and better. Rest.&rdquo; Sweat steamed off the skinny old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Piqaluujaq! Give me your parka.&rdquo; The bandit disrobed, shivering. Even
for us, the day was cold. I reversed the parka before I put it on. With
the white fur lining outermost, I was almost invisible against the snow.
&ldquo;I will go now,&rdquo; I told them. &ldquo;Agiuppinniq, you will wait here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate you,&rdquo; he said, and meant it. &ldquo;My great-grandfather should
have killed you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would have laughed. I stuffed the mitts into the tops of my boots, and
began to claw my way up the snow-covered rock bare-handed.</p>

<p>My storm was raging by the time the two Garheimmen located the mouth of
the cave. For a few moments I was afraid they would walk past it,
blinded by snow and fatigue, but the short one shouted and pointed. They
squeezed through the narrow entrance. I counted to a hundred in
Garheimmen, then followed.</p>
<p>They had dropped their packs and food at the entrance. I wished briefly
for a sense of smell so that I could tell if they had torches, but it
would not matter. I put Piqaluujaq&rsquo;s mitts back on my hands, then
pulled the hood of the parka forward to cover my features. I stepped
quietly into the cave I had visited a hundred times in as many years.</p>
<p>Finally I came to a small widening in the passage where the floor
leveled off. It was dimly lit by reflected light from the main chamber
directly ahead. I moved forward on silent feet.</p>
<p>Above them, the domed roof of the cave was as smooth and round as a
seagull egg. The short one held up a blazing torch while they surveyed
the chamber. Under their feet, in faded colors, the remnants of an
elaborate pattern were still barely visible. At its very center, between
two wooden boxes, stood a slab of stained stone. A little further away,
mummified by the cold, lay the long-dead body of a man with a spear
protruding awkwardly from his back.</p>
<p>Argusson gestured with his thumb. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Heraldsson, for certain. I
guess he annoyed the flat-faces a bit much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you get through it?&rdquo; Luft asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo; The magician pulled something from a pouch, then knelt
and began to draw.</p>
<p>I edged forward, then stopped. I could not get close enough to see what
he was doing without exposing myself. I would have cursed, but he might
have felt that.</p>
<p>Finally Argusson got back on his feet. &ldquo;Give me your torch,&rdquo; he said.
Luft handed it to him. &ldquo;And your sword.&rdquo; At Luft&rsquo;s quizzical look the
magician added, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s steel,&rdquo; as if that were an explanation. He laid
the sword on the floor of the cave. &ldquo;Now, kneel there. No, more to the
left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Propping the torch against the wall, Argusson added more detail to the
circle that surrounded his kneeling partner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, keep your eyes on those boxes. When they start to glow, you rush
in and grab them. That&rsquo;s got to be Heraldsson&rsquo;s treasure, for sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they glow. Right, let&rsquo;s be done.&rdquo; Luft sounded eager. Argusson
shook his head.</p>
<p>The magician began to chant in a language I did not know. I felt power
stirring at his command. Hunkered down on the floor, Luft kept his eyes
on the wooden boxes. Argusson&rsquo;s voice grew louder, more commanding.
Suddenly he shouted three words, then again, and again. As he shouted he
swept up the sword and swung it over his head and down into Luft
Berendsson&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>There was a sudden surge of power as the pentacle broke. Luft&rsquo;s body
lay crumpled on the painted floor. As the torch flickered and died I
could hear the magician sobbing. I felt&mdash;cheated. I had studied stolen
texts for more than a century. Not a one had even mentioned the
possibility that sacrificing a man might break the pentacle.</p>
<p>Argusson fumbled with the torch. The flickering light steadied as the
flame gained strength. Sword still in hand, Argusson stumbled forward
into the broken pentacle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no gold,&rdquo; I whispered. He shrieked and spun on his heel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; He looked about wildly. &ldquo;Name yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stepped into the light, keeping my head bowed. &ldquo;There is no gold,&rdquo; I
repeated. &ldquo;There never was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; He looked older at close range. His grizzled head
seemed to be shaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holder. Sikuliaq. Walker&rsquo;s brother, and great-granduncle.&rdquo; I took
another step toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my map&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made that, and sent it south. I needed someone who could break the
spell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Argusson stepped back and stumbled over a wooden box. He knocked the lid
off with his sword, then rummaged crazily through the contents. I was
halfway across the floor.</p>
<p>Then he lifted his head to look at me. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just bones,&rdquo; he
whispered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not gold at all. You mean I&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Nothing but bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He choked, then shouted, &ldquo;Yeeaaaaah!&rdquo; and threw fire at me. I parried
it easily with the Garheimman magic I had taught myself. As I began a
spell of my own he raised the sword and charged.</p>
<p>I feinted to the left, then stepped back and leaned into his lunge. The
sword slid easily through the parka, through my chest, and out my back.
Argusson screamed in terror as the hood fell back from my rotted
features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too late,&rdquo; he heard me whisper as my fleshless hands closed around
his neck.</p>

<p>Sitilluqaq made a warding sign when I came back down the mountain with
the necklaces-of-bones around my neck. Agiuppinniq wore a new bruise on
his cheek, and limped. One of the Men Without Names had a fresh splint
on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have won,&rdquo; I whispered to them. &ldquo;We have our magic back. Walker!
You are going to be a chief now. You are going to be the greatest chief
Anuvatik has ever known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spat at me. &ldquo;You betrayed me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You betrayed us all. We
are no more brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would have laughed. &ldquo;Your great-grandfather said the same thing when
he first saw my throat open to the wind,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;But I made him
chief over all the people. I made his son a great chief, and his son
your father, and now I will make you the greatest of chiefs. You will
lead our people against the big noses. You will push them back into the
sea, with their diseases and their drinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not do this!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>I wore all the magic of my people around my neck. For a moment I let him
see their ghosts standing around me, bound to their bones as
Heraldsson&rsquo;s spell had bound me forever to mine, unable to leave this
world, any of us, unable to find the final peace for which we yearned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will,&rdquo; I promised him in a whisper. &ldquo;They will call you chief,
and bring you gifts. And they will learn to call me king.&rdquo; A sharp wind
blew through my bones. Around us, the soft white snow lay silent on the
ground.
\&lt;!======================================================================&gt;</p>
<p>Part III</p>
<p>Between Garheim and the mountains is the Herd of Trees. When the
Clockwork Kings drew maps, they drew it as part of their empire, but few
of them ever ventured into its depths, or challenged the might of the
great bull sequoias that ruled over it. The sky fell on the Clockwork
Kings, but the seasons came and went as they always had. Trees drove
their roots deep into the earth, and wrestled slowly with each other for
sunlight. They dropped their pinecones on the ground, and waited for the
glaciers to come and drive them south again.</p>
<p>It took Tahura and her companions almost three days to cross the Herd.
They touched down only once, on a small, rocky island called the Drowned
Man&rsquo;s Fiddle. The trees had never crossed the lake that surrounded the
island, so travellers could light fires and sleep in safety. Fat Andre
gave some books, a toy kaleidoscope, and a large crock of blackberry jam
to the family of gifted beavers whose dam kept the lake full, then sat
up late into the night telling them about the goings on in the world
outside. Tahura ate, slept, and then mounted her cloud and followed the
others eastward at dawn the next day.</p>
<p>The Herd mingled at its edge with mundane trees, dumb oaks and silent
elms, which in turn slowly gave way to fields grazed flat by sheep.
Stone cottages with thatched roofs appeared, and then a scattering of
farms. Bright green cabbages lay alongside dark green beans and an
occasional orange scattering of pumpkins. A pair of herons flew parallel
to the clouds for a while, then angled away toward a short,
sturdy-looking watchtower that squatted on a nearby hilltop. Tahura
wondered idly if they were border guards, or just puzzled by the sight
of so many clouds, so far east, so late in the season.</p>
<p>The farms below them were eventually shouldered aside by busy little
market towns, which grew larger as they approached the coast. Cart
tracks became planked roads that flowed into the great paved highways
that the Clockwork Kings had laid down from one end of Cherne to the
other. Tahura saw couriers in blue and silver coats on swift horses race
past enormous wagons drawn by teams of eighteen oxen, while barges
stacked with rolled-up carpets, barrels of beets, and sacks of mountain
rice floated slowly toward the capital.</p>
<p>And finally they saw the capital, Garheim-in-Garheim itself, with its
six bridges and four castles, its canals and markets and broad avenues.
A hundred ships lay at anchor in its harbor&mdash;round-hulled fishing
skerries and flat-bottomed timber barges, three-masted tea traders from
Barra Bantang and high-prowed warships flying Garheim&rsquo;s blue-and-silver
flag. Looking at it all, Tahura felt for a moment that if someone had
set her whole village down in one corner of the city, it could have gone
unnoticed for a week.</p>
<p>A crow flew up to meet them as they passed over the river. He fluttered
around the lead cloud for a moment, then landed on Fat Andre&rsquo;s
shoulder. Tahura saw Fat Andre nod as the crow gave him directions, and
then tap Miguello on the shoulder and point out a small courtyard at the
rear of the castle below them. As their cloud began to descend, Tahura
mind-spoke to Cloak and ordered her to follow. She spent the last
minutes of her week-long voyage imagining how good it was going to feel
to wash herself in hot water.</p>
<p>A small group of men and women in blue and silver were waiting for them
when they landed on the courtyard&rsquo;s polished, pale granite flagstones.
The clouds touched down in ones and twos, so that their riders could
dismount, then lifted off again to make room for the others. As Fat
Andre slid down off the cloud he and Miguello had been riding, one of
the Garheimmen functionaries stepped forward and made a slight bow. He
was shaped like a barrel, and had a close-cropped gray beard and balding
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greetings,&rdquo; he said in a deep, smooth voice. &ldquo;Greetings, and welcome
to Garheim-in-Garheim. I am Toll Invesson, Deputy Steward of Angvesund
Castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May t&rsquo; sun shine clearly on all you do,&rdquo; Fat Andre responded, bowing
in turn. The skinny mountain trader&rsquo;s fleece-lined leather coat looked
poor and plain next to the steward&rsquo;s rich cloak, but his smile seemed
to Tahura to be much more genuine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Toll said, bowing slightly once again. &ldquo;I trust your
journey was an easy one?&rdquo; Without waiting for Fat Andre to answer, he
turned and gestured at his companions. &ldquo;My people will show you and
yours to your rooms, if you wish. We have set beds in the Merchant
Travellers&rsquo; Wing, on the second floor. Your clouds are of course
welcome to stay near the palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;T&rsquo;ank you,&rdquo; Fat Andre said. He turned to the cloudherds. &ldquo;Ev&rsquo;body
got t&rsquo;eir t&rsquo;ings? An&rsquo; clean socks for t&rsquo; mornin&rsquo;? A&rsquo;right t&rsquo;en.&rdquo;
He turned back to Toll and smiled again. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll follow you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They passed two guards in brightly-polished armor as they followed Toll
out of the courtyard, through a tall, narrow archway, and into the
castle proper. &ldquo;I imagine you must be quite excited,&rdquo; Tahura heard
Toll say to Fat Andre as they walked across another, smaller courtyard.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recall ever hearing of anyone taking clouds so far north.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure,&rdquo; the trader replied easily. &ldquo;I wish I were goin&rsquo;. Used
t&rsquo; listen t&rsquo; stories about t&rsquo; icebergs an&rsquo; bears an&rsquo; all when I
were little. Be a t&rsquo;ing, t&rsquo; see &lsquo;em for m&rsquo;self.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going yourself?&rdquo; Toll asked, sounding surprised.</p>
<p>Fat Andre shook his head. &ldquo;If t&rsquo;ey take me, t&rsquo;ere&rsquo;s one less room
for one of yours, and you&rsquo;re payin&rsquo; me by t&rsquo; head.&rdquo; He pointed his
thumb back over his shoulder without turning his head. &ldquo;Beside which,
t&rsquo;ey can do everyt&rsquo;ing t&rsquo;at needs done, an&rsquo; leave me t&rsquo; run my
business here while t&rsquo;ey&rsquo;re gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure whether&mdash;&rdquo; Toll began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a&rsquo;right, I had a friend at t&rsquo; T&rsquo;eatre look at t&rsquo; contract.&rdquo;
He stopped in his tracks to fish a folded-up piece of paper out of the
pocket of his heavy coat. The people behind him had to pulled up short
to avoid running into each other. There were muttered apologies from the
cloudherds, and elegantly bowed heads from the Garheimmen, as Fat Andre
opened up his prize and handed it to Toll. &ldquo;He read t&rsquo; last few verses
of t&rsquo; contract twice over,&rdquo; Fat Andre said smugly, &ldquo;t&rsquo;en said t&rsquo;at
if I didn&rsquo;t want t&rsquo; go nort&rsquo;, I didn&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tahura couldn&rsquo;t help but grin. The skinny man had been trading in the
mountain villages since before Tahura was born. He had gone from owning
a single mule, a single pair of boots, and two battered old saucepans to
running a messenger service that criss-crossed half of Cherne, but he
still seemed to enjoy nothing more than saving a few pennies, or
haggling over the last few verses of a contract.</p>
<p>Toll glanced at the note, then re-folded the note neatly along its
creases and handed it back to Fat Andre. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s in order,&rdquo;
he said smoothly, &ldquo;Although not being a lawyer myself, I would not be
able to judge. Now, please, your rooms are this way.&rdquo; The little party
set off again.</p>
<p>Tahura could have found her way blindfolded through the mountains she
had grown up in. She could navigate across the Nine Marches using only
the stars as guides, or taste the smell of cooking on the wind and tell
if the town below her was in Former Leyselle or Latter Leyselle. Despite
all that, she was soon hopelessly lost as Toll led them up one flight of
stairs, down a longer one, through an arched corridor that bent left,
then right, along a gallery with a dozen identical mirrors hung on each
side, across another courtyard in which serious-looking children were
being taught how to fence, and then through a pair of thick oak doors
and into the Merchant Travellers&rsquo; Wing of the palace. One last flight
of stairs took them up to the second floor, where handful of servants in
blue and silver were waiting in a neat row.</p>
<p>An hour later, Tahura was sitting with her fellow cloudherds on
something that Fat Andre called a &ldquo;couch&rdquo;, sipping hot mint tea and
wondering whether Garheim needed a full-time cloudherd. Her room as
large as the one-room house that she shared with her mother in
Marandine, and had a real glass window. Instead of a bath, she had been
shown to a sauna. She and Miguello&rsquo;s twin sister Miguella had sat
gasping while the steam washed the cold out of their bones, then wiped
themselves dry with scented towels and dressed. Tahura was glad that her
mother had insisted that she buy a new pair of dark gray pants, and
bring the embroidered shirt that she normally wore only on festival
days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;pass it on the second reading,&rdquo; Toll was saying. &ldquo;If Balance
Petcharatiriv had not already arrived, I&rsquo;m sure some of the Empty
Throne would have voted against it, and your journey would have been for
nought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fat Andre nodded. His smug look was gone. &ldquo;Did t&rsquo;ey vote any more ties
or restrictions on t&rsquo; delegation?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Toll shook his head. &ldquo;No, although some were proposed.&rdquo; He smiled
apologetically. &ldquo;I apologize if I&rsquo;ve given you cause for worry over
this. The whole matter seemed to have been resolved months ago, but some
fishermen from Sinheim had their nets cut, and&hellip;&rdquo; He turned his hands
palm-up in his lap, as if to shrug.</p>
<p>Fat Andre did shrug. &ldquo;My fat&rsquo;er used to say, it ain&rsquo;t so bad lyin&rsquo;
awake at night if you&rsquo;ve got coin t&rsquo; count.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toll smiled politely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure your father was a wise man.&rdquo; He rose
smoothly from his chair. &ldquo;I will greet the sun with you tomorrow,&rdquo; he
said to the room as a whole. &ldquo;Your servants will bring dinner to your
rooms, or serve it here, as you wish.&rdquo; Then he turned to Tahura and
added, &ldquo;His Highness Evan of Ensworth has asked me to inquire whether
you would like to dine with him this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh oh,&rdquo; Miguella said under her breath, but Tahura just shook her
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No thank you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long trip, and I think I just
want to get some sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The steward bowed his head once more, then left. As soon as the door
closed, Miguella said, &ldquo;&lsquo;Has asked me to inquire&hellip;&rsquo; Well, butter
wouldn&rsquo;t melt in <em>his</em> mouth, would it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The steward&rsquo;s, or the prince&rsquo;s?&rdquo; her brother asked with a wicked
grin. &ldquo;Seems to me that His Harness is&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put a cork in it,&rdquo; Tahura said flatly. She had been afraid that
Prince Evan would be there when they landed, then angry when he wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Miguello opened his mouth to make another dig, but his sister elbowed
him in the ribs. &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; he protested, raising his mug of tea so that
it wouldn&rsquo;t spill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; Fat Andre roared. &ldquo;If you spill anyt&rsquo;ing on t&rsquo;ose
pillows, it comes out of your pay!&rdquo; He glared at them for a moment,
then slid down slightly amidst the down-filled cushions of his chair.
&ldquo;Bad enough t&rsquo;ey can&rsquo;t sort out t&rsquo;eir own politics,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t need a bunch o&rsquo; ducklings makin&rsquo; trouble too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tahura sat and watched the fire as the conversation turned to other
things. She was the last to finish her tea, but the first to leave the
small gathering for her room.</p>

<p>She wasn&rsquo;t really surprised by the knock on her door an hour later. The
moon was up. She had been sitting on a little bench in the window bay
with her knees drawn up under her chin, watching the clouds circle the
palace slowly in the silvery light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she said tiredly.</p>
<p>She heard the door handle turn and click. The door itself opened without
a sound on its oiled hinges. &ldquo;Tahura?&rdquo; Prince Evan stepped hesitantly
into her room. &ldquo;Am I bothering you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; she said without looking away from the window.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just really tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the steward said.&rdquo; The prince half-closed the door, then
stood awkwardly for a moment, waiting for her to speak, before stepping
over to the bed and sitting down on one corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was your trip?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; she said distantly. She closed her eyes and turned her head
toward him, resting her cheek on her knee. &ldquo;But I really am tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prince Evan could feel his heart thumping as if he&rsquo;d just run up three
flights of stairs. &ldquo;Are you still mad at me?&rdquo; he blurted.
&ldquo;Because&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not mad at you,&rdquo; Tahura said. She opened her eyes and looked
straight into his. &ldquo;Really.&rdquo; She closed her eyes again.</p>
<p><em>Well, you sound like you&rsquo;re mad,</em> the prince thought, but what he said
was, &ldquo;How&rsquo;s your mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s fine. She&rsquo;s working for Fat Andre now too. She&rsquo;s just about
the oldest rider he has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not that old, is she?&rdquo; the prince asked.</p>
<p>Tahura sighed. &ldquo;No, but a lot of grown-ups still don&rsquo;t want to do
anything except sell rain to farmers. Do you remember Pedro? Eduardo&rsquo;s
brother? He&rsquo;s still reeve in Porandine, and he said that anyone who
worked for Fat Andre wouldn&rsquo;t ever be allowed to join the Porandine
herd again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But aren&rsquo;t Miguello and Miguella from Porandine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tahura opened her eyes and stared at the prince. &ldquo;How did you know
that?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>The prince shifted uncomfortably. &ldquo;Fat Andre had to give the Clear
Light a list of all the cloudherds that were coming on this trip.
Balance Petcharatiriv heard about it, and asked for a copy, and&hellip;&rdquo; He
shrugged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A list of&mdash;&rdquo; Tahura was almost speechless. &ldquo;You mean the Garheimmen
are spying on us? What did it say about me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not spying,&rdquo; the prince said hastily. &ldquo;They just wanted to
know who would be coming, and where they were from, and some of the
other places you&rsquo;d all been, and&hellip;&rdquo; He shrugged. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just
worried, that&rsquo;s all. It was hard enough getting everyone to agree to
negotiate in the first place. The last thing they need is for something
to go wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo; Tahura demanded. &ldquo;What could we do wrong? We&rsquo;re just
supposed to get everyone there and then bring them back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the prince said helplessly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did it say about me, anyway?&rdquo; Tahura interrupted. She felt the
same helpless anger that she had felt in Colway the summer before, when
someone had upended her pack and gone through her things while she was
bathing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; the prince protested. &ldquo;Just where you were born, and that
your father used to travel with Andre, and that you&mdash;you used to visit
Ensworth every summer.&rdquo; He looked away from her blazing eyes. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
all I remember, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmph,&rdquo; she snorted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty good at not remembering things
sometimes, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that supposed to mean?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know exactly what it&rsquo;s supposed to mean.&rdquo; Tahura swung her legs
around so that she was sitting up on the bench. Her hands gripped its
edge on either side of her. She could feel its unvarnished underside
with her fingertips. &ldquo;You <em>didn&rsquo;t remember</em> to mention Lady Gracelle
in your letters for a whole year!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you said you weren&rsquo;t still mad at me,&rdquo; the prince replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not mad!&rdquo; Tahura snapped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just&mdash;oh!&rdquo; She twisted around
on the bench to put her back against the wall of the bay and pulled her
knees up under her chin once again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just really tired,&rdquo; she said
more quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And anyway,&rdquo; the prince continued, as if she hadn&rsquo;t spoken, &ldquo;It
wasn&rsquo;t a year, it was just a few months. And I would have told you if
I&rsquo;d known you were coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why it was such a big surprise,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;I came
to see you three summers in a row.&rdquo; <em>I&rsquo;m not going to cry,</em> she told
herself grimly. <em>I&rsquo;m not!</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; the prince replied. &ldquo;You know what the worst part
was? Sophie. She was so mad, she wouldn&rsquo;t let me play with her dolls
for weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?&rdquo; Tahura asked bitterly. &ldquo;Or
maybe I should feel sorry for Lady Gracelle&mdash;she must have been just as
surprised as I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince hesitated, then shrugged miserably. &ldquo;Not really,&rdquo; he
admitted. &ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t a lot of secrets at the palace. Even if no-one
else told her, her mother probably did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great,&rdquo; Tahura replied. &ldquo;First half of Ensworth knows that I&rsquo;ve
made a fool of myself, and then Fat Andre writes it down so the
Garheimmen can share the joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tahura&hellip;&rdquo; The prince couldn&rsquo;t keep the exasperation out of his
voice. &ldquo;Nobody was making any jokes. And I don&rsquo;t think the Clear Light
care whether we&mdash;whether you used to come and visit me. I just&mdash;I just
want to be friends again, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I just want to get some sleep,&rdquo; Tahura said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a long
three days.&rdquo; She laid her cheek on her knees again so that she could
watch the clouds circling overhead.</p>
<p>The prince took a deep breath, then thought the better of whatever he
had been about to say and let it out with a whoosh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he
said quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you in the morning.&rdquo; The door opened silently
on its freshly-oiled hinges, then closed with a click. His boots went
<em>clop, clop, clop</em> down the hallway.</p>
<p>Tahura watched the clouds a few moments longer, until they and
everything else went blurry. She sniffled once and wiped her eyes on the
knees of her pants, then got up wearily and went to bed.</p>

<p><em>Far away, north and north again, a small boat bobbed gently up and down
at anchor at the mouth of a narrow, rocky stream. Even now, near the end
of summer, patches of snow still lurked among the rocks where the pines
cast their shadows at noon.</em></p>
<p><em>The boat&rsquo;s captain, who was also its only passenger, sat on the stern
gunwale. He dabbled his toes in the icy water as he drank the last of
his tea, not feeling the cold. A hooded owl floated above the trees
behind him. He smiled at the rapid tubba-tubba of her heartbeat, and the
rustling of her feathers, then up-ended his mug and dipped it in the
ocean to rinse it.</em></p>
<p><em>Swinging his legs back into the boat, he stowed the mug beneath his
seat, then hauled briskly on the spider-silk ropes that raised the
boat&rsquo;s single sail. Another rope raised the anchor, and then a deft
touch on the rudder turned the boat about and took her out into the open
ocean. He smiled as the boat rolled gently over the passing waves. He
had many miles to cover before dawn, and many more after that to reach
his destination, and he was looking forward to each one. He had
discovered long ago, not long after he died, that looking forward to
things was the secret to a long, happy life.</em></p>

<p>Prince Evan woke the next morning to a gentle tapping on his door. He
lay beneath the heavy blue-and-silver quilt for a few moments, his eyes
open but his mind still far away. The sky outside his window shone gray
with pre-dawn light. For a few moments he remembered that he had been
dreaming about his journey through the Blight, except that somehow he
was traveling with his father, and not Sergeant Alastair. Then he woke
all the way up and forgot his dream, as he had forgotten it many times
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he called in answer to the <em>tap-tap, tap-tap</em> on his door. The
tapping stopped. A moment later the door opened and a servant stepped
into Prince Evan&rsquo;s room carrying a silver basin filled with hot water,
a small pot of soap, and a freshly-sharpened razor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Your Highness,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I trust you slept
well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you,&rdquo; the prince replied. He sat up and stretched, tnen
pushed back the quilt and stood up to dress.</p>
<p>He paused for a moment to look at himself critically in the mirror when
he was shaved and fully clothed. The gray jacket and dark red
ankle-length skirt that he had worn since becoming Balance
Petcharatiriv&rsquo;s apprentice looked sombre against his dark skin. The
servant&rsquo;s small lantern cast bright highlights on the prince&rsquo;s
freshly-shaved scalp. He could see it reflected as two bright spots in
his eyes. He brushed a loose thread off his shoulder, then turned and
went to greet the sun.</p>
<p>The great courtyard on the east side of the castle was already half full
when he arrived. Four hundred or more people of all ages were gathered
there: stewards and errand boys, lawyers and ladies&rsquo; maids, boot
polishers, blacksmiths, clerks, copyists, and all the rest of the
castle&rsquo;s staff. Those who were in the service of the Empty Throne wore
Garheim&rsquo;s blue and silver colors. The rest were dressed in forest
green, honey brown, crimson, saffron, and dozens of other colors whose
name the prince could only guess. He saw turbanned traders from the
pirate kingdom of Barra Bantang, and an old woman from Karaband in a
brightly-striped silk robe, whose false beard reached to her waist.</p>
<p>After a moment, he saw the cloudherds as well. They were standing in a
little knot, attended by an equal number of Garheimmen servants. Fat
Andre was muttering instructions to them out of the corner of his mouth.
Tahura was wearing a cream-colored serape with blue-and-red embroidery
around its edges. The prince remembered it from her last visit to
Ensworth. He tried to catch her eye, but a hundred bells had begun to
ring all across the city. He straightened up and took his place in line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up there. No, no, just a couple of steps,&rdquo; Fat Andre hissed. The
cloudherds shuffled forward until they stood shoulder to shoulder a few
paces behind the line that had formed so smoothly in front of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now hold hands,&rdquo; Fat Andre told them. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t move until I tell
you to.&rdquo; As Tahura took Miguella&rsquo;s right hand in her left, she felt
someone take her right hand in a warm, solid grip. She glanced sideways.
The Garheimmen standing beside her was her own height, with short blond
hair, a neatly trimmed beard and mustache, and the bluest eyes she had
ever seen. She smiled at him uncertainly. He grinned and winked back at
her, giving her hand a squeeze, then turned to look forward.</p>
<p>A stern-faced man had stepped up onto the podium at the front of the
courtyard. A squad of soldiers stood behind him in armor. Half carried
silver-headed lances, while the rest had crossbows with silver-headed
arrows. The sky had gone from gray to blue, while the few wisps of wild
clouds high above them had gone from pink to snowy white.</p>
<p>The bells stopped ringing just as a bright sliver of sun appeared above
the low eastern wall of the castle. In the sudden silence Tahura could
hear the flags above the castle snapping in the cold morning breeze.
Sunlight crept down the wall to her left, then across the courtyard&rsquo;s
floor. Each person held their hands high for a moment as the light
touched them. Tahura kept her gaze on the stout man in front of her as
Miguella lifted and lowered her left hand. When she felt the sun&rsquo;s
warmth on her forehead she raised both her arms, took three slow
breaths, and let them drop.</p>
<p>Almost immediately the man beside her lifted her hand again. She glanced
at him again, and saw that his grin had gone solemn. His eyes were
closed, and his head was tilted back slightly, as if he were basking in
the morning light. Finally he sighed and let his arms fall, with
Tahura&rsquo;s hand still in his warm, firm grip.</p>
<p>It took ten more minutes for the sun to touch all of the people
assembled in the courtyard. Finally, when everyone had raised and then
lowered their arms, the steward standing in front of the crowd raised
his own. &ldquo;I say all gathered here to greet the sun are truly made,&rdquo; he
pronounced. &ldquo;Does any here say otherwise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No-one spoke. &ldquo;Then give thanks for the clear light,&rdquo; the steward
continued. &ldquo;May it keep you safe from darkness, and those who dwell in
darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May it keep you safe also,&rdquo; the crowd murmured in response. The young
Garheimmen standing beside Tahura gave her hand a final squeeze and let
go. His grin was back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You must be Tahura and Miguella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m&mdash;,&rdquo; Miguella said, just as Tahura said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.
Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Garheimmen bobbed his head slightly. &ldquo;Arne Larsson, at your
service.&rdquo; He waved a hand at the crowd of people around them, who were
filing back into the castle through five different doors. &ldquo;What did you
think of the ceremony?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was nice,&rdquo; Tahura said. &ldquo;But it must be very cold in
the winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Garheimmen nodded. &ldquo;Mm hm. When it&rsquo;s really cold, most people wait
until mid-day. It&rsquo;s only in the summer that we ask our guests to get up
this early.&rdquo; He grinned again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of a special treat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tahura found herself grinning back. &ldquo;Oh really? My mother used to try
to get me to eat broccoli by telling me that it was candy in disguise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arne chuckled. &ldquo;Did you ever believe her?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only once,&rdquo; Tahura told him. &ldquo;And then I wouldn&rsquo;t eat real candy
for weeks in case it turned out to be broccoli.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know our names, anyway?&rdquo; Miguella cut in. &ldquo;We only got
here last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arne&rsquo;s expression didn&rsquo;t change, but somehow his smile went from being
warm and interested to being merely polite. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m actually one of your
passengers,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I heard that you arrived last night. If
you weren&rsquo;t too tired, I&rsquo;d be happy to show you around the castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, that would be fun,&rdquo; Miguella said quickly. Tahura closed
her mouth with a click, then smiled back at Arne&rsquo;s knowing grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fun?&rdquo; The two girls jumped. Fat Andre was standing behind them with a
scowl on his face. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not here t&rsquo; have fun. You&rsquo;re here t&rsquo;
earn some money!&rdquo; His scowl deepened as he saw who the two cloudherds
had been talking to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Larsson, i&rsquo;n&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The Garheimmen bobbed his head again. &ldquo;At your service,&rdquo; he said
politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmph,&rdquo; the trader snorted. &ldquo;Only service I want t&rsquo;is time o&rsquo; t&rsquo;
mornin&rsquo; is t&rsquo; service of a warm bed. You!&rdquo; He pointed at Miguella.
&ldquo;You an&rsquo; your brot&rsquo;er, I want you t&rsquo; check t&rsquo; supplies. T&rsquo;ere&rsquo;s a
man waitin&rsquo; by your rooms t&rsquo; show you t&rsquo; way.&rdquo; His finger swung
sideways to point at Tahura. &ldquo;An&rsquo; you go talk wit&rsquo; t&rsquo; passengers,
make sure t&rsquo;ey&rsquo;ve all got enough warm t&rsquo;ings. I don&rsquo; want anyone
turnin&rsquo; into icicles on t&rsquo;is trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be happy to take Tahura around to the delegates&rsquo; quarters,&rdquo;
Arne said smoothly. &ldquo;Angvesund Castle can be very confusing for
newcomers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Tahura was afraid Fat Andre would ask the Garheimmen how
much his service would cost, but all he said was, &ldquo;T&rsquo;ank you, t&rsquo;at&rsquo;d
be an &lsquo;elp. Eit&rsquo;er of you &lsquo;ave any questions? No? Good, t&rsquo;en I want
you back upstairs for lunch. We &lsquo;ave some maps t&rsquo; look at.&rdquo; He nodded
curtly at Arne, then strode off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe you could show me around after lunch,&rdquo; Miguella said
wistfully.</p>
<p>Arne bobbed his head one more time. &ldquo;At your service,&rdquo; he said
politely. Miguella hesitated a moment, as if to say something more, then
smiled weakly and headed off for the store rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that was mean,&rdquo; Tahura said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Arne asked innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash; you&mdash; Oh, never mind.&rdquo; She suddenly noticed Prince Evan on
the other side of the courtyard. He was standing next to an elderly
woman wearing the same gray jacket and ankle-length red skirt that he
was. The woman seemed to be talking to him, but the prince was looking
over her shoulder at Tahura. On a whim she took Arne&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did Fat Andre know your name, anyway?&rdquo; she asked as she and Arne
walked slowly toward the nearby door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a long story&hellip;&rdquo; Arne began. Tahura didn&rsquo;t really hear the
next few words he said. She was concentrating too hard on not looking
over her shoulder to see if Prince Evan was watching as the door closed
behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Your Grace?&rdquo; Prince Evan said, pulling his eyes away from
the door as it closed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I was&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were looking at the girls, instead of attending me,&rdquo; Balance
Petcharatiriv said waspishly. &ldquo;<em>Again</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince had met women who became round-edged and cheerful as they
grew older. Balance Petcharatiriv wasn&rsquo;t one of those. She seemed to
have dried out, like the desert plants of her native Arp. Her skin lay
in wrinkles, and her scalp showed through her wispy white hair in
places, but her dark eyes were as sharp as a falcon&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Just now those sharp eyes were glaring at Prince Evan. He tugged at his
gray jacket uncomfortably and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Your Grace.&rdquo; His mind
was still on Tahura and the blond Garheimmen. He wondered how they had
met, and whether she had made a point of leaving with him just to be
annoying. The possibility that she might actually like her companion
didn&rsquo;t even occur to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tcha.&rdquo; The Balance clicked her tongue in disgust. &ldquo;I <em>said</em>, Nils
Bingtsson has requested my presence at a state breakfast this morning.
I&rsquo;m not sure what the point is&mdash;probably just more jammering&mdash;but it
would be foolish not to go. You&rsquo;ll wait on me there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely the Garheimmen will provide you with a server, Your Grace,&rdquo;
the prince protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely they will,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;But the invitation was to me alone,
and I want you there in the dining hall. My eyes aren&rsquo;t as quick as
they used to be, and my ears feel like they&rsquo;re stuffed with moss in
this cold. Now, let&rsquo;s be off&mdash;this place has more stairs than my old
legs like.&rdquo; She put one bony hand on the prince&rsquo;s shoulder and stabbed
the ground with the cane she held in the other.</p>
<p>The prince was careful to walk at Balance Petcharatiriv&rsquo;s hobbling
pace, even though he sometimes suspected that she could outrun him if
she chose to. He had been her apprentice for a little over a year, and
had discovered that she was never exactly what she seemed to be. He was
still trying to work up the courage to ask her to cut her fingernails.
In Ensworth, two months ago, when he worn a light gray shirt instead of
his uniform jacket, her grip had often left marks on his shoulder.</p>

<p>Three hours later, with the sun high above them, Prince Evan and Balance
Petcharatiriv sat on her balcony looking out over the city. Its harbor
alone was as large as Ensworth town. Dozens of small, rocky islands had
been connected with bridges, the channels between them straightened and
walled to make canals, until stone and dark water were braided together
like ribbons. The homes and shops and warehouses were made of brick and
limestone, red-brown or white gray. Prince Evan had seen tiny shells and
the outlines of long-dead fish in some of the limestone blocks in the
palace, and had been told that sometimes the quarrymen found giant
bones, or teeth the size of a grown man&rsquo;s hand. Despite the sunshine,
he was glad for his jacket, and for the fleece-lined boots that he wore
underneath his skirt.</p>
<p>Finally Balance Petcharatiriv sighed and set her mug down. &ldquo;They make
good tea here,&rdquo; she observed. &ldquo;I suppose it comes from drinking so
little else.&rdquo; Suddenly she raised her arm to point. &ldquo;There, do you see
that? That spire? The last time I was here, oh, twenty years ago,
perhaps, they were just laying the foundations for it. The tallest
belltower in the kingdom, it was. But now look at it.&rdquo; She flicked her
hand sideways to take in the three taller towers that stood beside the
one she had pointed to. &ldquo;It looks positively stunted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do seem to love the sound of bells, Your Grace&rdquo; the prince said
politely, setting his own empty mug down on the wide arm of his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, where does the War of Ghosts get its name?&rdquo; the Balance
asked after a moment.</p>
<p>The prince had grown used to her sudden changes of topic. He had learned
that she always managed to tie the strands together somehow. &ldquo;Um, the
name was first used by the Yrvian minstrel Gerard&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gerard the <em>Younger</em>,&rdquo; the Balance corrected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Gerard the Younger, in his ballad about the never-ending war
between Former and Latter Leyselle. No-one can remember any longer how
the fighting started. It keeps going because each battle leaves both
sides with fresh grievances against the other. Gerard compared it to the
way that a ghost lingers as long as someone remembers its story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; the Balance grunted. She reached for her tea, remembered
that the mug was empty, and tapped her fingers on the arm of her chair
instead. &ldquo;So, why do you think the Garheimmen love the sound of bells?
Or more specifically, why do you think they keep taxing those lovely
ships down there in the harbor to build new belltowers, when this city
already looks like a stone forest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince thought furiously. &ldquo;Because&hellip; In case the vampires come
back? To call them to battle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Balance Petcharatiriv sighed. &ldquo;No. A romantic idea, but wrong.&rdquo; She
sucked at her teeth for a moment. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try the water at another
well, shall we? Why do you think that otherwise sensible people would
get out of bed every morning in the dark to go and watch the sun rise?
And don&rsquo;t say, &lsquo;to make sure there are no vampires among them&rsquo;,&rdquo; she
warned, as the prince opened his mouth. &ldquo;You know perfectly well that
their magicians would be able to tell if there were any undead within
miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince smiled politely. &ldquo;Yes, Your Grace, I know. Greeting the sun
each morning reminds them of their struggle to free themselves from
vampire rule. And&mdash;and building the belltowers reminds them as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tcha. Half right. It does more than remind them. It <em>defines</em> them.
Before the sky fell, every little village up here had its own chief.
Garheim, Sinheim, the little princedoms in between&mdash;they were just
names. But then the Pale Remainder arrived, and turned them all into
blood cattle. Their rebellion is what turned them into a nation, and
some of them are afraid that the memory of those years is the only thing
that keeps them from splintering apart again.&rdquo; She waved her hand at
the city in front of them. &ldquo;Hence, the belltowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By &lsquo;some of them&rsquo;, Your Grace, I take it you mean the Clear Light?&rdquo;
he ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, so you <em>do</em> listen to me somtimes,&rdquo; she said approvingly. &ldquo;We
might teach you to think yet.&rdquo; She shifted in her chair, then smoothed
the quilt that lay across her legs. &ldquo;Now, breakfast. Tell me everything
you saw and heard. <em>Everything.</em>&ldquo;</p>
<p>Prince Evan suppressed a sigh, then closed his eyes for a second to
order his thoughts. &ldquo;Eleven of the Empty Throne were there,&rdquo; he began.
&ldquo;They were seated when we arrived, except for Nils Bingtsson. I saw
three rise when we entered&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foolish custom,&rdquo; Balance Petcharatiriv snorted. &ldquo;Jumping up and down
like kangaroos. Anyway, go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sat next to Nils&hellip;&rdquo; the prince continued.</p>
<p>The so-called Lesser Dining Hall was as large as the throne room in
Ensworth Castle. The delicately-carved table that took up most of the
room had been carved from the red-brown body of a single sequoia, which
had been driven out of the Herd of Trees and into Garheim a century ago.
As in the Greater Dining Hall, the Summer Dining Hall, and for all
Prince Evan knew the slop room in the dungeon, a golden crown was
painted on the back of the chair that stood at the table&rsquo;s head. No-one
had sat in any of those chairs since the Pale Remainder defeated the
last breathing king of Garheim.</p>
<p>Balance Petcharatiriv grunted slightly, dropping onto her chair as much
as sitting on it. Prince Evan nodded politely to the Garheimman who had
shown them to her seat. &ldquo;I enjoyed this morning&rsquo;s ceremony very much,
Your Honor,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was quite moving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Nils Bingtsson replied. Instead of the silver-and-blue
robe he had worn that morning as he led the castle&rsquo;s staff and visitors
in greeting the sun, he was wearing a richly-embroidered jacket, dark
trousers, and polished knee-high boots. His long hair was still the
color of honey, and the heavy sun-shaped medallion that hung on a golden
chain around his neck was the only visible sign that he was one of the
most powerful men in Garheim.</p>
<p>Balance Petcharatiriv dug her elbow into the soft spot between Prince
Evan&rsquo;s ribs and hip. &ldquo;Tea,&rdquo; she ordered. &ldquo;And bread, with some of
that cheese we had yesterday. One of the many sins I&rsquo;ve acquired a
taste for since I left Arp,&rdquo; she confided in Nils as he took his seat
beside her. &ldquo;Strong cheese, mountain views, and soft beds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nils smiled politely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pleased that we can offer you all three,
Your Grace. I hope you won&rsquo;t mind if two of them are temporarily
unavailable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Balance Petcharatiriv sighed theatrically. Prince Evan hid a wince as
she patted the head of the Empty Throne on the arm, for all the world
just a grandmotherly old woman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll manage,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;That is, if we&rsquo;re still going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Garheimman&rsquo;s eyes stopped smiling, although his mouth didn&rsquo;t move.
&ldquo;Our clouds arrived last night,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The trader, Andre, assures
me that&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was actually more worried about yesterday&rsquo;s vote,&rdquo; Balance
Petcharatiriv interrupted smoothly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m told that if I was not
already here, some of your colleagues might have had second thoughts. Or
rather,&rdquo; she corrected herself, raising a finger as Nils opened his
mouth, &ldquo;Or rather, might have <em>expressed</em> the second thoughts they&rsquo;ve
already had?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he could answer, the Garheimman was interrupted again. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know that it would be right to call them &lsquo;second&rsquo; thoughts,&rdquo; said the
woman to the Balance&rsquo;s right. &ldquo;Many of those who voted for this&hellip;
<em>mission</em>&hellip; did so despite strong reservations. Are you truly surprised
that they would give voice to their doubts as we draw closer to the
point of no return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gudrun Astridsdottir&rsquo;s tone was light, as if they were discussing the
weather or a minstrel&rsquo;s voice. Like Nils, she wore a golden chain with
a sun-shaped medallion. Her taste in clothing was much simpler,
however&mdash;plain brown homespun, and heavy boots like the ones the
cloudherds wore&mdash;and her gray-blond hair was knotted into a long braid,
which was then knotted again to make a bun.</p>
<p>Nils Prince Evan silently set a pot of tea, some dark, sour bread, and a
plate of cheese in front of the Balance as Nils and Gudrun glared
politely at one another. The prince guessed that Nils would speak
first&mdash;he was the sort of man who always seemed to do so&mdash;but instead
it was Balance Petcharatiriv who broke the silence. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said
brightly, lifting the lid on the teapot to sniff at its contents. &ldquo;No
point letting it go cold, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As with any opportunity, Your Grace,&rdquo; Nils replied. &ldquo;It must be
eaten while it is hot, or it loses its flavor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thus did the little girl burn her tongue,&rdquo; Gudrun countered,
spooning some gooseberry preserve onto the bread in front of her. She
offered it to Balance Petcharatiriv, who shook her head.</p>
<p>Nils smiled. &ldquo;Better to burn your tongue than to starve because you&rsquo;re
afraid of eating.&rdquo; He tapped the table lightly, impatiently, with the
handle of his fork. &ldquo;Forty years is long enough, and more than long
enough. There is nothing for us in the north that we cannot get by
honest trade, except broken ships and graves for our soldiers. If the
Anuat are willing to sue for peace&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the Anuat are willing to sue for peace, it is only because they
think they can gain more from us that way than by fighting!&rdquo; Gudrun
said loudly. The babble of conversation at the table halted. &ldquo;And if
that is the case, then <em>now</em> is exactly when we should strike them
hardest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that monster they call king,&rdquo; someone added. There were murmurs
of &lsquo;hear, hear&rsquo; around the table.</p>
<p>Bingtsson sighed as threatrically as Balance Petcharatiriv had a few
minutes earlier. When he spoke, it was to the room at large as much as
to his sparring partner. &ldquo;Gudrun, the Empty Throne has debated this for
months. We know how you feel. And we know how your <em>friends</em> feel, even
if they&rsquo;re not willing to speak their minds directly.&rdquo; A few people
frowned at that, but Nils pressed on. &ldquo;Our people eat well. They trade
the length and breadth of Cherne, and raise their children in the
daylight. What do we have to gain from another forty years of
bloodshed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask rather, what do we have to lose from ending this now,&rdquo; a
heavy-set man on the other side of the table said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lose?&rdquo; Balance Petcharatiriv asked them all grumpily, her voice
cutting through the buzz. &ldquo;What is there to lose? Unless my memory has
finally failed me, you lot have reserved yourselves the right to vote
yea or nay on whatever agreement we reach. How can you possibly lose
until you know what the stakes are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we are very grateful to you, Your Grace, for agreeing to work
under such unusual conditions,&rdquo; Nils said warmly. &ldquo;We realize
that&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unusual?&rdquo; the old woman snapped. &ldquo;Unprecedented, is more like it.
Why, my old master&rsquo;s ashes would go soggy if he knew that I&rsquo;d agreed
to this. Boy! Boy! Where are&mdash;there you are. I&rsquo;m out of cheese!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prince Evan opened his eyes and blinked. The sun had climbed as high as
it was going to. The seagulls were gossipping with each other in the
distance near the docks. Balance Petcharatiriv seemed lost in her
thoughts. When she sighed, it was just a plain old everyday sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hardest thing is getting everyone to understand their own best
interests,&rdquo; she said quietly, as if speaking to herself. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
strike a balance between people who are off balance themselves.&rdquo; She
fell silent again.</p>
<p>Prince Evan watched her brood for a moment, then asked, &ldquo;Do you mean
Gudrun Astridsdottir, Your Grace? She seems very angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Balance Petcharatiriv shook her head. &ldquo;No, that one knows what her
interests are. No truce with kings, no dealings with the undead, and
above all, the Garheimmen must never be seen to be defeated.&rdquo; She
sighed again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Nils that I&rsquo;m worried about. Half of him wants to
be king, in deed if not in name, but the rest of him still believes in
this silly voting idea they all seem so wedded to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glanced at her apprentice, taking in his tired eyes and the way he
was sitting up extra-straight in his chair. &ldquo;Leave me here for a
while,&rdquo; she said, as gently as she ever said anything. &ldquo;I have some
thinking to do, and I&rsquo;ll do it best with my eyes closed. Take a look at
the docks, if you want, or one of the castle libraries.&rdquo; She settled
back in her chair and let her chin settle onto her chest. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m told
the one in Brodvesund Castle has more than six hundred books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Your Grace, but I still have some packing to do.&rdquo; Prince
Evan stood up. &ldquo;Shall I come for you later?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Balance Petcharatiriv opened her eyes and studied him from under the two
wisps that served her as eyebrows. Not for the first time, the prince
wondered if she could read minds. &ldquo;The other hardest thing is finding
your own balance,&rdquo; she finally said. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t let the ups and downs
of your own life get in the way of what you have sworn to do. Whether
they are of one mind or not, these people need us. They <em>trust</em> us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She closed her eyes again. &ldquo;Give me two hours, no more. And bring some
tea with you when you come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Your Grace,&rdquo; the prince said. He bowed, turned, and left.</p>

<p>Prince Evan waited almost three hours before waking Balance
Petcharatiriv. He unpacked the clothes, law books, and gifts they were
taking north, then re-packed them exactly as they had been before. At
first he tried not to think about Tahura, but eventually he gave up and
let his mind wander. She must have met the Garheimman in the courtyard,
he decided&mdash;unless she had run into him in some other town, on some
other journey. Fat Andre&rsquo;s couriers travelled all over Cherne, and
Garheim&rsquo;s trading fleet sailed the length of the east coast, from Barra
Bantang in the south to Anuvatik in the north, and around to the Gulf of
Yr. They could have met anywhere, he concluded glumly. Tahura hadn&rsquo;t
answered his letters for a year. Anything could have happened in a year.</p>
<p>The prince expected Balance Petcharatiriv to complain about his
tardiness when he woke her, but all she said was, &ldquo;I hope that tea is
stronger than the last pot.&rdquo; She asked him questions about his studies
as she drank it, correcting a point here and elaborating a point there
as he described the treaties and judgments that famous Balances had
handed down in the past. When the pot was empty, he helped her stand,
then followed her into the castle.</p>
<p>A few moments later, someone knocked on the Balance&rsquo;s door. &ldquo;Welcome
in,&rdquo; Balance Petcharatiriv said loudly. The door opened silently, and a
steward the prince had not seen before stepped in. &ldquo;Your Grace,&rdquo; he
said, bowing his head. &ldquo;Nils Bingtsson sends his best wishes for your
continued good health, and asks whether you are ready to depart tomorrow
after the sun has been greeted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My thanks as always for His Honor&rsquo;s kind thoughts,&rdquo; the Balance
replied. She glanced at Prince Evan. At his nod, she added, &ldquo;We are
prepared at your convenience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The steward bowed his head again, stepped out, and closed the door.
&ldquo;And about time,&rdquo; Balance Petcharatiriv muttered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting a bit
tired of having all these pretty pigeons fluttering around. See if you
can get one of them to bring us some dinner,&rdquo; she ordered the prince.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel up to another round of jousting tonight. It&rsquo;ll be a
long day tomorrow, and we could both use some rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prince Evan was already awake the next morning when the gentle tapping
came on his door. He lay beneath his quilt for a few moments, studying
the sky outside his window. A few stars were still visible, but even as
he watched, one of them disappeared into the brightening gray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he finally called. The tapping stopped, and the servant who had
attended him every morning since his arrival stepped in with his usual
silver basin, pot of soap, and razor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Your Highness,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It appears to be a good day
for travelling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; the prince replied as he threw aside the quilt and
reached for his clothes. &ldquo;Is it cold out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unusually so, for this time of year.&rdquo; The servant set the bowl
down, then placed the soap and razor beside it. With a final bow, and
one more, &ldquo;Your Highness,&rdquo; he left Evan to shave and dress.</p>
<p>The prince stood with Balance Petcharatiriv in the courtyard while Nils
Bingtsson led the castle&rsquo;s inhabitants through the ceremony. The blond
Garheimman, Arne, stood next to Tahura again. Prince Evan kept his eyes
on Nils, and on the soldiers who stood beside him. There was a case in
one of his books, about a trader from Seyferte who had thought to play a
joke on his hosts in a backwater Garheimmen village. He had bought some
smoke paper from a beekeeper, who used it to flush out hives, and tucked
it into his sleeves. When the sun touched him, he had set it alight, and
then screamed as if he was burning up. The king of Seyferte had brought
a suit against the villagers for murder, but the Balance chosen to judge
it had said that such an act was better described as suicide. Prince
Evan looked at the dawn light glinting off the silver heads of the
soldiers&rsquo; arrows, and the silver points on their lances, and wondered
idly how hard it would be to tuck some smoke paper into the back of
Arne&rsquo;s shirt. Then he caught himself, and was ashamed for having
wondered.</p>
<p>Only a few of the people who had gathered in the courtyard went back
into the castle when the ceremony was over. Most moved instead to stand
against the courtyard walls. Prince Evan saw faces in the windows
overlooking the courtyard as well, many of them children&rsquo;s. He
couldn&rsquo;t help but smile. He remembered the first time he had seen a
cloud up close, in the pen below Marandine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; Fat Andre asked his cloudherds. &ldquo;A&rsquo;right, t&rsquo;en, let&rsquo;s get
t&rsquo;is flock on t&rsquo; move!&rdquo; Miguello nodded, closed his eyes, and
mind-spoke to one of the clouds circling above the castle. People
&lsquo;oohed&rsquo; and &lsquo;aahed&rsquo; as the cloud broke away from the little flock
and descended as gently as a snowflake into the courtyard.</p>
<p>Fat Andre waved at it with an arm. &ldquo;Your Honors,&rdquo; he said to Nils,
Gudrun, and the dozen other Garheimmen standing with them. Boxes and
travelling bags already lay on a waterproof tarpaulin on the cloud&rsquo;s
back, all lashed together with rope.</p>
<p>Nils smiled like a child as he clambered up onto the cloud. Two other
Garheimmen joined him, one in a soldier&rsquo;s uniform, the other a
clerkish-looking woman whose name the prince could not remember.
Miguello hopped up nimbly beside them, then waved with Nils at the crowd
as the cloud rose into the air.</p>
<p>The other clouds descended one by one. The prince and Balance
Petcharatiriv found themselves on Miguella&rsquo;s cloud with a shaven-headed
fisherman named Finnbo. Balance Petcharatiriv had insisted that he come
with them, along with someone from the traders&rsquo; and gold miners&rsquo;
guilds, to help with the negotiations. Privately, she had told Prince
Evan that was only half the story: including them in the negotiations
would make it harder for the groups they represented to say no to
whatever treaty was finally struck.</p>
<p>The prince nodded when the Balance spoke to him, but his eyes and
thoughts were on Tahura&rsquo;s cloud. One of her passengers was Gudrun
Astridsdottir, and as the prince had half-expected, the other was Arne
Larsson. As he looked away, he saw Miguella turn her head suddenly, as
if she had been watching him while he had been watching Tahura&rsquo;s cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s, ah, it&rsquo;s quite the thing, in&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Finnbo said nervously as
they rose higher and higher above the city&rsquo;s streets and bell towers.
&ldquo;Never thought I&rsquo;d, ah, well, just never thought.&rdquo; Despite his
nervousness, he was grinning from ear to ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s quite the thing,&rdquo; the prince said absent-mindedly.
Suddenly he remembered where he was, and what his duties were. &ldquo;Would
you like a quilt, Your Grace?&rdquo; he asked the Balance. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be much
colder higher up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Balance was wearing two pairs of woollen tights under her skirt, and
a bulky sweater beneath her jacket. Even so, she nodded. &ldquo;I think the
green one is warmest,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And that hat I bought, the one with
the seal fur.&rdquo; She turned to Miguella. &ldquo;Are you <em>sure</em> we can&rsquo;t light
a fire?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite sure, Your Grace,&rdquo; the cloudherd replied cheerfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid the next pot of tea won&rsquo;t be until Bollesund. Oh, but look! Out
there, beyond the harbor. Whales!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prince Evan looked down at the city, at the ships at anchor in the
harbor, and at the gray shadows moving slowly toward the deep ocean.
&ldquo;Look, Tahura,&rdquo; he said under his breath. &ldquo;They <em>are</em> real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo; Finnbo asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; the prince said, shaking his head. &ldquo;Just an old joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few hundred yards behind them, and fifty yards below, Tahura followed
Arne&rsquo;s pointing finger. &ldquo;Yes, I see them,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t used
to believe they were real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think a lot of people would have said the same thing about clouds
before yesterday,&rdquo; Arne replied. &ldquo;Did you hear Fat Andre talking
to&mdash;what?&rdquo; Tahura had started to giggle. &ldquo;What did I say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t let him hear you call him that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what everybody called him when I was little, but now that he&rsquo;s rich, he
doesn&rsquo;t like it at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well then, did you hear Normal-Sized Andre and the fishermen&rsquo;s
speaker last night? They were talking about bringing a couple of clouds
back here in the spring, to help the boats find the salmon runs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might be fun,&rdquo; Tahura said. &ldquo;But I bet it would be really cold.
It&rsquo;s all still arctic air up here at that time of year.&rdquo; She shivered.</p>
<p>Arne put his arm around her shoulders. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not cold now, are
you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>She shivered again, then relaxed as he squeezed her, just slightly.
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Not any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They travelled all day, following the rocky coastline north toward
Anuvatik. The summer-rich fields near Garheim-in-Garheim gave way to
scattered towns, then to fishing villages whose houses clustered
together against the cold. Fields and orchards became forests of
hemlock, punctuated here and there by the gray stone bark of a limestone
pine. The roads became cart tracks, then disappeared entirely, leaving
only the sky, the sea, the dark pine forest, and the small flock of
clouds.</p>
<p>The sun was half-hidden by the western horizon by the time they reached
Bollesund. It was larger than most of the other villages they had seen,
home to perhaps a hundred families. Its bell tower was made of stone, as
was the breakwater that half-closed its small harbor. The
brightly-painted doors on the houses reminded Prince Evan of Tahura&rsquo;s
home, Marandine.</p>
<p>A single bell began to ring <em>clong, clong, clong</em> as the clouds
descended toward the village. People ran out into the street, waving and
pointing. The prince smiled as one small boy ran back into his house in
terror, his mother chasing after him.</p>
<p>They touched down in a cow pasture on the south side of the village.
Prince Evan leaped down, then turned to help Balance Petcharatiriv
slither off the cloud. &ldquo;Not the most graceful entrance I&rsquo;ve ever
made,&rdquo; she muttered, brushing at her skirt. &ldquo;I <em>hope</em> they&rsquo;ve made
tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they will have, Your Grace,&rdquo; the prince said soothingly.</p>
<p>The fisherman, Finnbo, dropped lightly to the ground beside them.
&ldquo;Har!&rdquo; he roared, throwing his arms wide. Three children galloped
across the pasture and threw themselves at him. He picked all three up
together and spun them around, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Grace?&rdquo; Prince Evan touched the Balance&rsquo;s arm and pointed. &ldquo;I
think we&rsquo;re over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They trudged across the pasture to the fence gate. The whole village
seemed to have gathered there to welcome the travellers. A middle-aged
woman in plain brown homespun and sturdy knee-high boots bowed her head
to them and said, &ldquo;We give thanks to the clear light, that it has shown
you a safe path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nils Bingtsson bowed his head in return. &ldquo;May the sun shine clearly on
all that you do,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>The woman suddenly smiled a broad, gap-toothed smile. &ldquo;We almost
weren&rsquo;t ready for you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When the gull came with your
message, Lars here thought it was someone&rsquo;s idea of a prank.&rdquo; She dug
a friendly elbow into the ribs of the grinning man beside her. &ldquo;We
would&rsquo;ve all been out snaggling for pennyheads if we&rsquo;d believed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bingtsson&rsquo;s smile was as wide as the village reeve&rsquo;s, and seemed as
sincere. &ldquo;Then let us be thankful that Lars is not more persuasive,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s persuasive, believe me,&rdquo; a woman said loudly from the back
of the crowd. Everyone laughed as the man in question turned around and
waved, as if he were a champion horse rider who had just won a race.</p>
<p>Two hours later, Balance Petcharatiriv sighed and set her tea down on
the table in front of her. &ldquo;Been waiting all day for that,&rdquo; she said
contentedly. &ldquo;Still think there has to be some way to light a fire on a
cloud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d be happy to lend you one of the pot stoves we use on the boats,
Your Grace,&rdquo; the reeve said. She and half a dozen other villagers were
sitting at the table with the Balance and the Garheimmen who would be
negotiating with the Anuat. From his place beside Balance Petcharatiriv,
Prince Evan could hear the soldiers, the cloudherds, and most of the
rest of the village out in the square. They sounded like they were
having more fun, but having been raised a prince, Evan was so used to
that that he hardly noticed it any longer.</p>
<p>He only caught a glimpse of Tahura and the others as he and Balance
Petcharatiriv were led to the house they were to sleep in. The reeve
smothered Nils&rsquo;s sincere-sounding protests by explaining that the
family who lived there were going to sleep on their boat that night.
&ldquo;They do it whenever the fish are running,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;And in rougher
waters than the harbor.&rdquo; Prince Evan had to lie on his side with his
knees pulled up to fit into the child&rsquo;s bed in the corner. As always,
Balance Petcharatiriv began to snore a heartbeat after she closed her
eyes.</p>
<p>Prince Evan woke the next morning with a kink in his neck. He rubbed the
grit from his eyes, then sat up and rocked his head from side to side
until he heard something go <em>click</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mmph,&rdquo; Balance Petcharatiriv grunted, rolling over beneath three
quilts. &ldquo;Is that the bell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so, Your Grace,&rdquo; the prince yawned. He dressed quickly,
then laid out the Balance&rsquo;s clothes and stepped outside. One of the
children who had flung himself at Finnbo the night before was waiting
for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m to take you down to the water,&rdquo; he said, eyeing the prince as if
he were some strange fish that had learned to walk. &ldquo;Do you have a
sword?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sword?&rdquo; the prince blinked. &ldquo;Um, no, I didn&rsquo;t bring one. Should
I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean for this morning,&rdquo; the boy said. &ldquo;Some of the men last
night had swords. One of them even juggled his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can juggle balls,&rdquo; the prince offered, feeling slightly foolish.
&ldquo;Or rolled-up socks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; The boy shrugged. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led the prince and Balance Petcharatiriv down the village&rsquo;s one
street to the harbor. Most of the villagers were already there. As the
stragglers joined them in two&rsquo;s and three&rsquo;s, the travellers were
ushered to the front line. The reeve stood in front of them in the same
homespun she had worn the night before. Now, however, she also wore a
length of yellow cord around her neck, from which a small gold disk
hung. Three men stood behind her with silver-edged axes in their hands.</p>
<p>When the last of the villagers had taken their place, the reeve raised
her arms. &ldquo;Today is special,&rdquo; she said without preamble. &ldquo;Today, we
have guests among us. They have a long journey before them, with a rocky
shore at its end. They go with our best hopes, and we wish them well.&rdquo;
She lowered her arms and looked at Nils. &ldquo;Your Honor?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;Will you say the words?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, reeve,&rdquo; Nils replied, bowing his head slightly, &ldquo;But
here, in this place, I think there is someone else who could say them
better. Someone who sees the clear light better than most.&rdquo; He raised
his voice slightly. &ldquo;Gudrun Astridsdottir, will you say the words?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince saw the startled look that flashed across Gudrun&rsquo;s face, and
wondered if this was some subtle kind of trap. He had grown up in the
king&rsquo;s court in Ensworth, and had learned to wonder &lsquo;why?&rsquo; whenever
someone offered him a gift.</p>
<p>But Gudrun merely nodded and stepped forward, saying, &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; to
Nils and the reeve together. The reeve took her place in line as Gudrun
turned to face the crowd. When she spoke, her voice was clear and
strong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My grandfather used to tell a story,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;A story about a
ship that sailed into Bollesund harbor one day. Its only cargo was a
monster that drank human blood. It and its kind rode us, whipped us, and
ground us down like corn meal for hundreds of years. But on that day,
everything changed. The crew of that ship decided that they would rather
die in the light than live in the darkness. They set fire to their own
decks, and hammered holes in their own hull, and took their ship and the
monster it carried to the bottom of the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears had started running down her cheeks. She did not seem to notice.
&ldquo;They paid with their lives,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They paid with their lives,
and the people of this village had to flee into the wilderness, but the
seed they planted grew like an alder. It spread its roots throughout our
land, and from each of those roots a new tree grew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice grew stronger. &ldquo;We stand here now, in the clear light of day,
because of what they did. Because of what they did, we can put our
children to bed without fearing that we wil find nothing but drained
husks in the morning. Because of what they did, we need not fear the
night, because we know that the sun will drive it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sun had cleared the mountain wall behind the village. The only sound
was that of the waves. Gudrun looked left and right at the people
assembled before her, then raised her arms. &ldquo;I say all gathered here to
greet the sun are truly made,&rdquo; she said clearly. &ldquo;Does any here say
otherwise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No-one spoke. &ldquo;Then give thanks for the clear light,&rdquo; Gudrun
commanded. The tear tracks on her face glistened in the dawn. &ldquo;May it
keep you safe from darkness, and those who dwell in darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May it keep you safe also,&rdquo; the crowd murmured in response. The
prince started to let go of Balance Petcharatiriv&rsquo;s hand, but she held
on for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;Look around you, and remember.&rdquo; The
prince saw tears on more than a few faces, tears and smiles together.
There was suddenly a lump in his own throat as well. He blinked and took
a slow, deep breath to clear it, then turned and followed the others
toward breakfast. He did not remember afterward what was said. The
villagers waved as the clouds rose into the air and headed north, then
turned toward their boats. There were nets to mend, and pennyheads to
snaggle.</p>

<p><em>He lay in a dreamless sleep beneath the deck of his small boat as the
clouds passed overhead. Even if the travellers had thought to look down
at this one particular rocky islet, the spells he had cast would have
hidden the boat from their sight. All they would have seen was a small
patch of water that the waves somehow avoided.</em></p>
<p><em>His sleep had not always been dreamless. It had taken him many years to
train his mind not to think, not to remember, and above all not to
crave, when it was let off its leash. He had tried to teach the others,
once, but they had not wanted to learn.</em></p>
<p><em>A handful of seals hesitated at the mouth of the cove where the boat
was moored. The female in the lead sniffed at the air as she bobbed up
and down. Something was not right. She flicked her tail and swam away.
The others followed. The ocean was large. There were other beaches to
bask on.</em></p>

<p>It took them three more days to reach Anuvatik. They touched down to
cook a hot dinner the first night at the head of an L-shaped fjord, but
spent the second night in the air. The cloudherds took turns napping,
four hours at a time. Prince Evan stayed awake while Miguella slept. The
others shepherded her cloud by riding above, behind, and on either side
of it, so that it wouldn&rsquo;t turn back for land, or climb so high that
its passengers would not be able to breathe.</p>
<p>During the day, the prince watched for icebergs. He had read about them
in the books in Balance Petcharatiriv&rsquo;s library, and had marvelled at
the hand-tinted pictures of strange, angular shapes that dwarfed the
ships shown beside them for scale. He wasn&rsquo;t disappointed that they
didn&rsquo;t see any&mdash;the book had said that they usually formed in the
spring, then drifted south and melted during the summer. He was a bit
more worried by the fact that he didn&rsquo;t see any land, either, but
neither Miguella nor Balance Petcharatiriv seemed to mind.</p>
<p>Miguella gave up trying to make conversation with the prince when it
became clear that his responses were going to remain short, though
polite. She started asking Balance Petcharatiriv questions about places
she had been, and things she had seen, and despite himself the prince
found that he was listening in. The Balance had lived a long, and full,
life. She talked about the great grassy plains of Arp, with their huge
herds of cattle and mile-wide locust storms, and about the years she had
spent in the Clockwork Mountains trying to persuade the dwarves to talk
to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I finally gave up when one of them walked right through my camp fire
without bothering to say hello,&rdquo; she said, smiling fondly. &ldquo;There I
was, trying my hardest to be interesting, and they were just too wrapped
up in themselves to pay me the attention I deserved.&rdquo; The prince caught
Miguella&rsquo;s look, and glanced away.</p>
<p>Before anyone could say anything else they heard a yell from the cloud
beside them. &ldquo;Terns!&rdquo; Miguello shouted, pointing up and ahead. The
prince stood and shaded his eyes.</p>
<p>Miguella saw them first. &ldquo;I have them,&rdquo; she called back. &ldquo;Do you
see?&rdquo; she asked the Balance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but there&rsquo;s a lot I don&rsquo;t at my age,&rdquo; Balance Petcharatiriv
replied. &ldquo;Give me your hand,&rdquo; she ordered Prince Evan. He helped her
struggle to her feet. &ldquo;They need armrests on these silly things,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Armrests and teapots. Now, where are these silly birds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up there, Your Grace,&rdquo; the prince told her. &ldquo;Two of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three,&rdquo; Miguella corrected. &ldquo;The third one is hanging back&mdash;there,
do you see it?&rdquo; She put one hand on the prince&rsquo;s shoulder and pointed
with the other.</p>
<p>The prince squinted for a moment, then nodded. &ldquo;Yes. Yes, I see them.
Thank you.&rdquo; Miguella hesitated, then took her hand from his shoulder
and nodded back.</p>
<p>The three birds closed the gap between themselves and the herd of clouds
in an eyeblink. One instant they were just three bent lines scratched on
the clear blue sky, and the next they had overshot the travellers,
flipped themselves around like leaves in a strong breeze, and were
flying parallel to the clouds. The prince noticed that the one who had
been hanging back stayed out of bowshot, while the other two gradually
edged closer and closer to the travellers.</p>
<p>Miguello nudged his cloud sideways until it was only a few feet away
from his sister&rsquo;s. As he did so, Nils ran his fingers through his hair,
then straightened his blue and silver cloak. Its tail flapped behind him
like a flag.</p>
<p>Suddenly one of the terns tilted, slipped sideways, and landed on
Miguello&rsquo;s cloud. It settled its wings on its back and ran its beak
through the feathers on its breast, then hopped toward the Garheimman
and squawked, &ldquo;Greetings! May the waves be gentle beneath you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nils bowed his head slightly. &ldquo;And our greetings to you and yours,&rdquo; he
replied gravely. &ldquo;May the sun shine clearly on all that you do.&rdquo; He
waved an arm to take in the whole of the small herd of clouds. &ldquo;You and
your companions would be welcome to rest here with us for the remainder
of our journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bird had tilted its head so that it could look straight at Nils with
one beady eye. &ldquo;Thank you, but we must return to inform the Great Chief
that you are near. He has been anxious for your safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our journey has been quite safe,&rdquo; the Garheimman replied. &ldquo;Much
quicker, and more comfortable, than it would have been if we had
travelled by sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; the tern squawked. It ruffled its feathers slightly at
the idea of sailing when one could fly.</p>
<p>The second tern fluttered over and landed beside the first. &ldquo;The Great
Chief sends his regards&mdash;&rdquo; it began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already said that,&rdquo; the first tern squawked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the second tern squawked back. &ldquo;You just greeted
them. You were supposed to give them the Great Chief&rsquo;s regards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thank the Great Chief for his concern,&rdquo; Nils interrupted smoothly,
smiling as if he were speaking to a child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he send this letter of safe conduct,&rdquo; the second tern continued.
&ldquo;The one tied to my leg. It tickles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nils gestured to one of the soldiers standing behind him. The man knelt,
pulling a knife from his belt. Both birds were instantly airborne,
squawking, &ldquo;Whoa! Whoa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means no harm!&rdquo; Nils shouted, patting the air with his hands. &ldquo;He
just&mdash;our fingers are clumsy in the cold. He thought to cut away the
string, rather than untying it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Your Honor,&rdquo; the soldier muttered. Nils ignored him. The terns
flapped their wings for another few seconds, then landed on the cloud
again. Prince Evan could see the concentration on the soldier&rsquo;s face as
he cut through the twine that held the small oilskin envelope to the
tern&rsquo;s leg.</p>
<p>Nils unfolded the envelope, glanced at the letter, then refolded it and
handed it to one of the other soldiers. &ldquo;Our thanks to the Great Chief
for his hospitality,&rdquo; he replied, bowing his head slightly. &ldquo;Please
inform him that we should reach Ax Medicine shortly, and look forward to
speaking with him then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Great Chief also wishes to give his regards to Her Grace the
Balance,&rdquo; the tern continued. &ldquo;He is pleased that she has agreed to
find a way for our peoples to end their disagreement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nils nodded, gesturing toward Miguella&rsquo;s cloud. &ldquo;As are we. We hope
that&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>Before he could finish his sentence the terns hopped into the air,
flapped their wings once, and landed in front of Miguella. &ldquo;The Great
Chief sends his greetings to Your Grace,&rdquo; the first one began. &ldquo;May
the waves&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tss!&rdquo; the second one hissed. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; the first one squawked. &ldquo;How can you tell? Mammals all look
the same to me.&rdquo; Prince Evan saw Miguella try to hide the smile on her
face. He started to grin himself, then bit the inside of his cheek and
frowned instead at the look on Balance Petcharatiriv&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please inform the Great Chief that I am honored to be chosen to
mediate this dispute,&rdquo; the old woman said curtly. &ldquo;I look forward to
meeting him, and to sharing a hot cup of tea with him upon our
arrival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tell him,&rdquo; the tern squawked. It burst into the sky with its
partner a wingbeat behind it, then turned and flew away. The third tern
beats its wings a few times to catch up with them.</p>
<p>Nils waited until they were just three distant lines once again before
turning to the Balance. &ldquo;Well, that was more of a greeting than I
expected,&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&mdash;oh bother, can you get us any closer?&rdquo; Balance
Petcharatiriv interrupted her answer to speak to Miguella.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; the cloudherd said. &ldquo;Bumping over!&rdquo; she yelled to her
brother. Her cloud shifted sideways with a noticeable lurch, nearly
spilling the prince and the Balance. There was another lurch a moment
later when her cloud bumped into her brother&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, it&rsquo;s safe,&rdquo; she urged Prince Evan and the Balance. &ldquo;They
hardly ever let anyone slip through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t ask how often &lsquo;hardly ever&rsquo; is,&rdquo; the Balance muttered. She
dug her fingers into the prince&rsquo;s arm as they stepped across the seam
that showed where the two clouds were mushed together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was saying,&rdquo; the Balance continued once they were on Miguello&rsquo;s
cloud, &ldquo;Yes, it was more of a greeting than I expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More paperwork, too,&rdquo; Nils laughed, holding up the letter. &ldquo;It seems
they&rsquo;ve learned more from us than just ironwork and money. A safe
conduct! Why, I doubt there are twenty Anuat all told who could read
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I?&rdquo; the Balance asked, taking it from the Garheimman&rsquo;s hands and
unfolding it. She had to hold it close to her nose to read it. As she
did so, her expression became a frown, then a scowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is something wrong, Your Grace?&rdquo; Prince Evan asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s missing that&rsquo;s wrong,&rdquo; she said, smacking the letter
with the back of her hand in annoyance. She handed it back to Nils.
&ldquo;Look at the signature. &lsquo;Great Chief Agiuppinniq, for all the Anuat
people&rsquo;. Pfah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nils studied the letter for a moment. &ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s a forgery?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, it&rsquo;s not that,&rdquo; she grumbled. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the Wrestler&rsquo;s
name? He&rsquo;s not even mentioned in this.&rdquo; She looked in the direction
the three terns had gone, even though the prince knew there was no way
she could see them any longer.</p>
<p>Nils nodded slowly. &ldquo;I take your point,&rdquo; he said. His smile had been
replaced by a more thoughtful, and to the prince&rsquo;s eyes more honest,
expression. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a chain of whispers, us to the chief, the chief
to Wrestler, and back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then you back to the Empty Throne,&rdquo; the Balance reminded him.
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m too old for this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me if it isn&rsquo;t my place to say so, Your Grace, Your Honor,&rdquo;
Prince Evan said suddenly. &ldquo;But this could actually be a good sign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; Nils asked. The Balance merely looked at him, her old eyes
as sharp the terns&rsquo; had been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s a sign of how much the Anuat want a treaty,&rdquo; he said,
uncomfortable beneath the old woman&rsquo;s gaze. &ldquo;They must know how you
and your people feel about the Wrestler&rsquo;s condition. Perhaps they just
think you will find it less awkward to negotiate with someone who is
still breathing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good point,&rdquo; Nils said. Suddenly his smile came back, and he
clapped the prince on the back. &ldquo;I can see your teaching in him,&rdquo; he
said to the Balance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm,&rdquo; Balance Petcharatiriv said. &ldquo;If only he&rsquo;d show it more
often.&rdquo; But the prince knew her well enough to hear the satisfaction in
her voice, and that warmed him as the three layers of clothes he was
wearing could not.</p>

<p>They saw a reef first, a long dark spur of rock that broke the waves
above it without ever quite reaching up into the air. Then there was an
island, a bare piece of rock painted white with seagull droppings. The
next island was home to a few patches of grass, and the third one after
that wasn&rsquo;t an island at all, but the coastline. They had reached
Anuvatik.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ax Medicine&rsquo;s east of here,&rdquo; Miguella told her passengers. &ldquo;We came
straight across the narrowest way, instead of going there directly. We
should be in town before nightfall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; the prince said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really looking forward to a hot
cup of tea.&rdquo; He kept his face blank as the Balance scowled.</p>
<p>Prince Evan had read about Ax Medicine in the same books that described
icebergs, but the reality was still a disappointment. The Garheimmen
trading post had grown over the years, but even at its largest the
village had been home to fewer than five hundred people. Its docks and
palisade walls seemed overgrown when compared to its single street.
Everything was made of wood that had been brought a board at a time from
the mainland, and had a generally run-down air. It seemed to the prince
that nothing had been painted in many years, and that most of the
repairs he could see had been done a long time ago.</p>
<p>The clouds all touched down together on the broad, gravelled beach
beside the old docks. A band of perhaps twenty Anuat were waiting for
them there beside a small fire. The seams of their gray-brown parkas
were embroidered in red, green, black, and orange, and many had silver
coins stitched around the tops of their boots. All but two of them
carried bows or spears. Unlike the ones in the books the prince had
read, however, their heads were made of bright steel, not flint.</p>
<p>To the prince&rsquo;s surprise, none of the Anuat moved to greet the
travellers as the clouds touched down. Instead, they waited patiently
until the new arrivals had all dismounted. Prince Evan found himself
standing with Nils, Gudrun, and Balance Petcharatiriv, with soldiers on
either side of them and the cloudherds behind them.</p>
<p>With a glance in Gudrun&rsquo;s direction, Nils stepped forward and bowed his
head. Without speaking, he reached under his heavy cloak and pulled out
a small bundle of cloth, tied up with blue and silver ribbons. He
stepped forward to set it on the ground, then straightened and stepped
back.</p>
<p>One of the two Anuat who carried neither bow nor spear stepped forward
and picked up the parcel. He tugged at the ribbons, then unfolded the
soft cloth and turned to show his empty-handed companion the thumb-thick
gold chain it contained. The second Anuat shrugged slightly, as if to
ask, &ldquo;What concern is this of mine?&rdquo; But then he nodded slightly. The
first Anuat refolded the cloth around the chain, slipped it into his
parka, and then cleared his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greetings,&rdquo; he said solemnly. &ldquo;May the waves be gentle beneath you.
The Great Chief welcomes you to his fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nils bowed his head. &ldquo;Our greetings to the Great Chief,&rdquo; he said, in
an equally solemn voice. &ldquo;May the sun shine clearly on all that he
holds dear. We thank the chief for his invitation. We have travelled
far, and will be grateful for the warmth he offers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the formalities out of the way, the Anuat who had stepped forward
smiled and bowed. &ldquo;My name is Mingullaq,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have the honor
of speaking with Nils Bingtsson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The honor is mine,&rdquo; the Garheimman replied smoothly. Prince Evan
tried to pay attention as the two swapped pleasantries and introduction
for the next few minutes, but most of his attention was on the Anuat.
Their faces were brown, but not the same brown as Miguella&rsquo;s or
Tahura&rsquo;s, and seemed very round and flat. Most had delicate patterns
tattooed on their cheeks: tiny circles that barely touched each other,
triple wave shapes, and overlapping diamonds. Their eyes and hair were
black, and while none of them were taller than the prince, he could see
how burly they were even beneath their thick parkas. They reminded him
of the stocky little ponies the traders used as pack animals in the
mountains where Tahura had grown up.</p>
<p>He blinked and began listening to the conversation once again.
&ldquo;&hellip;greet you here himself, but he has not been feeling well,&rdquo;
Mingullaq was saying. &ldquo;He will meet us at the old Customs House. We
have set it aside for you to use during your stay&mdash;we hope it will be
adequate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it will be,&rdquo; Nils said politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Mingullaq smiled. &ldquo;If you would like to bring your
things&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nils hesitated. &ldquo;We do have quite a few trunks and boxes,&rdquo; Gudrun
said, speaking for the first time. &ldquo;We would be grateful if your men
could help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; Mingullaq sighed. &ldquo;Among my people it is the custom for
everyone except the very young and the very old to carry what they
own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another pause. The Anuat kept smiling, but the prince could
see Nils and Gudrun trying to control their anger, and could hear
Balance Petcharatiriv&rsquo;s breath catch. Finally Nils smiled back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, as guest we will respect your ways.&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It may
take us an extra trip, but I am told that the sun has not yet begun to
set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; Mingullaq said. &ldquo;Come, we will show you to the
Customs House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took a few minutes for the soldiers and cloudherds to unload the
travellers&rsquo; boxes and bags. &ldquo;Should I help?&rdquo; Prince Evan asked
Balance Petcharatiriv softly as they watched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied, shaking her head slightly. &ldquo;You are here to
negotiate, not to fetch and carry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I quote you on that the next time you ask for tea?&rdquo; he asked,
trying to make a joke. She shook her head, her mood serious.</p>
<p>They followed Mingullaq and his companion into Ax Medicine. The Anuat
warriors walked in front, behind, and on either side of the travellers
without speaking. Prince Evan felt slightly foolish, as if he were at a
wedding rehearsal or performing in a play that no-one was watching. In
fact, there were a few onlookers, mostly Anuat elders sitting in creaky
rocking chairs on the steps of the houses overlooking the town&rsquo;s one
street. Some of them smoked pipes, while others chewed caribou hides to
soften them, or whittled on pieces of driftwood with sharp steel knives.
No-one waved, or spoke.</p>
<p>The street bent to the left, then straightened again and opened out into
a small square, where a pair of three-story wooden buildings faced each
other. Mingullaq led them to a trio of men standing in front of the
double doors of the one on the right. As they approached, the prince saw
that two of the men were warriors, dressed like those around him. The
third was much older. His face sagged, and his long hair was dull and
matted, instead of shiny and freshly combed like those of the other
Anuat. There were dark stains on the front of his parka.</p>
<p>Mingullaq stopped in front of the older man. &ldquo;Great Chief, may I
present Nils Bingtsson, of the people of Garheim,&rdquo; he said loudly,
gesturing at the Garheimman as he spoke. &ldquo;And Gudrun Astridsdottir,
also of the people of Garheim, and Her Grace the Balance
Petcharatiriv.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man scrunched up his whole face in an exaggerated blink, then
grinned. His top front teeth were missing, and most of his other teeth
had dark brown stains on them. He opened his mouth as if to speak, but
belched instead. A moment later the prince caught a sour whiff of stale
beer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I said,&rdquo; Mingullaq said to Nils, &ldquo;The Great Chief has&hellip;not been
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great chief sniggered. &ldquo;Feel all good,&rdquo; he said in broken
Garheimman. &ldquo;Come! Come! We have big food, big drink together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man who had been with Mingullaq on the beach spoke then. His tone
was soft, but at the sound of his words, the chief half-raised his hands
as if to ward off a blow. He mumbled something apologetic in Anuat, then
straightened up and said, &ldquo;My home is your home,&rdquo; in Garheimmen. He
turned and fumbled with the door, finally kicking it to get it to open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, come,&rdquo; Mingullaq said, waving an arm at the open door. He
walked into the old building with Nils and the other travellers in
single file behind him.</p>
<p>The prince had to suppress a sneeze. The old Customs House had clearly
not been used in a long time. The floorboards had warped so much that
they creaked and groaned underfoot, while the beams overhead were
spotted with old damp. The whole building smelled musty.</p>
<p>The entrance hall led them to the single large room that took up most of
the ground floor. Mingullaq waited until they had assembled, then waved
an arm at the stairs that led up to the open hallway that ran around the
inside of the second story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, make this your home,&rdquo; he said to them. &ldquo;There is firewood in
every room, and clean water in the barrels out back. Some of our people
will stay by the door, in case you need anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again, we thank you for your hospitality,&rdquo; Nils said, bowing, without
even a hint of irony in his voice. &ldquo;May I also ask for a guard for
those of us who are returning to the beach to fetch the rest of our
belongings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A guard?&rdquo; Mingullaq smiled. &ldquo;I do not think you will need guards.
Theft has never been the way of my people, and we value guests above all
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear it,&rdquo; Nils smiled back. &ldquo;May I therefore assume
that we are free to look around Ax Medicine as we choose? Since there is
no danger,&rdquo; he added quickly.</p>
<p>Mingullaq shrugged slightly, recognizing that he was caught. &ldquo;Of
course,&rdquo; he allowed. &ldquo;Although it would be best for you to take one of
my people as a guide if you decide to wander very far. It has been many
years since we lived here in these old wooden tents, and many of them
are no longer safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Nils agreed. He bowed his head slightly. &ldquo;We look
forward to speaking with you again in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the morning,&rdquo; Mingullaq agreed, then left without another word.</p>
<p>Nils waited until he was gone, then turned to the soldiers and
cloudherds. The cloudherds had all set their burdens down on the floor,
but the soldiers still carried theirs. &ldquo;Leave that here, and check the
rooms,&rdquo; Nils said crisply to Arne. &ldquo;Give them all a good sniff. You
three,&rdquo; he waved at one knot of soldiers, &ldquo;Start getting things
upstairs. Everyone else, back to the clouds. I want the rest of our
belongings here as quickly as you can go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was only when Nils barked, &ldquo;And I mean <em>quickly!</em>&rdquo; that Prince Evan
realized how angry the Garheimman was. &ldquo;How dare they?&rdquo; he snarled.
&ldquo;Making us carry our belongings as if we were pack horses, not offering
us a meal&mdash;how <em>dare</em> they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you truly surprised?&rdquo; Gudrun asked. &ldquo;We should just be thankful
that he didn&rsquo;t ask you to wrestle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo; Balance Petcharatiriv barked, her eyes blazing. &ldquo;If
they had come to Garheim-in-Garheim you would have met them with five
hundred soldiers in polished armor, and fed them a fifteen-course meal
with a hundred and one different knives and forks, just to humble them.
Now I do <em>not</em> want this to start badly!&rdquo; She took a deep breath. The
prince wondered if he looked as astonished as Nils and Gudrun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is an insult,&rdquo; the Balance said more quietly, speaking to
them all. &ldquo;A calculated, thought-out insult, that you cannot reply to
without looking petty. But remember, they could have put us in tents,
out there on the tundra, instead of in houses with saunas and privies.
They want this treaty, do not forget that. They just hope that anger
will make you thoughtless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time she was finished, Nils&rsquo; usual outward calm had returned.
&ldquo;My apologies, Your Grace,&rdquo; he said, bowing formally. &ldquo;I should not
have spoken as I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you shouldn&rsquo;t have,&rdquo; the Balance agreed, &ldquo;And I hope you do not
do so again. Now, if someone could bring my chest, <em>I&rsquo;m</em> going to make
some tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prince Evan climbed the stairs beside the Balance, one hand behind her
back but not quite touching her in case she slipped. The upstairs rooms
looked as though they had once been offices, but beds had been moved
into them, and the dried moss in the mattresses was smelled fresh and
clean. Balance Petcharatiriv sat on one bed, then the other, then said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take this one. See if you can get a fire started, I&rsquo;m feeling
chilled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince took a few pieces of kindling from the tidy pile beside the
room&rsquo;s small fireplace, and some tinder from the carved wooden box on
the mantlepiece above it. Both were as dry as old bones, and caught
almost immediately. He put a few dry twigs on the little flame to help
it grow, then added some of the driftwood that lay next to the kindling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get some water for the kettle,&rdquo; he said, once he was sure that
the fire had caught. Balance Petcharatiriv nodded from her perch on the
bed. She was resting her chin on her walking stick, which was propped
upright between her knees. She didn&rsquo;t look up as Prince Evan left the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; the prince said, stepping sideways so as not to bump into
a soldier carrying a crate of documents wrapped in oilskins. Two Anuat
with similar boxes were right behind him. The prince let them go by,
then went down the stairs double-time and bumped into another Anuat with
a small row of tattooed X&rsquo;s on each cheek, who was struggling with the
weight of a large wooden chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; the prince said, and then froze. His eyes went wide.
&ldquo;What-&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many sorry,&rdquo; the Anuat said loudly. His eyes pleaded with the prince.
&ldquo;I clumsy your way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Prince Evan said, thinking quickly. &ldquo;But I
think this belongs to the Balance. Here, I&rsquo;ll help you get it
upstairs.&rdquo; Before the Anuat could protest, the prince took the handle
at one end of the chest and started backing up the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; Balance Petcharatiriv asked indignantly as the prince
and the Anuat bumped and scraped the chest into their room. &ldquo;That
isn&rsquo;t mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince stuck his head out into the corridor, glanced both ways, then
closed the door firmly. &ldquo;I know you,&rdquo; he said to the Anuat, who was
standing with his hands folded in front of him, looking down at the
chest. &ldquo;From Apple Bridge. You&rsquo;re the one who was trying to find the
plague that killed all the dogs, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not some apples like,&rdquo; the Anuat mumbled.</p>
<p>The prince shook his head. &ldquo;Oh, no you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He pointed an accusing
finger at the Anuat&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I recognize your tattoos. You&rsquo;re
Piqaluujaq, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh,&rdquo; the Anuat whispered, holding a finger to his lips. &ldquo;All too
many ears, this place. Am here Qimugjuit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; Balance Petcharatiriv snapped. &ldquo;Exactly <em>what</em> is going
on here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know this man, Your Grace,&rdquo; Prince Evan explained, not taking his
eyes from the Anuat&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I met him in Apple Bridge four years ago. He
pretended to be trading seal pelts, but he was really looking for the
source of the plague that killed off all the dogs. I think he helped
Tahura find my sister, but he disappeared before we could question
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now he&rsquo;s just turned up here?&rdquo; the Balance mused. She got to her
feet and hobbled over to the Anuat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d say that was quite a
coincidence, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glared at the Anuat. &ldquo;Quite a coincidence,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;And a
new name, too. My, my&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Anuat spread his hands sheepishly. &ldquo;Was leave, then, all the time
everyone fight. Too little fight now, but maybe better some other come
home.&rdquo; He bent down to pick up one end of the trunk. &ldquo;Find all the
time you come home,&rdquo; he grunted at the prince as he lifted it. &ldquo;I
show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince hesitated, then picked up his end of the chest. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be
long, Your Grace,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The Balance just shook her head. &ldquo;This is very muddy water,&rdquo; she
muttered. &ldquo;Very muddy water indeed.&rdquo; She sat back down on the bed,
then added, &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t forget some water for the kettle this time!&rdquo;
as Prince Evan struggled out the door.</p>
<p>They half-carried and half-dragged the heavy chest down the landing to
the very last room. The Anuat put his back against the door, nudged the
handle with his elbow, and then pushed back hard to open it.</p>
<p>Unlike the room the prince was sharing with the Balance, this one was
windowless, and still had its original furniture. Three desks with
matching stools jostled each other for space, while the shelves on the
far wall were divided into dozens of small cubbyholes. The Anuat dropped
his end of the chest onto the floor, then sat down heavily on one of the
stools.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too many muscles to an old man,&rdquo; he groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s hard work,&rdquo; the prince agreed. &ldquo;Now, what were you going
to show me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Anuat nodded and rose shakily to his feet, but before he could
speak, the door opened behind the prince. &ldquo;Excuse me, Your Highness,&rdquo;
Mingullaq said, stepping into the room, &ldquo;But what are you&mdash;&rdquo; He
froze, then spat, &ldquo;You! <em>Pauetsitgualuk!</em>&rdquo; He spun around and shouted
in Anuat.</p>
<p>Piqaluujaq leaped over the chest on the floor, shouldered the prince
aside, and slammed his shoulder into Mingullaq, cutting the other Anuat
off mid-shout. Mingullaq stumbled backward through the door. Piqaluujaq
slammed it shut in his face, then whirled around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;&rdquo; the prince began, but Piqaluujaq was already on the other
side of the room. He thrust his arm into one of the cubbyholes.
Something went <em>click</em>, and a whole section of the wall swung inward.
The Anuat hesitated, then put his finger to his lips and said, &ldquo;Sh,&rdquo;
softly to the prince before stepping through the secret door. It
<em>clicked</em> again behind him as it closed.</p>
<p>A moment later the real door burst open. Mingullaq and three Anuat
warriors boiled into the room like angry wasps, spears in their hands.
&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; Mingullaq demanded. &ldquo;Where did he go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the prince stammered. He shook his
head as if he was dizzy. &ldquo;He was&mdash;he was here, but then&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
know, he just vanished.&rdquo; He collapsed onto the nearest stool as though
his legs suddenly couldn&rsquo;t hold his weight.</p>
<p>Mingullaq gave a quick, quiet order to the man to his left. The warrior
nodded and ran out. The prince heard the Anuat&rsquo;s boots thump along the
landing and down the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; Mingullaq asked. &ldquo;That man, he is a bandit, very
dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;a bandit?&rdquo; the prince asked blearily. Mingullaq frowned. &ldquo;I
thought he was one of your people,&rdquo; the prince added hastily, suddenly
afraid that he was overdoing his act. &ldquo;I offered to help him move that
chest. He just seemed to be helping carry things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this yours?&rdquo; Mingullaq asked, eyeing the chest suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the prince said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whose it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mingullaq crouched down, undid the clasps that held the chest closed,
and lifted its lid. &ldquo;Did he say anything to you?&rdquo; he asked as he began
pulling clothes out of the chest and dropping them on the floor beside
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got the impression he didn&rsquo;t speak Garheimman very well,&rdquo; the
prince replied.</p>
<p>Mingullaq paused and glanced up at him. &ldquo;Because his sentences were
mixed together?&rdquo; At the prince&rsquo;s nod, Mingullaq scowled. &ldquo;Piqaluujaq
for sure,&rdquo; he said flatly. &ldquo;He learned some Garheimman magic, back
before our ancestors&rsquo; strength was returned to us. They say he traded
making sense to humans for the power to speak to birds and animals.&rdquo;
His narrowed eyes searched the prince&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;He is very dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am grateful to you for rescuing me,&rdquo; the prince said, standing and
bowing slightly. He gestured at the chest that lay between him and the
crouching Anuat. &ldquo;Have you found anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find nothing there except my undershirts and socks,&rdquo; Gudrun
said sharply from the doorway. She strode into the room and glared at
Mingullaq as the Anuat straightened up. &ldquo;Now, what I would like to find
is an explanation. I don&rsquo;t suppose you have seen one lying about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant no harm,&rdquo; Mingullaq said. &ldquo;His Highness was attacked by a
bandit, a renegade. He seemed interested in this chest, so I thought it
prudent to search it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bandit? Here?&rdquo; Gudrun studied the Anuat&rsquo;s face for a second, then
looked at the prince. &ldquo;Is this true?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>The prince shrugged. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if he was a bandit or not,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;But he did flee when he was challenged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you said that we would be safe here,&rdquo; Gudrun said to
Mingullaq.</p>
<p>The Anuat shrugged. &ldquo;I am embarrassed,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;And I apologize
for looking through your belongings in this way. I will replace
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need,&rdquo; Gudrun said curtly. &ldquo;I packed them the first
time, I can pack them again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Anuat nodded. &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I will put guards
around this house, so that this does not happen again. No, please,&rdquo; he
continued, raising his hands as Gudrun started to protest, &ldquo;It is a
shame upon my people that this has happened. You are guests. I must do
what I can to keep you safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke briefly in Anuat at one of the warriors on the landing, then
switched back to Garheimman. &ldquo;Sirmiqusaq will show you back to your
rooms,&rdquo; he said to Gudrun and the prince. &ldquo;And again, I am sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the prince sat silently on the second bed in the
room he and the Balance shared while she, Gudrun, and Nils digested
soup, bread, and the unexpected change in their circumstances. Nils was
the first to speak. &ldquo;Do you think it was planned?&rdquo; he asked the
prince. &ldquo;So that they would have an excuse to put guards around us
after all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say, Your Honor.&rdquo; Prince Evan replied. &ldquo;It may have been,
but Mingullaq seemed angry enough, and from the look on his face, I&rsquo;d
say that if the other Anuat had still been there when he returned, he
would have used that spear he was carrying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either way, they now have an excuse to keep us jarred up here like
eels,&rdquo; Gudrun said. She sighed and rose to her feet. &ldquo;The days up here
are long. We should all get as much sleep as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; Nils said, yawning as he also stood up. &ldquo;Your Grace, Your
Highness, good evening.&rdquo; He bowed, stepped to one side to let Gudrun
precede him through the door, and closed it behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me with my boots,&rdquo; Balance Petcharatiriv said after a moment of
silence. The prince knelt down in front of her and tugged the heavy
fur-lined mukluks off her feet. &ldquo;Ahhh,&rdquo; she sighed, wiggling her toes.
&ldquo;All these years, and I still miss the feel of grass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She opened her eyes and fixed them on the prince. &ldquo;Now, what <em>really</em>
happened?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>The prince hesitated, then softly said, &ldquo;All too many ears, this
place.&rdquo; He looked around the room meaningfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmph,&rdquo; the Balance said. She swung her legs up onto the bed. &ldquo;Well,
just remember, we&rsquo;re not here to take sides, and we&rsquo;re <em>definitely</em>
not here to create a side of our own.&rdquo; She settled back against the
bed&rsquo;s headboard, half sitting and half lying down. &ldquo;Give me an hour to
think,&rdquo; she said, closing her eyes, &ldquo;And then we&rsquo;ll talk about what
you saw and heard today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Your Grace,&rdquo; the prince said. He pulled off his own boots and
lay full-length on his bed. He had some thinking of his own to do.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>*</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The prince&rsquo;s mind was still whirling a half an hour later. Balance
Petcharatiriv&rsquo;s snoring didn&rsquo;t help matters. It wasn&rsquo;t especially
loud, but since she didn&rsquo;t snore with every breath, there was no way to
ignore it.</p>
<p>Finally the prince sighed, sat up, and pulled on his boots. Thinking
about Piqaluujaq made him think about Apple Bridge, which made him think
about Tahura, which he had been doing a lot anyway. As he slipped out of
the room, he told himself that he just wanted to find out what more she
knew about the mysterious Anuat. He did his best to ignore the other
reasons whispering at the back of his head.</p>
<p>Tahura and Miguella were sharing a room on the opposite side of the
Customs House. Prince Evan raised his hand to knock, then hesitated. He
was about to turn away when he heard Tahura&rsquo;s unmistakable giggle. He
smiled, knocked, and pushed the door open without waiting to be invited.</p>
<p>It took him a moment to make sense of what he saw. Tahura was standing
up as he walked in with a startled, almost guilty look on her face. Arne
was sitting in one of the room&rsquo;s two beds. He was half-covered by a
quilt, but his chest and arms were bare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evan&mdash;&rdquo; Tahura began, but the prince cut her off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; he asked Arne flatly.</p>
<p>The Garheimman&rsquo;s smile had vanished. &ldquo;What business is it of yours?&rdquo;
he asked bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh&mdash;&rdquo; The prince gulped. His face felt hot. &ldquo;I asked you a
question,&rdquo; he said harshly, raising his hand to cut off whatever Tahura
was trying to say. &ldquo;Now, <em>what are you doing here!?</em>&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought princes were supposed to have good manners,&rdquo; Arne replied,
his tone as cold as the prince&rsquo;s was hot. Only the Garheimman&rsquo;s blue
eyes betrayed his anger. &ldquo;So why don&rsquo;t you show us your manners,
<em>prince</em>, and leave us in peace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A strangled sound escaped from Evan&rsquo;s throat. Tahura shrieked, &ldquo;No,
Evan, stop!&rdquo; as he threw himself at Arne with murder in his heart. He
wrestled with the Garheimman for only a moment, then suddenly found
himself holding an armful of sleek, warm, angry fur. He yelped in shock
as whatever Arne had become twisted out of his arms and pounced on him.</p>
<p>An instant later, the prince was lying in a heap on the floor with the
hot, wet stink of a wolf&rsquo;s breath on his face. Tahura was saying, &ldquo;Get
off him, get off him!&rdquo; and tugging at the nape of the wolf&rsquo;s neck. The
wolf&rsquo;s teeth seemed very white against his long, red tongue and black
gums. His fur was the same blond color that Arne&rsquo;s hair had been, and
his eyes were the same startling blue. He growled a heartbeat longer,
then leaped off the prince onto the bed and burrowed under the quilt. A
moment later Arne sat up again, the quilt wrapped around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you think you were doing?&rdquo; Tahura demanded as the prince got
shakily to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; the prince wheezed miserably. His heart was still
pounding. He looked at the Garheimman, then looked away. &ldquo;I just&mdash;&rdquo;
He paused and took a deep breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My apologies,&rdquo; he said to Arne, bowing his head slightly. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t
aware that you were a child of two mothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No reason you should have been,&rdquo; the Garheimman said with a shrug.
&ldquo;And you might as well call me a &lsquo;werewolf&rsquo;, plain and simple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince bowed his head again. &ldquo;I still want to know what you thought
you were doing,&rdquo; Tahura asked. &ldquo;Arne and I were just talking. Someone
said that someone was attacked by bandits, and he was checking the
rooms. You shouldn&rsquo;t have&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was me,&rdquo; the prince told her, deciding as he spoke that he
wasn&rsquo;t going to tell her about Piqaluujaq, or the secret passage. &ldquo;One
of the Anuat asked me to help him carry a chest upstairs, and&hellip;&rdquo; He
trailed off. Balance Petcharatiriv had taught him how useful it
sometimes was to let other people finish his sentences. Just as he saw
the look on Tahura&rsquo;s face change from anger to concern, he continued,
&ldquo;But in any case, I&rsquo;m sorry I interrupted. If you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I
should get back to Her Grace.&rdquo; He bowed in the Garheimman style to
Arne, then to Tahura, then stepped out onto the landing and closed the
door. He stood there for a few moments, wondering what he would say if
Tahura came out after him. She didn&rsquo;t, though, so he straightened his
jacket and went back to his room.</p>

<p><em>The little boat made its way along the coast in darkness. This far
north, there were only a few hours each night when its captain could
travel in safety. He left the sail down, and instead he stood on the
deck with his arms spread, catching the wind himself. It was a simple
thing, now, but had taken many years to learn.</em></p>
<p><em>He brought the boat around another rocky point, no different from

<p>The next three days were the busiest of Prince Evan&rsquo;s life. The
northern sun never quite set, and it seemed that the Garheimmen and
Anuat never stopped arguing. They rose early, greeted the sun in a yard
behind the Customs House that had once held furs and stacks of lumber,
ate a quick breakfast of porridge and eggs, then sat down with the Anuat
at the long table that had been set up on the ground floor.</p>
<p>A large parchment map of Garheim, Anuvatik, and the islands took up the
center of the table. People drew on it with chalk, or pointed to it with
one hand while waving another. The Garheimmen produced treaties they had
signed with various Anuat bands during the early years of the conquest.
The Anuat rejected them, saying that they had been signed under duress,
or with drunkards, or that those bands were now gone, and their
obligations with them.</p>
<p>Mingullaq did most of the talking for the Anuat, although he and the
other chiefs often rose from the table to go and speak amongst
themselves. On the Garheimmen side, Nils spoke less than Prince Evan had
expected, and Gudrun more. Often, both just sat and let Finnbo or one of
the the other Garheimmen guild representatives ask a question, argue a
point, or suggest a compromise.</p>
<p>But it was Balance Petcharatiriv who suggested most of the compromises,
and kept everyone at the table when tempers grew short. Prince Evan
marvelled at her energy, and at her ability to find just the right
phrase to satisfy both sides, or remember an obscure precedent or custom
at just the right moment.</p>
<p>The talks ranged over who owned some minor islands (and what it meant to
&ldquo;own&rdquo; land, since the Anuat had no such concept before the Garheimmen
arrived), to fishing rights, the restoration of noble titles to the
family of a whale who had fought with the Anuat during the rebellion,
and responsibility for cleaning up some of the ugly spells left behind
by the war. Through all of it, Prince Evan stayed at the Balance&rsquo;s
side, fetching papers, reading aloud, and taking notes. They ate lunch
dried fish and flatbread as they worked, then broke each night for
dinner long after the prince&rsquo;s stomach started to grumble.</p>
<p>On the second day, the Balance, Nils, and Gudrun were invited to eat
dinner with Chief Agiuppinniq. The other Garheimmen, and the cloudherds,
set up a barbecue that night by laying slats of sea-soaked Arctic birch
over the coals of a fire in the yard behind the Customs House. Prince
Evan listened to them talk and laugh as he revised the notes he had made
that day. After a while he stopped pretending that he was reading what
was in front of him, and lay back on his bed with the pages on his
chest.</p>
<p>He hadn&rsquo;t spoken to Tahura since the scene in her room. He knew there
hadn&rsquo;t really been time&mdash;Balance Petcharatiriv needed him practically
all the time&mdash;but he also knew that he was avoiding thinking about her.
He had gone through those few moments again and again, imagining
different things he might have done or said, different ways it might
have turned out. Sooner or later, he knew, he was going to have to
apologize properly.</p>
<p>The voices out in the yard grew quieter as the evening wore on, then
went silent in ones and twos as people went back to their rooms. The
soldiers would walk patrol around the house in shifts through the night.
Gudrun had insisted on that, when Mingullaq had put Anuat warriors
there. The soldiers had seemed relieved to have something useful to do,
despite the cold. The cloudherds, on the other hand, were playing catch,
knitting, re-hashing old gossip, and growing very, very bored.</p>
<p>Suddenly the prince felt bored as well. He tucked his notes into the
polished wooden writing case his sister had given him for his birthday
and pulled on his boots. The landing was empty when he slipped out the
door. He walked quietly down to the corner, turned the handle as quietly
as he could, then put his shoulder against the door and leaned into it.
It stuck for a moment, then popped open. He glanced around&mdash;there was
no-one around to have heard.</p>
<p>Prince Evan slipped into the room that Piqaluujaq had vanished from and
closed the door behind himself. Nothing appeared to have been moved. He
took a deep breath, then another, and then stepped over to the
cubbyholes on the far wall. Piqaluujaq wind had been standing <em>here</em>, so
he must have put his hand <em>here</em> or <em>here</em>. The prince reached all the
way to the back of the first, but felt nothing.</p>
<p>When he reached into the second, his fingers found a loop of thick cord.
He closed his eyes for a second and muttered, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to do
this, you know,&rdquo; then grabbed the loop and pulled as hard as he could.
Something went <em>click</em>. The section of wall he was leaning on swung away
from him on a hidden set of hinges. He took another deep breath and
stepped into the secret passage.</p>
<p>It took his eyes a few moments to adjust to the gloom. It was more like
a secret closet than a secret passage, he saw. Fresh air and a little
bit of light came though a narrow gap between the top edge of one wall
and the ceiling. He wrinkled his nose at the smell of the droppings of
the birds who had found their way through that crack over the years, and
then had to scrape egg off his foot on the floorboards. There was a
square hole in the floor a few feet in front of him, barely wide enough
for a man in armor to squeeze through. A ladder made of a single sturdy
pole with crosspieces nailed on led down into the darkness.</p>
<p>The prince didn&rsquo;t notice that right away, though. What caught his eye
first were the parkas, skis, and packs piled neatly on either side of
him. They were Garheimman, and too supple beneath his probing fingers to
have been there for long. He hesitated only a heartbeat, then undid the
ties that held one of the packs shut and rooted through its contents.
Dried apples, hard cheese, sausages, tinder, bandages, a spare
knife&mdash;that much was what any soldier would carry. The gemstones,
sharks&rsquo; teeth, blue thread, doll-sized hat, and sweet-smelling herbs,
though, were a magician&rsquo;s. His stomach went cold.</p>
<p>He stuffed everything back in the pack as quickly as he could, but as he
turned back toward the secret door it swung open. The prince barely had
time to say, &ldquo;Who--&rdquo; before Arne&rsquo;s punch knocked the wind out of
him. He doubled over, gasping. The Garheimman wrapped a muscular arm
around the prince&rsquo;s neck and stuffed a rolled-up sock into his mouth,
then spun the prince around and pushed him up against the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quietly!&rdquo; the Garheimman hissed as he pulled the prince&rsquo;s arms back
and twisted a piece of twine around his wrists. He spun the prince
around again and kicked his feet away. The prince half-sat, half-fell on
the pack he had been examining, then slipped onto the floor.</p>
<p>Arne stood over him for a moment, breathing heavily, then muttered,
&ldquo;Blind your eyes, why&rsquo;d you have to go poking around?&rdquo; The prince
tried to spit out the sour-tasting wool sock to reply, but could not.</p>
<p>After a quick check of its contents, Arne put the pack the prince had
disturbed back on its pile. Then he stood looking down at the prince,
clearly not knowing what to do or say. They stared at each other for a
few heartbeats. Arne looked away first. He pulled another coil of twine
from one of his jacket&rsquo;s inside pockets, knotted it quickly around the
loop already holding the prince&rsquo;s wrists together, then tied the other
end to one of the prince&rsquo;s ankles. It would be comfortable enough as
long as he stayed on the floor, Prince Evan realized, but if he tried to
stand up, he would be doubled over. It would be hard enough to walk, let
alone run.</p>
<p>Whatever Arne might have done next was interrupted by the secret door
opening once again. Gudrun closed it behind herself and glared at the
young Garheimman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he doing here?&rdquo; she hissed.</p>
<p>Arne shrugged helplessly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I felt him step
on one of the eggs, and came straight away to see what was happening. He
was going through the packs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gudrun&rsquo;s glare shifted to Prince Evan. &ldquo;Oh, really? And what were
you&mdash;oh, take that thing out of his mouth.&rdquo; Arne pulled the sock from
the prince&rsquo;s mouth, but kept it ready in his hand as the prince made a
face and tried to scrape the woolly taste off the roof of his mouth with
his tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you looking for?&rdquo; Gudrun demanded. &ldquo;And how did you find
this place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince was surprised by how calm he felt. &ldquo;I think you had better
untie me,&rdquo; he said, looking straight into Gudrun&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t
going to take Balance Petcharatiriv very long to start wondering where I
am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gudrun made a small waving gesture with her hand, as if brushing away a
mosquito. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll worry about Her Grace later. Right now I want to know
what you were trying to do and who you are working for. Did she send
you? Are you spying for her? Or for someone else? You&rsquo;re not working
for the Anuat, are you?&rdquo; All expression left her face. The prince could
almost hear the wheels turning inside her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I truly hope you&rsquo;re not working for that undead abomination they
call a king,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;<em>That</em> would truly be unfortunate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince shook his head. &ldquo;I really think you ought to untie me,&rdquo; he
repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Arne said to Gudrun. &ldquo;The Balance is sure to&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what the Balance is sure to do,&rdquo; Gudrun snapped. &ldquo;Just let me
think for a moment.&rdquo; She turned back toward the door, as if she wanted
to pace up and down while she thought, but the secret room was too small
for her to take more than a couple of steps.</p>
<p>Eventually she sighed with frustration. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she said to Arne.
&ldquo;It just means we have to do things a little sooner than planned. Set
the markers up, then come back as quickly as you can. I&rsquo;ll tell Silk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince&rsquo;s jaw dropped as Arne nodded and began to strip off his
clothes. &ldquo;Silk?&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;The dragon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo; Gudrun said, not even really paying attention. She had
opened a different pack and taken a small cloth roll from it. As Arne
pulled off the last of his clothes and shifted with a grunt of familiar
pain into wolf form, Gudrun spread the cloth on the floor and sat down
in its center. She pulled a dark leather belt from the pack and did it
up around Arne&rsquo;s neck, then hooked a half dozen wooden carvings of
birds onto it. The prince could see that Arne would be able to pull them
off using only his paws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quick,&rdquo; she said to the wolf, &ldquo;Quick and quiet.&rdquo; Arne nodded his
sleek head, trotted over to the ladder, tensed himself for a moment,
then jumped into the hole in the floor. An instant later Prince Evan
heard the soft <em>thud</em> of four feet landing on hard earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is insane,&rdquo; the prince said loudly. &ldquo;Whatever you&rsquo;re trying to
do, it&rsquo;s&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo; Gudrun ordered. &ldquo;<em>Completely</em> quiet.&rdquo; She glanced up at
him. &ldquo;The spells on this room probably aren&rsquo;t strong enough to hide
the stink of a murder, but we&rsquo;d probably both rather not have to find
out.&rdquo; There was no more emotion in her voice than there would have been
if she had been talking to an eel.</p>
<p>The prince watched in silence as Gudrun took a small glass vial and a
sea shell from the pack. She pulled the stopper from the vial, poured a
few drops of dark blood onto the cloth in front of her, and then put the
stopper in her mouth and held the sea shell up to her ear. She closed
her eyes and waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she finally said, mumbling slightly around the piece of glass
that lay under her tongue. &ldquo;Yes. No. It has to be tonight.&rdquo; Pause.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been discovered.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, by the Balance&rsquo;s apprentice, but the
others will come looking for him soon.&rdquo; Pause. &ldquo;Yes, he is doing it
now. Yes, as you ordered.&rdquo; Frown. &ldquo;No, they&rsquo;re all here. They should
be asleep by then. The clouds are all east of town. They shouldn&rsquo;t see
you until it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo; Pause. &ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She opened her eyes and spat the glass stopper into her hand. She looked
at it for a second, then raised her eyes to meet the prince&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;And now we wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo; the prince asked. &ldquo;Do you really think that turning Ax
Medicine into a firepit will end this war?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gudrun glanced at him. &ldquo;I hope it won&rsquo;t be as dramatic as that,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to do any more damage than we have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We?&rdquo; The prince shifted slightly, unconsciously trying to find a
softer patch of floor. When Gudrun didn&rsquo;t answer, he continued, &ldquo;I
presume you mean the Clear Light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter who I mean,&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;This stupid war has
dragged on for forty years. It has to end. <em>We</em> have to end it, but as
long as these people are ruled by that, that, <em>abomination</em>, how can
there be peace?&rdquo; Her glare was so intense that the prince felt like a
piece of wood staring up at a drill. &ldquo;We have been here before, and you
cannot negotiate with monsters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Anuat probably feel the same way about you,&rdquo; the prince observed
quietly. For a moment he was sure that Gudrun was going to hit him, but
instead she bit back her anger and began to fold up the cloth she had
been sitting on.</p>

<p>An hour passed, more or less, and then the whole building seemed to
shake slightly. An instant later the prince heard a rumble of thunder.
Gudrun&rsquo;s head snapped up. Her eyes searched the ceiling, as if she
hoped to see through it. There was another rumble, and more shaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo; the prince whispered. Gudrun was on her feet.
Her hands were clenched into fists. Suddenly they heard boots on the
latter that led down from the hole in the floor opposite the secret
door. Gudrun snatched up a sword from one of the piles of equipment and
crouched, ready to lunge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s started,&rdquo; Arne gasped as his head poked up through the hole. He
clambered out of the hole, gasping for air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you set all of the markers?&rdquo; Gudrun demanded.</p>
<p>Arne shook his head. &ldquo;Just the first three,&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;There were
guards&mdash;the shaman was one of them. I had to crawl under a couple of
porches to shake them off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tears and blindness!&rdquo; Gudrun cursed. &ldquo;All right, get dressed. We may
have to finish this ourselves. And keep an eye on him,&rdquo; she added as an
afterthought, pointing her sword at Prince Evan. She pulled the secret
door open and vanished through it.</p>
<p>Prince Evan struggled to his feet as Arne began to pull on his clothes.
&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; the Garheimman asked him.</p>
<p>The prince studied him for a heartbeat, then said, &ldquo;She deserves better
than you, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arne hesitated, then continued to dress. &ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But
then, we all probably deserve better than we get.&rdquo; He straightened and
began to do up the ties on his shirt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry you had to get
involved in this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still not sure I know what &lsquo;this&rsquo; is,&rdquo; the prince replied.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to kill the Wrestler, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To end him,&rdquo; Arne corrected. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t kill what&rsquo;s already
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you really think that&rsquo;s worth the lives of everyone here?&rdquo; The
prince felt his anger glowing in his chest like the flame in a lamp.
&ldquo;Your people, Tahura, everyone else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arne finished tying up his shirt. He picked up his jacket, started to
shrug it on, then stopped himself and rounded on the prince. &ldquo;You have
no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;No idea at all.
Garheim was ground into bone meal for two hundred years by monsters like
him. These people are going to trade away the lives of their children,
their grandchildren, and their grandchildren&rsquo;s grandchildren, and for
what? For what? It doesn&rsquo;t matter how much damage we do here today, if
we save them from that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very noble speech,&rdquo; the prince sneered. &ldquo;Who wrote it for
you? Or is it just part of the Clear Light&rsquo;s usual patter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arne&rsquo;s face hardened. &ldquo;If it weren&rsquo;t for the Clear Light, the people
of Garheim would still be living like cattle, and people like <em>me</em> would
still be hunted as if we truly were animals. Now sit down and hold your
tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room shook again, harder than before. The rumble that followed was
loud enough to drown out any reply the prince might have made. Another
rumble came on its heels, then another, and then there were shouts in
Anuat from the bottom of the ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blind me,&rdquo; Arne cursed under his breath. He stepped over to stand
beside the hole in the floor and glanced down, pulling his head back
away from the hole almost immediately. An instant later an arrow went
<em>thunk!</em> into the ceiling above the hole.</p>
<p>The secret door burst open. Arne whirled, bringing up his sword, but it
was Gudrun. &ldquo;Out!&rdquo; she snarled. &ldquo;Now! And take him with you!&rdquo; She
pushed past Arne, pulling a parka from the pile of equipment beside him
as she went. With one deft motion she spread it over the hole like a
quilt on a bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; she shouted without looking back at the two young men. Arne
grabbed the prince&rsquo;s collar and pulled him through the door. Prince
Evan stumbled and almost went to his knees, but the Garheimman dragged
him back onto his feet without slowing down. The prince&rsquo;s knee banged
hard into the corner of one of the desks in the small office, and then
they were out onto the landing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait! Wait!&rdquo; the prince shouted, trying to dig his feet in to slow
them down. &ldquo;The Balance! I have to get Her Grace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arne hesitated, then nodded. He yanked the prince&rsquo;s hands forward and
rasped his sword through the twine that bound them. As the prince pulled
the twine away, Arne spun and kicked the door beside them at waist
height. &ldquo;Your Grace!&rdquo; he bellowed as the door burst open.</p>
<p>Prince Evan pushed past him. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not here,&rdquo; he said, turning back
to the door. &ldquo;She must&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>The far wall of the Customs House exploded inward in a gout of flame.
The blast knocked Prince Evan and Arne off their feet and threw them
through the air like straw dolls. Broken boards clattered against the
landing. The sound hit them like a wet sandbag.</p>
<p>The prince tried to get up, slipped, then got his feet under him. Arne
was still lying on his side, pawing weakly at the floor with one hand.
The prince dropped down onto his knees and shook him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arne! Arne!&rdquo; he said urgently. &ldquo;We have to get out of here.&rdquo;
Dragonfire clung to the hole that had been blasted in the wall. The
flames licked at its edges, growing stronger with each passing
heartbeat.</p>
<p>Arne got onto his hands and knees, then grabbed a handful of the
prince&rsquo;s jacket and pulled himself upright. His nose was bleeding, as
was a scrape on his forehead. &ldquo;Gudrun,&rdquo; he wheezed. &ldquo;We have to&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to get out of here!&rdquo; the prince repeated urgently. &ldquo;The
whole building&rsquo;s going to collapse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arne shook his head. He pushed the prince aside and stumbled toward the
door. Prince Evan grabbed his arm. Arne tried to push him away, but was
too weak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; the prince relented. &ldquo;Come on. But we have to hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prince Evan could feel the landing shifting under them as they made
their way back to the room with the secret door. There was smoke in the
air now, and they could hear angry, frightened shouts from outside. The
railing on the landing sagged loosely beneath his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Honor!&rdquo; Arne called weakly as he pushed past the desks and
through the secret door. &ldquo;Are you&mdash;Your Honor!&rdquo; For a moment Prince
Evan couldn&rsquo;t see anything except the Garheimman&rsquo;s back, but then Arne
knelt down. Gudrun was on her knees beside the hold in the floor. The
parka was gone. There was fresh blood on the floor, and more was leaking
from the wound in her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you to go,&rdquo; she gasped at Arne. When he took her shoulders and
tried to pull her back from the hole she shrugged him off. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she
said. Her voice was tight with pain. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re still down there. I have
to&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, everyone&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; Arne said urgently. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
all gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gudrun looked up at the younger Garheimman with bleary eyes. &ldquo;Did we do
it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said. He took her shoulders again and tried to get
her on her feet. &ldquo;Now <em>come on!</em>&ldquo;</p>
<p>Someone shouted in Anuat from below them. &ldquo;Help me!&rdquo; Arne said over
his shoulder to the prince. There was another shout down below. The
prince took Gudrun&rsquo;s good arm and helped Arne get her off her knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get her out onto the landing,&rdquo; Arne ordered the prince. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
right behind you.&rdquo; As Prince Evan walked Gudrun toward the door, Arne
started grabbing packs, parkas, and skis and throwing them down into the
hole. There were more shouts in Anuat. As the last of the packs tumbled
down, Arne threw back his head and howled.</p>
<p>The prince and Gudrun were halfway to the stairs when the landing
suddenly dropped a foot beneath them. The prince grabbed at the railing
as they fell backward. It was as loose in his hand as a pine branch. The
landing sagged again, and then somehow Arne was there, one hand on each
of their collars, pulling them back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to go up!&rdquo; the Garheimman shouted. &ldquo;The beams are all on
fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Black smoke was filling the air. Every breath caught in the prince&rsquo;s
throat. Gudrun swayed like a drunk on a small boat in a heavy storm, but
somehow, with Evan on one side, and Arne on the other, she managed to
keep moving. She finally collapsed halfway up the stairs to the roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get the door open,&rdquo; Arne ordered the prince. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to try to
jump onto the roof next door.&rdquo; He grabbed Gudrun&rsquo;s good arm, bent
down, and then stood up with a grunt with Gudrun slung over his
shoulders. He staggered up the stairs behind Prince Evan.</p>
<p>The hatch that led up onto the roof was jammed closed. The prince drove
his shoulder into it, then tried kicking at it, but the narrow stairs
were slippery, and the door was at an awkward angle above him.</p>
<p>With Arne cursing behind him, the prince tried his shoulder again. This
time the door squeaked and gave way a fingernail&rsquo;s width. He thumped it
again, and again, until finally it burst open.</p>
<p>The cedar shingles on the roof had been bleached gray by decades of sun,
snow, and neglect. The prince scrambled sideways to get clear of the
door, then clutched at Gudrun as Arne rolled her off his shoulders onto
the steeply-pitched roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what?&rdquo; the prince panted. &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; Arne shouted. Half a dozen buildings were on fire
around them. Anuat voices were shouting on the street below them. Prince
Evan saw three people in parkas run across the main street fifty yards
away, with a four person following close behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to jump,&rdquo; Arne said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a couple of stories.
You go first so you can catch Gudrun. I&rsquo;ll lower her as far as I can
before I drop her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince hesitated. &ldquo;What about the Anuat?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no
way she can get away from them, not like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better odds than staying here,&rdquo; Arne replied grimly. &ldquo;Besides, what
are you worried about? You&rsquo;re with the Balance. You ought to be safe
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope the Anuat remember that,&rdquo; the prince muttered. He took a
deep breath and started to slide down toward the edge of the roof.</p>
<p>Just as he reached the edge he heard Tahura shout, &ldquo;Evan!&rdquo; He twisted
onto his stomach and spread-eagled to stop from sliding. A cloud was
racing toward the burning Customs House, quick and low. Tahura was
crouched at its edge, waving and shouting. As the prince watched, an
arrow shot up through the cloud. It flinched, bunching its edges and
swerving, but kept coming.</p>
<p>The prince scrambled back up toward Arne and Gudrun as Arne began
pulling Gudrun up toward the peak of the roof. The prince pushed on her
rump while Arne pulled on her good arm. The wound in her arm left a
smear of blood behind her on the roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; Tahura shouted at them. The cloud swept down and thumped into
the roof. Arne pulled his legs underneath him, grabbed Gudrun like a
sack of potatoes, and <em>heaved</em>. The two Garheimmen tumbled onto the edge
of the cloud, but immediately started sliding back down. Prince Evan
caught Gudrun&rsquo;s feet in his hands and braced her long enough for Arne
to claw his way back up beside Tahura and pull Gudrun up as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; Arne shouted, lying flat and thrusting his arm out at the
prince. Evan grabbed it and leaped up as Arne hauled him in. The cloud
was already rising. Another arrow went <em>sfffft!</em> an arm&rsquo;s length away,
and then they were too high for the Anuat bows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the others?&rdquo; Prince Evan shouted to Tahura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They all scattered!&rdquo; she yelled back. &ldquo;The clouds were going
crazy!&rdquo; She furrowed her brow. &ldquo;Pearl says someone is bleeding! She
can taste it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Gudrun,&rdquo; Arne said. &ldquo;Her arm&rsquo;s been hurt.&rdquo; As he spoke, he
finished cutting away the sleeve of Gudrun&rsquo;s jacket. The arm of her
shirt was soak with blood. With two quick twists of his wrist, Arne cut
the sleeve as well, as smoothly as if he were gutting a fish. He twisted
it up tight, then tied it tightly around Gudrun&rsquo;s arm just above the
gash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she going to be all right?&rdquo; Prince Evan asked. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s lost a lot
of blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arne shook his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the blood I&rsquo;m worried about,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Look here.&rdquo; He turned Gudrun&rsquo;s head gently and pointed at a
bruise on her temple. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if she got that in the fight, or
if we bumped her into something on the way out, but she shouldn&rsquo;t be
out like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began to pull off his jacket. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; Tahura
demanded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll freeze!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as quickly as she will,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you taking us?&rdquo; the prince interrupted. &ldquo;I have to find
Her Grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must still be in Ax Medicine,&rdquo; Tahura said. Now that the
immediate need to act was gone, the frantic look on her face was giving
way to fear and fatigue. &ldquo;We&mdash;we heard Pearl and the other clouds
panic. We ran out to see what was happening, but it was&mdash;everything was
already on fire.&rdquo; Her eyes were wide. &ldquo;Evan, I saw a <em>dragon</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; the prince replied absently as he watched Arne wrap his
jacket around Gudrun, and then start to pull off his shirt as well.
&ldquo;His name is Silk. Gudrun and Arne made some kind of bargain with him
to attack the Anuat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Tahura gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what happened, and you know it,&rdquo; Arne grunted, struggling
to lift Gudrun so that he could slip his shirt underneath her. &ldquo;He
wasn&rsquo;t after the Anuat, he was after the Wrestler. We knew he&rsquo;d be in
Ax Medicine somewhere while the talks were going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo; means the Clear Light,&rdquo; the prince explained to Tahura, as if
he were teaching a small child how to spell. &ldquo;Not me, I mean, but him.
When he says &lsquo;we&rsquo;, he means the Clear Light.&rdquo; He felt lightheaded,
and suddenly realized that he was shivering. Arne was too&mdash;his bare
torso was covered in goosebumps.</p>
<p>Tahura was staring at Arne. &ldquo;Arne&mdash;dragons <em>eat</em> clouds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Garheimman looked away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Would you look
after her for a moment?&rdquo; he asked. At the cloudherd&rsquo;s nod, he stood up
and walked to the other side of the cloud.</p>
<p>The prince watched over Tahura&rsquo;s shoulder while Arne stripped off the
rest of his clothes. &ldquo;Evan, what happened?&rdquo; Tahura asked quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;There was a secret room in the
Customs House. I&mdash;Tahura, the Anuat they say attacked me, he didn&rsquo;t
really attack me at all. It was Piqaluujaq, from Apple Bridge. Remember?
He was selling seal furs, and&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;and he was looking for the plague that killed all the dogs,&rdquo; she
finished. &ldquo;What was he doing in Ax Medicine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that either.&rdquo; Prince Evan snorted bitterly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
seem to know very much about what&rsquo;s going on, do I?&rdquo; Arne had just
peeled off his underclothes and added them to the pile at his side. As
the prince watched, he stretched and shifted into wolf form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tahura, listen,&rdquo; the prince said in a quiet, urgent voice. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
say anything about this to Arne. Do you understand? I don&rsquo;t know why he
was here, but I think it&rsquo;s important. I <em>have</em> to find Balance
Petcharatiriv.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tahura hesitated a heartbeat, then nodded. Prince Evan got up and went
to collect Arne&rsquo;s clothes as the blond wolf padded over to Tahura&rsquo;s
side. She put her arm around his neck and stroked his thick fur as he
licked gently at Gudrun&rsquo;s face. After a moment, Arne shook off
Tahura&rsquo;s arm and lay down beside Gudrun to help keep her warm.</p>

<p><em>He stretched and sighed. &ldquo;Sing them here,&rdquo; he said to the man who had
greeted him on the beach. &ldquo;I will sleep.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>The man nodded. Dawn came slowly, this far north, but it came
nonetheless. As his companion rolled over and closed his eyes, he took
two small bones from a leather bag that hung around his neck and began
to chant a slow song in a heartbeat rhythm.</em></p>

<p>They flew on in silence. Tahura sat in her usual place at the front of
Pearl, mind-speaking to the cloud occasionally to keep her calm. Arne
lay beside Gudrun with his fur fluffed up against the wind that was
gradually growing stronger around them. The prince sat and shivered a
few feet away with his knees drawn up under his chin.</p>
<p>It took Prince Evan a moment to realize that Tahura had spoken. &ldquo;Excuse
me?&rdquo; he said, raising his head slightly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, we&rsquo;re going to have to land,&rdquo; Tahura repeated. Her teeth
were chattering. &ldquo;Pearl&rsquo;s g-g-getting tired, and I ca-can&rsquo;t take
m-much more of this c-cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arne stood up and whined softly. Prince Evan nodded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;We should land and try to make a fire.&rdquo; His stomach churned
noisily. &ldquo;And some food,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Tahura tried to smile. &ldquo;I guess I should have brought some roast duck,
and a few apples,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The prince tried to smile back. &ldquo;Or some quilts and one of those pot
stoves the reeve of Bollesund mentioned.&rdquo; His half-smile faded.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have to go back, you know. We&rsquo;ll freeze if we stay
out here, and Gudrun&hellip;&rdquo; He trailed off.</p>
<p>Arne growled softly. He had lifted his head slightly as they spoke.
&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; the prince continued stubbornly. &ldquo;You and Pearl
might be all right in this cold, but Tahura and I aren&rsquo;t, and neither
is Gudrun. She needs a doctor, and unless we happen to fly over some
Anuat who don&rsquo;t know there&rsquo;s a war on, we&rsquo;re going to be very cold,
and very hungry, very soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tahura nodded, her head practically shivering up and down. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll s-see
if I can f-find us somep-place out of th-the wind,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The prince hugged his knees more tightly. &ldquo;This is why you had all that
stuff in the room I found, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said to Arne. &ldquo;You knew you
were going to have to make a run for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes narrowed. &ldquo;But how did you get it there? Someone would have
noticed if you&rsquo;d brought that much gear, and then made it disappear.
Was it one of the Anuat?&rdquo; Arne whined softly. &ldquo;The one who was
carrying the chest?&rdquo; The wolf whined again.</p>
<p>The prince pursed his lips, as if he had bitten into something sour.
&ldquo;It figures,&rdquo; he said bitterly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like Her Grace says. There&rsquo;s
never only two sides in anything.&rdquo; He looked straight into the wolf&rsquo;s
eyes. &ldquo;I swear, if anything happens to Tahura, I&rsquo;ll use your hide as a
rug for the rest of my life. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wolf blinked slowly, then lowered his head back onto his paws, his
eyes still on the prince&rsquo;s. The prince was the first one to look away.</p>
<p>A few minutes later Tahura said, &ldquo;I think I see a place. Over there.&rdquo;
The prince got to his feet awkwardly and went to stand beside her.
&ldquo;See?&rdquo; she said, pointing. &ldquo;Between those two eskers, there and
there. They ought to keep us out of the wind. And there&rsquo;s some
driftwood on the beach we can use for a fire. The current must drop it
when it crosses that shoal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your word for it,&rdquo; he said. Pearl was already descending
into the long shadows of the mountains to the south and west.</p>
<p>They touched down on spongy, mossy grass. Tiny blue and white flowers
were scattered across the landscape like handfuls of beads thrown by
children and never picked up. The prince and Tahura slid down the side
of the cloud, then turned to catch Gudrun as Arne lowered her limp
figure to them. He had changed back into human form as they landed, and
pulled on his pants and boots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get some firewood,&rdquo; the prince said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much point unless you brought some tinder,&rdquo; Arne grunted. He
lowered Gudrun onto his parka, which Tahura had spread on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oops. I knew I forgot something,&rdquo; the prince replied sarcastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you make a fire?&rdquo; Tahura asked Arne.</p>
<p>The Garheimman shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only a werewolf,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not
a magician.&rdquo; He glanced up at the sky, which had finally grown dark,
and shivered.</p>
<p>When he looked at Tahura, his expression was bleak. &ldquo;I think His
Highness might be right. I think we might have to go back to Ax
Medicine. We&rsquo;ll all freeze if we can&rsquo;t get a fire started, and even if
we do, Gudrun probably won&rsquo;t make it through the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince&rsquo;s mouth fell open. &ldquo;Well, this is a <em>fine</em> time to realize
that!&rdquo; he exploded. &ldquo;Thank you <em>very</em> much! Why couldn&rsquo;t you have
done that little bit of thinking two hours ago? We&rsquo;ll probably all
freeze before we get <em>back</em> to town!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arne straightened up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of your whining,&rdquo; he growled.
&ldquo;Tahura! Can Pearl get us back to town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tahura had a stricken expression on her face. She closed her eyes
briefly, then opened them and shook her head. &ldquo;Not without a rest,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to stay here for the night whether we want to or
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless you really want to,&rdquo; a soft voice said from out of
nowhere. Arne and Prince Evan whirled around. A slim figure was standing
beside the cloud&rsquo;s, one hand resting gently on her flank. He stepped
out of the shadow and bowed slightly. &ldquo;You would be very welcome to
join my companion and I. We have a fire, and food, and I dare say I
might be able to do something for your friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Tahura or the prince could move or speak, Arne yelled,
&ldquo;Monster!&rdquo; and shifted into wolf form. He struggled frantically for a
moment to pull his legs free of his pants, then launched himself at the
newcomer. The stranger tsked and stepped into Arne&rsquo;s lunge, catching
two hundred pounds of blond wolf in his arms as easily as he would have
caught a child&rsquo;s ball, then turning and throwing Arne up onto Pearl&rsquo;s
back.</p>
<p>Arne twisted in mid-air to land on his feet. He leaped down off the
cloud at the stranger once again. The newcomer caught him again, but
instead of throwing the wolf, he dropped down onto one knee, wrapping
his arm around Arne&rsquo;s neck in a headlock. &ldquo;Bad dog,&rdquo; he hissed.
&ldquo;Bad, bad dog.&rdquo; He squeezed, gently but firmly, until Arne&rsquo;s throat
closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that!&rdquo; Tahura shouted. &ldquo;Let him go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The newcomer looked up at her with smiling eyes. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he
agreed. He took his arms from the choking wolf&rsquo;s neck and rose to his
feet. Arne gasped for air as he shifted back into human form.</p>
<p>Tahura scooped up Arne&rsquo;s clothes and threw them to him. Prince Evan
just stood where he was, studying the stranger. He was half a head
shorter than the prince, with almond-shaped eyes and a small, flat nose.
He might have been Anuat, except he was slim rather than stocky. He wore
only a pair of light cotton pants, a knee-length cloak of some soft
colorless material, and a long-sleeved shirt&mdash;no boots, no gloves, and
no jacket.</p>
<p>As Arne pulled his pants on, Prince Evan nodded at the stranger. &ldquo;I
apologize for my companion&rsquo;s hastiness,&rdquo; he said politely. &ldquo;Your
offer of food and a fire is most welcome. I don&rsquo;t know why he would
have&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You idiot!&rdquo; Arne spat, stepping between the stranger and Gudrun as he
stood up. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you smell it? It&rsquo;s dead! It&rsquo;s a weeping blind-eyed
vampire!&rdquo; He looked for all the world as though he was about to throw
himself at the newcomer again.</p>
<p>The newcomer bowed his head slightly. &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;Allow me
to introduce myself. The name of my name is Bokchang Tzen Urpatnati
Halprilar. You may call me Tzen Ma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call you a weeping bloodsucker, is what I&rsquo;ll call you!&rdquo; Arne
raged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arne!&rdquo; the prince snapped, not taking his eyes from the newcomer.
&ldquo;Be quiet. You&rsquo;re not being helpful.&rdquo; He returned Tzen Ma&rsquo;s slight
bow. &ldquo;As I said, your offer of food and a fire is most welcome. We have
travelled a long way, and as you can see, our companion is injured. Is
your camp far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tzen Ma&rsquo;s nostrils flared momentarily. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;You smell
of the Marches. Ensworth, yes? The royal family? You are one of
Michael&rsquo;s boys, are you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prince Evan hesitated. &ldquo;I am Evan Prince Ensworth, the son of Peter
King Ensworth,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I had a grand-uncle named
Michael&mdash;perhaps you are thinking of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, no,&rdquo; the vampire replied. &ldquo;This would be before his time as
well. The Michael I have in mind was a colonel when the sky fell. I
think perhaps he founded your family&rsquo;s fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prince Evan hesitated again, then bowed his head once more. &ldquo;I am
honored that there is still some of him in me after so many years,&rdquo; he
said, wondering uneasily how the conversation had strayed so quickly
onto how he smelled.</p>
<p>The vampire smiled. &ldquo;Thank you. In answer to your question, my
companion and I are on the other side of the ridge behind you. If the
young lady would have the cloud follow us, I will lead you there. I
would be happy to carry Astrid&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;You must all
be very tired, and it would be only a slight burden for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare touch her,&rdquo; Arne warned. &ldquo;I swear, I&rsquo;ll put that
rotten corpse of yours in the ground where it belongs if you even try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tzen Ma&rsquo;s smile widened. &ldquo;Yes? Well, we have seen where that leads,
haven&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; He took a step toward the werewolf.</p>
<p>Prince Evan stepped hastily between them. &ldquo;Wait, please,&rdquo; he said to
the vampire, then turned to Arne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t stop him,&rdquo; he said quietly. Arne was looking over his
shoulder, his nose wrinkled in a sneer of distaste. He didn&rsquo;t seem to
hear the prince&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arne, you <em>can&rsquo;t</em>,&rdquo; Prince Evan repeated. He put his hands on the
Garheimman&rsquo;s shoulders, but Arne shrugged them off angrily. &ldquo;He could
probably carry all four of us if he had to. This is not the time, or the
place. We have to get Gudrun warmed up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arne, please,&rdquo; Tahura pleaded. The werewolf stood his ground a moment
longer, then made a growling noise deep in his throat and turned away.</p>
<p>Tzen Ma picked up Gudrun and cradled her in his arms like a mother
holding a sleeping child. For an instant Prince Evan was afraid the
vampire would do something horrible, like lick the blood from Gudrun&rsquo;s
wounded arm, but he appeared to ignore it. &ldquo;This way, please,&rdquo; he said
to the other three, and then set off at a brisk walking pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is strange luck that we landed here, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; the prince said,
hurrying despite his longer legs to keep up with the vampire. Arne and
Tahura were walking side by side behind them, while Pearl crept along a
few feet above the ground further back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, luck,&rdquo; Tzen Ma said. His voice was as steady as if he was sitting
in a comfortable chair. The prince realized with a shock that the
vampire wasn&rsquo;t actually breathing, except to get enough air into his
lungs to speak. &ldquo;Luck is like a very supple branch, that can be bent
into any manner of shapes. My companion, for example, has been singing
songs all day to bend your luck our way.&rdquo; He smiled. &ldquo;It is wonderful,
is it not? That there are so many different ways to make magic? So many
different things to see and learn in this world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I have never really given it much thought,&rdquo; the prince
replied. Then he had to stop talking so that he could scramble up the
packed gravel side of the esker.</p>
<p>Tzen Ma&rsquo;s camp was nestled against the other side. A single large tent
lay low against the tundra, with smoke rising from a hole at its peak.
&ldquo;But&mdash;I should have seen this from the air as we were landing,&rdquo;
Tahura said quietly to Arne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mmph,&rdquo; the werewolf grunted. &ldquo;And I should have smelled the fire.
But Bokchang Tzen was one of the most powerful magicians in the Pale
Remainder. He could have hidden all of this with just a wave of his
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, I really do prefer Tzen Ma these days,&rdquo; the vampire said,
loudly but pleasantly, from ten feet in front of them. Arne raised his
upper lip in a silent snarl.</p>
<p>Tahura gave him a few steps to calm down. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard of him?&rdquo; she
whispered.</p>
<p>The werewolf nodded. &ldquo;There were never more than twenty-eight vampires
in the whole of Garheim,&rdquo; he replied, also whispering. &ldquo;When the Clear
Light chose me, I had to learn about all of them&mdash;their names, their
histories, where they were from, their habits, everything. This one was
the one we knew least about. No-one is even sure where it was born, or
where it died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because no-one ever thought to ask,&rdquo; Tzen Ma said. Tahura saw
the prince give the vampire a startled glance, not having heard the
conversation behind him. She looked at Arne, who put a finger to his
lips. They walked the rest of the way to the tent in silence.</p>

<p>Piqaluujaq was sitting cross-legged at the mouth of the tent when they
arrived. A small skin drum and a half-eaten piece of dried jerky lay on
the moss beside him. He grinned at them and waggled a pair of small
bones. &ldquo;Grandmother sing long time, sing you the waves this place,&rdquo; he
said gravely to Tahura and the prince as he stood up. &ldquo;Sing she sweet
blood smell, the wet beneath.&rdquo; He touched Gudrun&rsquo;s arm hesitantly,
then bent his head down and sniffed at her wound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I regret the haste, but if she is to be healed, she must be healed
quickly,&rdquo; Tzen Ma ordered crisply, handing Gudrun to Piqaluujaq. The
Anuat shaman nodded and ducked into the tent with her in his arms.</p>
<p>Tzen Ma turned to the others with Gudrun still in his arms. &ldquo;Be welcome
in this place,&rdquo; he said formally. &ldquo;Warm yourselves, and eat. You have
a long way to go tomorrow, and will have to start early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going anywhere with you,&rdquo; Arne growled, but the vampire had
already followed Piqaluujaq into the tent.</p>
<p>Prince Evan didn&rsquo;t know what he expected to find inside, but it
certainly wasn&rsquo;t the sight that greeted his eyes. Like all Anuat tents,
this one&rsquo;s walls and floor were made of caribou hides stitched tightly
together to hold in the heat. The floor, however, was covered by a pair
of heavy carpets, one green with a pattern woven into it in red and
gold, the other black with silver and sky blue. Matching boxy cushions
were scattered around the floor to sit on.</p>
<p>A wrought iron brazier filled with hot coals squatted in the center of
the tent. The prince could feel its heat splash on his face like a
bucketful of warm water the moment he stepped inside. A lacquered wooden
table, no more than a foot high, stood next to the brazier. The polished
wooden plates on it bore smoked salmon, dark flatbread, small pots of
gooseberry and blackberry jam, and a bowl of mussels, their shells still
glistening with sea-damp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, help yourselves,&rdquo; Tzen Ma urged, smiling. &ldquo;If you wait for
me to dine first, you will have to wait a very long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arne growled again. Prince Evan and Tahura hesitated. Piqaluujaq had
laid Gudrun down on a blanket laid on top of one of the carpets, and was
setting small stone carvings in a circle around her. &ldquo;Is there anything
we can do to help?&rdquo; the prince asked.</p>
<p>Tzen Ma spread his hands helplessly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure my companion will do
everything that can be done,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I would help myself, but&mdash;&rdquo;
he shrugged. &ldquo;Sadly, healing is not an aptitude of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Piqaluujaq set the last of the carvings down near Gudrun&rsquo;s head, then
looked up at the prince. &ldquo;Eat,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;Long time I sing.&rdquo; He
turned back to the wounded Garheimman, took a deep breath, and began
crooning under his breath.</p>
<p>With a guilty feeling in his heart, the prince saw down in front of the
low table. Tahura sat down beside him a moment later, but Arne stayed on
his feet with his arms crossed, glaring at the back of the Anuat
shaman&rsquo;s head. Prince Evan plucked a piece of salmon from one plate,
laid it carefully on a flatbread, and handed it to Tahura. She nodded
her thanks and took half of it in her first bite. The prince was already
dribbling jam onto a second piece for himself.</p>
<p>Evan and Tahura didn&rsquo;t stop eating until only a scrap of bread, a
couple of smears of jam, and the mussel shells were left. Tahura asked
Arne to join them several times, but the Garheimman just shook his head.
Through it all, Tzen Ma sat placidly on a cushion, apparently enjoying
the sight of his breathing guests stuffing themselves. Piqaluujaq sang
and sang, changing neither his tone nor his rhythm.</p>
<p>When the shaman&rsquo;s chant finally ended, Arne uncrossed his arms and
stepped over the lacquered table. He looked down at Gudrun, who had not
moved from the moment she was brought into the tent, and asked, &ldquo;Will
she be all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Anuat shrugged. &ldquo;Her red river flowing, is gentle waves. This&hellip;&rdquo;
He touched the bruise on her temple. &ldquo;Far away sad.&rdquo; He looked up at
the Garheimman. &ldquo;Sing so loud, and she hear,&rdquo; he tried to explain.
&ldquo;Sing too soft, not hearing. Sing too loud, and like little geese she
fly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arne nodded as if he understood, then turned back to speak to Tahura and
the prince. &ldquo;Can you watch her for a while?&rdquo; he asked. His voice was
steady, but there was an ocean of pain in his eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get
some dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make sure nothing happens to her,&rdquo; Tahura promised softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Arne replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back when the sun&rsquo;s up.&rdquo; He
paused, swallowed, and then shook his head. As he stepped past Tahura,
he rested his hand on her shoulder for an instant. It took him only a
moment to slip off his clothes, and then he was gone.</p>
<p>Piqaluujaq sighed heavily once the tent flap had closed behind the
Garheimman. &ldquo;The sleep, maybe,&rdquo; he said to Prince Evan. &ldquo;Soon she
hears, or flies.&rdquo; He turned around, pushed a cushion out of his way,
and stretched out. A moment later he was snoring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sounds like Her Grace,&rdquo; Prince Evan said to Tahura. &ldquo;Maybe a
softer wood, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince shrugged. &ldquo;When the Balance snores, it sounds like someone
sawing through a tough old piece of wood with lots of knots in it.
Whatever he&rsquo;s sawing through sounds a bit softer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Tahura fell silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was meant to be a joke,&rdquo; the prince told her gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do that a lot,&rdquo; Tahura replied absently. &ldquo;Tell jokes, I mean.
Whenever something&rsquo;s gone wrong, you try to make a joke out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince shrugged. &ldquo;Seems more sensible than crying, or kicking
something. My brother is a big one for kicking things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tahura smiled. &ldquo;I remember. And Sophie just says, &lsquo;oh&rsquo;, and goes off
and does something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince cleared his throat. &ldquo;Speaking of Her Grace,&rdquo; he began,
turning his head to look at Tzen Ma, but the vampire had vanished. He
looked the other way, then shrugged again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like we&rsquo;re on our own,&rdquo; he said to Tahura. She blinked, then
glanced around. Her mouth made a little &lsquo;o&rsquo; when she realized that
their host was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we should get some sleep as well,&rdquo; Prince Evan continued
after a heartbeat&rsquo;s silence. Neither of them moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to go first?&rdquo; Tahura said after a few moments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To sleep?&rdquo; The prince frowned. &ldquo;I suppose that would be a good idea.
One of us should stay awake in case Gudrun&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Tahura interrupted gently. &ldquo;Not to sleep. To apologize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prince Evan looked down at the carpet beneath them. &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he finally
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;ve been such a camel. It&rsquo;s none of my business
who you spend your time with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it is,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m sorry I was&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. I
wasn&rsquo;t being very nice about it.&rdquo; She wrinkled her nose. &ldquo;I think
you&rsquo;d like him, you know? I mean, before all this happened,&rdquo; she added
hastily. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a lot of stories, and he&rsquo;s really funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo; The prince slid off the cushion he was sitting on and
leaned back against it with his hands behind his head. &ldquo;He certainly
seems devoted to Gudrun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo; Tahura glanced over at the sleeping Garheimman. Except for the
slow, shallow rise and fall of her chest, she might have been made of
wax. &ldquo;Kind of like you and Sergeant Crimes, remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the prince didn&rsquo;t answer, she tsked and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I
shouldn&rsquo;t have&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; the prince interrupted. He folded his arms across
his chest, as if he were cold. &ldquo;I still miss him sometimes, you know?
After&mdash;after my mother died, I used to follow him around everywhere
like a duckling.&rdquo; The prince smiled. &ldquo;Every time he was sent
somewhere, and I couldn&rsquo;t be with him, I&rsquo;d scream and scream. Finally
the captain of the guard just gave up and made him my bodyguard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father must have been very jealous,&rdquo; Tahura said.</p>
<p>Evan shrugged. &ldquo;He was always busy with other things, I suppose. I
didn&rsquo;t see much of him, except in court.&rdquo; He frowned slightly. &ldquo;I
think Colin saw him even less. He was away for two of Colin&rsquo;s birthdays
in a row, I remember that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember ever having a birthday with my father,&rdquo; Tahura
replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not even sure I remember him. I&rsquo;ve heard stories about
him from my gram, and I saw him a couple of times when he was working
for Fat Andre. Sometimes I think that what I&rsquo;m remembering is those
stories, and not anything that really happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She slid off her own cushion onto the floor and shuffled over to the
prince&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;What&mdash;&rdquo; he started, but, &ldquo;Sh,&rdquo; she said. She put
her head in the slight hollow between the ball of his shoulder and his
chest. He hesitated for a heartbeat, then put his arm around her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember this,&rdquo; she said, so quietly that he almost didn&rsquo;t hear
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; he whispered back. He ran his fingers over her hair,
marvelling as he always did at how soft it was. He kissed the top of her
head, then settled back against the cushion. A few moments later they
were both sound asleep.</p>

<p>It was Gudrun who woke them, an hour or so later. Tahura opened bleary
eyes and went, &ldquo;Uh?&rdquo; as the Garheimman shook her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh,&rdquo; Gudrun hissed into Tahura&rsquo;s ear. As the prince started to sit
up, Gudrun put her hand over his mouth to quiet him. &ldquo;Where are we?
What has happened? And who is <em>he</em>?&rdquo; She pointed her thumb over her
shoulder at Piqaluujaq, who was still sound asleep on the carpet a few
feet away.</p>
<p>The prince shook her hand off. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a couple of hours from Ax
Medicine as the cloud flies,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;You were hurt&mdash;your head
as well as your arm. You weren&rsquo;t waking up. Piqaluujaq used his magic
to guide us here, and then healed you.&rdquo; The prince studied Gudrun. The
bruise on her temple was still there, but had already faded slightly.
She was cradling her wounded arm with her good one, her fingers
absent-mindedly stroking the improvised bandage.</p>
<p>Gudrun&rsquo;s eyes were still narrow. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Arne?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;And
what is all of this&mdash; this&mdash; stuff? It doesn&rsquo;t look like any Anuat
tent I&rsquo;ve ever heard of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your companion was down by the beach, inspecting my boat, the last I
saw of his, Astrid&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo; a mellow voice said from the tent&rsquo;s
entrance. &ldquo;And as for this &lsquo;stuff&rsquo;, as you call it, the carpets and
table are mine. The carpets are, alas, only replicas, but the table is
from my homeland, and I treasure it dearly.&rdquo; Tzen Ma stepped into the
tent, letting the flap fall shut behind him, and bowed formally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Gudrun asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The name of my name is Bokchang Tzen Urpatnati Halprilar,&rdquo; Tzen Ma
replied. &ldquo;But you may call me&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>To Prince Evan&rsquo;s astonishment, Gudrun laughed, a short bark like a seal
might make. &ldquo;No you&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; she said dismissively. &ldquo;Bokchang Tzen
was destroyed at Bollesund. Who are you really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One moment the vampire was standing at the tent&rsquo;s entrance, and then
next he was in front of Gudrun. She took a startled step backward,
nearly tripping over Tahura and the prince. &ldquo;But you may call me Tzen
Ma,&rdquo; the vampire continued, his tone still polite. &ldquo;And I must inform
you, Bokchang Tzen was not destroyed at Bollesund, or anywhere else. He
just decided that it was time for a change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monster,&rdquo; Gudrun breathed. She snatched up a bowl from the lacquered
table, spilling mussel shells on the carpet, and flung it at Tzen Ma.
The vampire caught it easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monster!&rdquo; Gudrun screamed. As he and Tahura struggled to their feet,
the prince saw her tense herself, as if she was going to leap at the
vampire, bad arm and all. Before she could move, Tzen Ma produced a
feather from the sleeve of his jacket and blew gently over it in
Gudrun&rsquo;s direction. The Garheimman sneezed explosively, then again, and
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is truly a horrible end,&rdquo; Tzen Ma said conversationally as
Gudrun&rsquo;s whole body shook with the force of her sneezes. &ldquo;Exhaustion
sets in after only a few hours, and it is so&hellip; undignified.&rdquo; He held
out the feather. Gudrun turned away, still sneezing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; the vampire urged, like a dinner host trying to persuade a
guest to eat one more strawberry.</p>
<p>Prince Evan took the feather from Tzen Ma&rsquo;s hand, and held it out to
Gudrun. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to be able to do anything
in that state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;aschluh!&rdquo; Gudrun snatched the feather from Prince Evan. Her
sneezing stopped instantly, although her eyes still watered and her face
was still red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, is that the sort of thing a monster would do?&rdquo; Tzen Ma asked
gently. &ldquo;I really&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to get out of here,&rdquo; Gudrun said to the prince and Tahura,
her tone almost frantic. &ldquo;We have to warn people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tzen Ma sucked in some air, held it for a moment, and then let it out in
a long, theatrical sigh. &ldquo;&lsquo;Even the blind fish in caves remember the
light&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said, as if he were quoting poetry.</p>
<p>Gudrun gaped at him. The vampire smiled. &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d like that.
How about this one? &lsquo;Even a small coin may reflect the sun.&rsquo; That was
a particular favorite of mine&mdash;it&rsquo;s quite a clever pun, in my first
language. Of course, the effect is lost in Garheimman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who <em>are</em> you?&rdquo; Gudrun whispered.</p>
<p>The vampire bowed slightly. &ldquo;As I said, you may call me Tzen Ma.
Formerly Bokchang Tzen Urpatnati Halprilar, lord and eldest of the Pale
Remainder, now an initiate of the Sixth Order of the Clear Light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was my understanding that the Clear Light only had five orders,&rdquo;
Prince Evan said in the silence that followed.</p>
<p>The vampire raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;Your lady has taught you well. In
truth, there are only five <em>breathing</em> orders.&rdquo; He smiled indulgently.
&ldquo;When I first planned the rebellion, I hoped that the breathers would
be able to run it themselves, but it quickly became clear that they
would need some guidance.&rdquo; He shrugged expressively. &ldquo;Five is so much
more elegant a number than six, but sometimes elegance must be
sacrificed for practicality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lying, weeping, frozen-souled monster!&rdquo; Gudrun snarled. &ldquo;How
dare you? How <em>dare</em> you say such things? You&mdash;you died the true death
at Bollesund, I <em>know</em> you did!&rdquo; Piqaluujaq had risen silently to his
feet behind her. Tzen Ma shook his head at the questioning look on the
Anuat shaman&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, I must disappoint you,&rdquo; the vampire corrected her gently. &ldquo;If
my former fellows had suspected that I was still quick, they would have
instantly known who was behind the rebellion. As it was, I had to act
far more quickly than I wanted to on several occasions to keep my
continued existence a secret. Your predecessors allowed themselves to be
captured far too often for my comfort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you,&rdquo; Gudrun said flatly through a clenched jaw.
&ldquo;Our spells would have sniffed you out in a heartbeat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vampire&rsquo;s smile finally slipped. &ldquo;This grows tedious,&rdquo; he sighed.
&ldquo;Who do you think taught you those spells? Mm? And who do you think
sent you that vial of Silk&rsquo;s blood, so that he would have to do your
bidding? Or did you truly think that you were bargaining with a
dragon?&rdquo; Sarcasm dripped like honey from the vampire&rsquo;s melodious
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; the prince interrupted, feeling foolish and vulnerable at
the sound of his own voice, &ldquo;But may I ask why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vampire spread his hands. &ldquo;They were disgusting,&rdquo; he said simply.
&ldquo;All they did was eat and eat, night after night. Children, the
elderly, hermits living deep in the Herd of Trees&mdash;they spared no-one.
They had no control at all.&rdquo; He sighed. &ldquo;I tried to teach them, but
they were all too set in their ways, even the younger ones. They simply
weren&rsquo;t interested in learning anything new any longer.&rdquo; His polite
smile returned. &ldquo;As I said, quite disgusting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disgusting, or boring?&rdquo; the prince asked shrewdly.</p>
<p>Tzen Ma&rsquo;s smile widened. &ldquo;Truly, your lady has taught you very well,&rdquo;
he said approvingly.</p>
<p>Suddenly the pieces of the puzzle fell together in the prince&rsquo;s mind,
like a glass shattering in reverse. &ldquo;And now you want to destroy the
Wrestler,&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;Is that what this is all about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tzen Ma bowed deeply. &ldquo;Wisdom in youth is as full of promise as sweet
fruit from a sapling,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yes, I am going to destroy this
creature they call king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something clattered behind the prince. &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Piqaluujaq apologized.
He had quietly filled the kettle while Tzen Ma spoke, and had set it on
the coals to boil.</p>
<p>When he spoke again, Tzen Ma&rsquo;s tone was no longer light. &ldquo;I flew back
to Ax Medicine while you slept,&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;Several buildings are
still burning, but the damage is less than it might have been. Her Grace
the Balance and most of the Garheimmen are being held prisoner.
Mingullaq sounded quite upset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the other cloudherds?&rdquo; Tahura asked.</p>
<p>Tzen Ma shook his head. &ldquo;I saw no sign of them, or of their clouds.&rdquo;
He looked at Gudrun. &ldquo;But the Wrestler is still there, and still
quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is no longer my first concern,&rdquo; Gudrun said. Her usual icy calm
had returned.</p>
<p>Tzen Ma&rsquo;s eyebrow went up again. &ldquo;Truly?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Do you not wish
to finish what you have started? Do you not wish to free the Anuat from
the grim future that awaits them if this abomination is allowed to
terrorize them, as once the people of Garheim were terrorized? Oh yes,&rdquo;
he added, as a startled look flashed across Gudrun&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;I wrote
that. I wrote the entire letter. Do you believe me now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether she believes you or not,&rdquo; the prince said, &ldquo;I think Tahura
and I at least must return to Ax Medicine. I am sworn to the Balance&rsquo;s
service, which means I cannot take sides in this. And Tahura is just
a&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that will not immediately be possible,&rdquo; Tzen Ma
interrupted apologetically. &ldquo;Despite his condition, the Wrestler has a
very sensitive nose. I believe he sniffed me out when I was there. Some
terns were circling overhead when I returned. They must certainly have
seen your cloud. I fear that the Wrestler and his warriors will not be
long in coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we will wait for them here,&rdquo; the prince said diplomatically.</p>
<p>Tzen Ma smiled. &ldquo;Again, I&rsquo;m afraid that will not be possible,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Given what has happened, I do not think the Anuat will make
distinctions between you and the Garheimmen, and I simply cannot allow
so promising a sapling to be cut down before it truly has a chance to
flower. Besides,&rdquo; he added, nodding at Piqaluujaq as the Anuat touched
the prince&rsquo;s elbow with a gentle hand and offered him a cup of tea,
&ldquo;If you stay, the young lady probably will as well, and without her
cloud, the next few days will be very awkward indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it you plan to do?&rdquo; Gudrun asked suspiciously, as Piqaluujaq
handed a second cup to Tahura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I plan to destroy the Wrestler,&rdquo; Tzen Ma said to her. &ldquo;You may call
me an abomination, but he should truly have never existed. And he is
growing stronger, every day. If we do not move against him now, it may
soon be too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gudrun snorted. &ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s a fine thing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;One monster
calling another ugly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tzen Ma smiled politely. &ldquo;There are as many kinds of ugliness as there
are of light,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Gudrun shook her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; Tzen Ma sighed. &ldquo;Well, I am not asking you to trust me. I am
only asking you to co-operate with me. It is a very different thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince realized he was holding his breath. A heartbeat went by, then
another, and then Gudrun nodded grudgingly. Tzen Ma&rsquo;s smile widened as
Piqaluujaq silently handed her a cup of tea.</p>
<p>She had not yet raised it to her lips when they heard a quick patter of
footsteps outside. Arne bounded through the tent flap in wolf form,
shifting into his human shape even as he moved. &ldquo;Anuat!&rdquo; he gasped as
soon as he had a throat and lips to speak with. &ldquo;On the beach. In
kayaks. They were flying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Tahura and the prince said together, as Arne began to pull on
his clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this part of your plan as well?&rdquo; Gudrun asked. There was a note of
triumph in her voice.</p>
<p>Tzen Ma shook his head. &ldquo;He moves quickly,&rdquo; the vampire admitted.
&ldquo;But&mdash;truly, they were flying?&rdquo; he asked Arne.</p>
<p>The werewolf nodded, hopping in place as he pulled on first his right
boot, then his left. &ldquo;They came down near your boat,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all covered in feathers instead of sealskin.&rdquo; He
straightened up. &ldquo;Even the paddles are feathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vampire hissed like a snake. His eyes shone red like polished
rubies. &ldquo;Now do you understand?&rdquo; he said to Gudrun. &ldquo;No clean magic
is that powerful. He is robbing the dead for strength. He is eating dark
holes in all our futures, and if we do not stop him, <em>something</em> will
find them and come crawling through into the world one day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed a sharp-nailed finger at Piqaluujaq and gave an order in
Anuat. The shaman nodded and began to gather together his things. The
vampire&rsquo;s finger swung to Tahura. &ldquo;Get your cloud,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are
going north. The rest of you, bring whatever blankets and clothing you
can find. Quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tahura mind-spoke to Pearl as Prince Evan picked up a blanket and handed
it to her, then picked up another one and handed it to Arne. &ldquo;Do you
want your table?&rdquo; he asked Tzen Ma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, I&rsquo;ll bring it,&rdquo; the vampire said. &ldquo;It is heavier than it
looks. Do you have everything? Good, then go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stumbled out through the tent flap into the grayness of the
pre-dawn overcast. The cloud was just touching down in front of them
when Arne yelled, &ldquo;Here they come!&rdquo; The prince caught a quick glimpse
of half a dozen figures in mottled parkas running toward them from the
beach. Two of them dropped to their knees, raised their bows, and let
arrows fly.</p>
<p>Piqaluujaq raised his drum and slapped its skin hard. The <em>boom</em> was
louder than it had any right to be. The arrows faltered and fell into
the tundra a few yards short of their targets, but the bowmen were
already taking aim again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quickly!&rdquo; Tzen Ma ordered. The other Anuat were still running at
them, spears in their hands. Tahura scrambled up onto the cloud, then
turned and gave Gudrun her hand as Arne boosted her with his shoulder.
<em>Boom!</em> and another pair of arrows fell wide. Prince Evan pulled himself
up Pearl&rsquo;s flank. Piqaluujaq tossed his drum up beside the prince, and
then clawed his way up after it.</p>
<p>Tzen Ma mounted the cloud in a single graceful leap, his lacquered table
held high over his head like a flag. &ldquo;Up! Up!&rdquo; he urged Tahura. The
cloud was already rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; Tahura screamed. The prince caught just a glimpse of a
harpoon falling down through the air toward Arne like a hawk stooping on
a mouse, and then Tzen Ma pushed the werewolf aside and took the blow
full in his chest. The vampire staggered with the impact, but stayed on
his feet. The carved wooden shaft sparkled slightly, then dimmed. The
vampire grabbed it with both hands, hissed, and tried to push it
through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me,&rdquo; he ordered Prince Evan, turning so that the harpoon&rsquo;s
barbed head was facing the prince. The prince reached hesitantly for the
shaft. &ldquo;Go on, it won&rsquo;t bite,&rdquo; the vampire gasped. He seemed to be
having trouble getting enough air to speak. &ldquo;I might, but it won&rsquo;t.
Hold it firmly. Yes, like that. Now <em>pull</em>.&rdquo; The harpoon stuck for an
instant, then slid free. Tzen Ma dropped to his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up there!&rdquo; Gudrun suddenly said, pointing above and ahead of them.
The prince stared at the vampire for another instant, as if his eyes
were snagged on a fishing line, then pulled his gaze up to follow
Gudrun&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>Two long, thin shapes, like stretched-out seeds, floated in the air. It
took him a moment to recognize them as the feathered kayaks Arne had
spoken of. Instead of dark sealskin, they seemed to be covered in the
skins of white-feathered seabirds. He couldn&rsquo;t see who was paddling,
but each double-bladed paddle seemed to be made of just two giant
feathers.</p>
<p>Tzen Ma made a wheezing sound, which turned after an instant into
choking laughter. &ldquo;Lucky&mdash;&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; the prince asked.</p>
<p>The vampire nodded. &ldquo;Lucky for them they didn&rsquo;t scratch my table,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;That would have made me very angry indeed.&rdquo; He reached up to
take the hand the prince offered, then stood and looked up at the
kayaks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost light,&rdquo; the prince said quietly. &ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tzen Ma didn&rsquo;t seem to hear. He spoke in Anuat to Piqaluujaq, then
turned to Tahura. &ldquo;Go north,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;As quickly as you can.
Piqaluujaq knows the way. I will join you there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tahura nodded, but Gudrun asked sharply, &ldquo;Why? What are you planning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tzen Ma smiled a crooked, almost human smile. &ldquo;Planning? We are far
beyond any plans I have made. I just wish to introduce your tame
shapechanger to a friend of mine. Now, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me&hellip;&rdquo; He took
the edges of his cloak in his hands and raised his arms so that the
colorless cloth hung down on either side of his body like the feathers
of an eagle&rsquo;s wings. Suddenly he was airborne, his legs straight behind
him and his head pulled back as he soared toward the flying kayaks.</p>
<p>Another harpoon fell toward him as he flew, twisting magically toward
him in mid-air but somehow still missing him. Tzen Ma let go of the
edges of his cloak to grab hold of the prow of the lead kayak. The last
the prince saw of him as Pearl rose into the underside of the overcast,
the vampire was pulling himself up onto the top of the kayak as its
paddler raised another harpoon from the grips that held it flush at his
side.</p>
<ul>

<ul>

</ul>
<p>The gray overcast rolled beneath them like a field of sooty snow. For
the first hour or so, the prince kept looking anxiously backward, but
there was no sign of the strange flying kayaks. Piqaluujaq pointed
Tahura at a gap between two of the far-off mountains, then lay flat at
the cloud&rsquo;s edge with his head on folded hands to watch the world go
by. Arne and Gudrun sat side by side, speaking to each other in quiet,
intense voices.</p>
<p>The overcast eventually developed gaps, then turned into scattered,
wispy puffs. Prince Evan and Tahura looked down at the living tundra
below them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it would all be empty,&rdquo; Tahura said, as they passed over a
small herd of musk ox. The cows and bulls kept the calves on the inside
of the herd, so that they could form a protective circle quickly if they
had to. &ldquo;I never imagined&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince nodded. &ldquo;Me either. Her Grace&rsquo;s books just talk about how
hard this land is in winter, or what it&rsquo;s like to be caught in the ice.
I guess the people who wrote them never came here in summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; Tahura echoed.</p>
<p>They flew on through the morning, and into the early afternoon. Finally
Piqaluujaq pulled himself to his feet and came over to sit with Tahura
and the prince. &ldquo;When stones all together,&rdquo; he told them, pointing
ahead of them. The prince squinted, but couldn&rsquo;t see anything.</p>
<p>Tahura shook her head as well after a moment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I don&rsquo;t
understand,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Piqaluujaq pointed again. &ldquo;All stones when together,&rdquo; he repeated. He
turned one hand palm-up and stiffened his fingers, so that they pointed
up like a ring of candles.</p>
<p>The prince squinted ahead again, but Tahura saw it first. &ldquo;There!&rdquo; she
said, putting her hand on the prince&rsquo;s shoulder and pointing. &ldquo;See?
There&rsquo;s a ring of stones.&rdquo; Sure enough, twenty or so boulders, each as
big as a grown ox, had been rolled, pushed, or carried to create a
circle thirty or forty feet across. The ring lay at the top of a rise
too shallow to be called a hill. The blue and white flowers that dotted
the tundra grew thickly inside it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want us to land?&rdquo; Tahura asked. Piqaluujaq nodded, making a
motion with his hand like an autumn leaf settling to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; Gudrun asked as the cloud began to lose altitude.</p>
<p>The prince pointed to the ring of stones. &ldquo;Piqaluujaq wants us to set
down there, Your Honor&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>Gudrun frowned. &ldquo;I thought we were going to the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince shrugged helplessly. &ldquo;I am just a passenger on this journey,
Your Honor. We will be out in the open, with clear skies above us. If
this is a trap, we should have plenty of warning before it is sprung.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gudrun&rsquo;s frown stayed on her face, but she kept quiet after that. Arne
was quiet as well. Once or twice the prince had caught the Garheimman
looking at him, but Arne had looked away quickly, unwilling to meet the
prince&rsquo;s eyes. Even yesterday, the prince realized, he would have
enjoyed that. Now, it just seemed pointless.</p>
<p>On an impulse he sat down beside the werewolf. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty empty,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Arne nodded. &ldquo;Mm hm. I&rsquo;ve been a lot of places in Garheim, but
everywhere I went, there was something that people had made&mdash;a trail,
part of an old farm wall, sometimes just a stand of apple trees.&rdquo; He
glanced at the prince. &ldquo;Except for those stones, it&rsquo;d be easy to
believe that we&rsquo;re the first people to ever come this way. It
feels&hellip;&rdquo; He shrugged instead of finishing his sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you mean,&rdquo; the prince said softly. There was a soft bump
as the cloud touched down. The prince got to his feet. &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what our guide is up to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the next hour or so, all Piqaluujaq seemed to be up to was sitting.
He picked out a stone that had an indentation at just the right height
and sat on it as if it were a chair in an inn. Arne and Tahura spent the
time changing the dressing on Gudrun&rsquo;s arm, while the prince wandered
in a slow lap around the stones. As far as he could tell, they were just
lumps of rock, no different from any of the others that lay scattered on
the tundra. And up close, it was hard to tell that the flowers grew more
thickly inside the ring than outside it.</p>
<p>Prince Evan had just completed his circuit of the stones, and Tahura was
rolling up Gudrun&rsquo;s old bandage, when Arne suddenly growled. He raised
his head slightly and twitched his nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Gudrun asked sharply. Arne didn&rsquo;t seem to hear her.
Piqaluujaq had risen to his feet. To the prince&rsquo;s astonishment, the
Anuat threw his arms wide and began to sing a high-pitched, yelping
song. His eyes were closed, and there was a look of solemn joy on his
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arne, what is it?&rdquo; Gudrun demanded.</p>
<p>The younger Garheimman shook his head. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; he whispered.
His eyes were as round as coins, and he kept sniffing at the wind that
was blowing into his face. To the prince&rsquo;s astonishment, Arne whimpered
and began to shift into wolf form, then changed his mind and became
fully human again.</p>
<p>Gudrun clumsily drew her knife from the sheath at her belt. &ldquo;What is
happening to him?&rdquo; she yelled at Piqaluujaq. The shaman kept singing,
Gudrun took a step toward him. &ldquo;What are you doing to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tahura clutched the prince&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Evan&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it,&rdquo; the prince said. A pale white shape was trotting across
the tundra toward them on four legs. Its blunt muzzle was streaked with
gray, as was its bushy tail. It was&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wolf,&rdquo; the prince breathed. &ldquo;Tahura, it&rsquo;s a <em>wolf</em>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; Gudrun said flatly. &ldquo;The wolves died in the
plague like all the others dogs. It must be a ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince shook his head. &ldquo;I never heard of a ghost that you could
smell,&rdquo; he said, gesturing at Arne.</p>
<p>They stood there, the southerners silent, Piqaluujaq singing, as the
wolf closed the last hundred yards. It stopped a few feet away from them
and sat on her haunches, her red tongue lolling out. The prince could
hear it panting.</p>
<p>Piqaluujaq ended his song and opened his eyes. The wolf seemed to grin.
&ldquo;Very nice,&rdquo; she said in Garheimman. &ldquo;But it sounds better in the
original.&rdquo; She threw back her head and howled a long, mournful howl.</p>
<p>Arne dropped to his knees. &ldquo;My lady,&rdquo; he breathed. There were tears on
his cheeks.</p>
<p>The wolf grinned her sharp-toothed grin at him. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;What are you waiting for?&rdquo; Arne hesitated, then began tearing off his
clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who <em>are</em> you?&rdquo; Gudrun asked for the second time in as many days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a friend of a friend of yours,&rdquo; the wolf replied. &ldquo;Say, you
wouldn&rsquo;t have any sausages, would you? The kind with pepper and garlic
in them? No?&rdquo; She whined a sigh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity. I haven&rsquo;t had a good
sausage in years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you&mdash;are you real?&rdquo; Tahura asked uncertainly.</p>
<p>The wolf&rsquo;s grin grew wider. &ldquo;Ask your friend,&rdquo; she said. Tahura
glanced over her shoulder. Arne was standing there in wolf form, one
forepaw raised uncertainly as if he were afraid to take the first step.</p>
<p>The newcomer crouched down playfully and barked, then barked again. Arne
whined. The newcomer sat back on her haunches. &ldquo;Oh come on,&rdquo; she said,
exasperated. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t bite. Not hard, anyway.&rdquo; Arne hesitated a
heartbeat longer, then bounded over to her.</p>
<p>The two wolves wrestled with each other playfully, biting one another&rsquo;s
ears and rising up onto their hind legs. Piqaluujaq looked on as proudly
as a new father. Prince Evan felt a lump in his throat. He knew he was
seeing something that his grandfather&rsquo;s father had taken for granted,
and that his father had never seen&mdash;that he had never thought to see.</p>
<p>Finally Arne and the wolf finished making their introductions. Arne
stretched out on the tundra, panting, with the wolf on her haunches
beside him. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been quite a while.&rdquo; She
switched to Anuat and barked something at Piqaluujaq. The shaman shook
his head. The wolf&rsquo;s ears went flat as he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a quick old monster, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; she said, speaking in
Garheimman once again. &ldquo;I hope Tzen Ma found somewhere dark in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince felt like his head was whirling. &ldquo;You know him?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The wolf blinked and yawned. Her jaws stretched wider than the prince
would have imagined possible. When they snapped shut, they made a moist
<em>clack</em>. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He and I are partners, in a strange
way. And Piqaluujaq too, of course,&rdquo; she added as an afterthought.
&ldquo;What happened to your arm? I could smell the blood a mile away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gudrun glanced down at the fresh bandages on her wound. &ldquo;Some of the
Wrestler&rsquo;s warriors,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not as bad as it looks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things rarely are,&rdquo; the wolf agreed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re usually worse.&rdquo; She
yipped a laugh.</p>
<p>The prince stepped forward. &ldquo;Allow me to introduce myself,&rdquo; he said
formally. &ldquo;I am Evan Prince Ensworth, in the service of Her Grace the
Balance Petcharatiriv. This is&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, yes,&rdquo; the wolf interrupted. &ldquo;Gudrun Astridsdottir and
Tahura the cloudherd.&rdquo; This time her whine was a sigh. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m
Laughs-Like-A-Fish, except these days most people call me Last Laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there more of you?&rdquo; Tahura asked. &ldquo;I mean, more wolves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Last Laugh growled softly. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied flatly. Arne&rsquo;s ears had
pricked up at the question. He raised his head at her answer and looked
at her with his clear blue eyes. Last Laugh licked one of his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m the last,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Some of us thought we could hide,
out in the islands, but the plague found us there eventually.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So how did you--?&rdquo; the prince began.</p>
<p>Last Laugh&rsquo;s eyes were golden. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I have it
too. The shaman&rsquo;s magic, and Tzen Ma&rsquo;s, have held it off, but sooner
or later it will get me.&rdquo; She yipped again. &ldquo;Probably sooner, now that
I&rsquo;m back among people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that, Arne scrambled to his feet with a bark. &ldquo;Oh, be quiet,&rdquo; Last
Laugh said crossly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of being the only one who thinks the
moon is worth singing about. Piqaluujaq does his best, but he&rsquo;s no good
with the high notes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Last Laugh stood up and spoke in Anuat for a moment, then trotted over
to the side of the cloud. Piqaluujaq picked her up with a grunt and
pushed her up onto the cloud&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s damp,&rdquo; she said, wrinkling her nose. &ldquo;Oh well. Come on, we had
best get going. If Tzen Ma&rsquo;s still alive, or whatever he calls it,
he&rsquo;ll track us quickly enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tahura looked at the prince helplessly. The prince spread his hands in
an I-don&rsquo;t-know-either gesture. &ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo; Tahura asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Into the mountains,&rdquo; Last Laugh barked. She had walked from one end
of the cloud to the other, and was back at the edge nearest the humans,
looking down. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d be better off on two legs,&rdquo; she told Arne, who
was standing mutely beside Tahura. She grinned. &ldquo;Never thought I&rsquo;d
hear myself say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in the mountains?&rdquo; Gudrun asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Wrestler&rsquo;s birthplace, and his grave,&rdquo; Last Laugh replied.
&ldquo;Piqaluujaq and I have been looking for it for years. Tzen Ma promised
to bring us a half-wolf if we could find it for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tahura started down at Arne, whose ears had gone flat, and then looked
back up at Last Laugh. &ldquo;What do you want with Arne?&rdquo; Her eyes widened
as a horrible thought crossed her mind. &ldquo;Are you&mdash;are you going to try
to have puppies with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time, the wolf looked serious, and sad. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Whatever shape he might be, he&rsquo;s still human. And even if we could,
they wouldn&rsquo;t last long. Not if they were really wolves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Last Laugh sighed with a whine. &ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s just a few wolf things I
want someone to remember. Some songs, and some stories. Piqaluujaq knows
them, but as I said, he&rsquo;s no good with the high notes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She grinned. &ldquo;Now come on. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to ride one of these
things. Do you bite it to get it to go faster?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>*</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And so they journeyed on, three humans, one wolf, and one who was
something in between. The tundra rose slowly at first, then more
quickly. Its gentle swells turned choppy, like waves breaking on a
shore, until finally they were in the Bentfathers.</p>
<p>The mountains were no less alive than the rest of the world, but they
seemed like the casualties of a long-forgotten battle to Tahura. Steep
cliffs and sharp-edged valleys showed where the ice had cut and cut
again. Not even the hardy grasses and long-lived moss of the tundra
could survive here. A few blue and white flowers, an occasional finger
of green, and here and there a bird floating suspended between the earth
and the sky were the only signs that there was still life left in the
world.</p>
<p>The daylight began to ebb away. Whenever she was asked how much further
it was, Last Laugh just barked, &ldquo;Further.&rdquo; She sat beside Arne the
whole time, talking in soft barks and growls. Piqaluujaq sat a little
away from them, nodding occasionally, or adding something in his jumbled
Garheimman.</p>
<p>Finally the wolf padded forward to sit beside Tahura and the prince.
&ldquo;Go left up ahead, where the pass splits,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There is a
path. Follow it up the side of the mountain, and beach us there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the Wrestler&rsquo;s grave?&rdquo; the prince asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t, then it will probably be ours,&rdquo; the wolf replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is everything a joke to you?&rdquo; Gudrun asked. It was the first time she
had spoken since they had left the circle of stones.</p>
<p>The wolf grinned at her. &ldquo;They used to say that wolves were the
laughter of the north,&rdquo; she told the Garheimman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just trying to
keep that tradition alive a little longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tahura followed the wolf&rsquo;s directions. Sure enough, a thin line
appeared on the ground beneath them. To call it a path would have been
like calling a trickle of water poured from a half-empty cup a river. It
was never wider than two boots set beside one another, and in places it
disappeared entirely.</p>
<p>But it did climb the mountain. Tahura kept Pearl above it, watching for
signs of digging or a funeral pyre, until suddenly the trail stopped.
&ldquo;Down there?&rdquo; she asked Last Laugh.</p>
<p>The wolf growled. Tahura mind-spoke to Pearl, then gave the order again.
After a few heartbeats she turned to Last Laugh with a helpless look on
her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; Tahura said. &ldquo;Pearl won&rsquo;t go down there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wolf snorted. &ldquo;Sensible creature. Beach us as close as you can.
We&rsquo;ll walk the rest of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took all the threats and flattery Tahura knew to get Pearl to land on
the mountainside at all. They found themselves a few hundred yards away
from the path&rsquo;s abrupt end. The sun didn&rsquo;t seem to want to leave them,
although the light was taking on the silvery sheen of evening. Last
Laugh waited until they had gathered their things together, then trotted
up the path. &ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; Tahura ordered Pearl. She walked a few paces
along the path herself, then turned and repeated the order. She knew it
was pointless. She could feel the cloud edging away even as she spoke.</p>
<p>Tahura and the prince puffed up the path behind Gudrun, who was in turn
behind Piqaluujaq and Arne. &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; the prince gasped to Tahura.
&ldquo;You should, be used, to this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So should you,&rdquo; Tahura replied. &ldquo;All that, talking, you do.&rdquo; The
prince smiled and tried to pick up his pace.</p>
<p>The others waited for them at the top of the path. Up close, the prince
could see that it led into a narrow crack in the mountain&rsquo;s shoulder.
Gudrun was scowling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this,&rdquo; she muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do humans always say such obvious things?&rdquo; the wolf asked no-one
in particular. &ldquo;Anyone with a decent nose could smell that you don&rsquo;t
like this.&rdquo; To Prince Evan, the wolf sounded just as tense as Gudrun.
And as himself, he admitted. There was something wrong about this place,
like a sound that couldn&rsquo;t quite be heard, or the feeling that you were
doing something that you knew was wrong, and that someone was very
disappointed.</p>
<p>Piqaluujaq produced a thick miner&rsquo;s candle from his bag. As an
afterthought, he pulled out his tea kettle as well. He handed it to
Tahura and pointed mutely at a patch of snow that lay in a shadowed
crevice near the cave entrance. Some dry twigs and leaves came out of a
leather bag, and two half-burned pieces of charcoal.</p>
<p>As Piqaluujaq set to work, Last Laugh said, &ldquo;You know, the very first
time I saw Garheimmen was a tea race. Five soldiers in the middle of
nowhere, running across a field and then trying to get a fire started
and a pot of tea made.&rdquo; She yipped. &ldquo;It was the silliest thing I&rsquo;d
ever seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A small rock came tumbling out of nowhere and bounced off the
mountainside next to her. Last Laugh jumped into the air as if she had
been bitten, then whirled with the others to look up. For a moment the
prince couldn&rsquo;t see anything except rock and ice, but then three
figures in hooded parkas rose to their feet on the ridge above them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run!&rdquo; Last Laugh howled, launching herself up at their ambushers.
Arne and Gudrun drew their swords and followed her.</p>
<p>A foot crunched on gravel behind the prince, and strong arms closed
around him. He shouted and tried to twist free, but his attacker&rsquo;s grip
was as strong as iron. Tahura screamed beside him, caught in the grip of
another hooded form.</p>
<p>Gudrun glanced back over her shoulder at their cries and cursed. She
half-ran, half-stumbled back down the mountainside and lunged at the
figure holding Prince Evan. Her sword slid through its parka and into
its ribs. Gudrun had time for an instant of shock before the figure&rsquo;s
fur-clad arm knocked her away. Still holding the prince with one arm, it
fumbled for the sword with the other, then drew it out and threw it
end-over-end down the mountain.</p>
<p>The battle was over a few heartbeats later. Arne was carried struggling
down the mountain as casually as a piglet in a farmer&rsquo;s arms. Only Last
Laugh escaped. The wolf had ducked around one of the attackers and
scrambled up to higher ground. From where he sat facing the cave
entrance, Prince Evan could see her pacing back and forth, her ears
pricked up. Piqaluujaq sat beside him, his eyes downcast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were fools to come here,&rdquo; a hoarse voice whispered in Garheimman.
The prince looked up and nearly screamed. Beside him, he heard Tahura&rsquo;s
breath catch in her throat as the figure standing in front of them
pulled back its hood.</p>
<p>It had once been a man, but now the mummified flesh lay like hard wax
over its skull. Its eyes were closed, and its eyelids seemed somehow
sunken, like the cheeks of a toothless old man. Its hair had gone wiry
and wispy, so that it looked more like a cast-off doll than a person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrestler,&rdquo; Gudrun breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the creature in front of them replied, its soft voice somehow
carrying despite the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he betrayed us to you after all,&rdquo; Gudrun said. She snorted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the Wrestler agreed, &ldquo;But not for that. You&rsquo;re a fool for
thinking you could wrestle with the Anuat and win.&rdquo; His gaze shifted to
Piqaluujaq. &ldquo;And <em>you</em> are a bigger fool for coming back here.&rdquo; He
added something ugly in Anuat.</p>
<p>Piqaluujaq didn&rsquo;t look up. &ldquo;Oh, come now,&rdquo; the Wrestler said,
switching back to Garheimman. &ldquo;Have you no greeting for your
once-upon-a-time brothers?&rdquo; He gestured at the parka&rsquo;d figure nearest
him.</p>
<p>The prince knew what he was going to see as soon as the figure removed
one mitt, but like a rabbit watching a snake crawl closer, he could not
take his eyes away. The second mitt came off, and then the bony,
waxy-fleshed hands reached up and pulled the parka hood back. Its face
was as dead as the Wrestler&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>One by one the others pulled their hoods back. One or two had deep
gashes across their necks, as though their throats had been cut. Here
and there teeth showed past lips that had pulled back as they dried out.
All of them had the same waxy, mummified flesh as the Wrestler.</p>
<p>A whine came from Arne&rsquo;s throat as if he were in wolf form. Gudrun went
pale. &ldquo;Monster,&rdquo; she said, and then she yelled it again. &ldquo;Monster!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flinched as the Wrestler stepped closer to her. &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; it
whispered. &ldquo;Monster, indeed. But remember, your kind made me. When you
spit at me, you spit at a mirror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It snapped an order in Anuat. Its undead warriors pulled Gudrun, Arne,
the prince, Tahura, and Piqaluujaq to their feet, then pushed them
roughly toward the cave entrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you taking us?&rdquo; the prince asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My birthplace,&rdquo; the Wrestler replied. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that what you came to
see?&rdquo; His jaw clacked again. &ldquo;My birthplace, and your grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The walls of the passage that led them into the mountain&rsquo;s heart looked
as though they had been melted long ago. The uneven floor beneath the
prince&rsquo;s feet made him stumble. His eyes flickered this way and that,
hoping for a side passage or a niche that he could slip into, but the
walls just went on and on. They walked in single file, with the Wrestler
in the lead. The only light came from the miner&rsquo;s candle that
Piqaluujaq carried. For an instant, the prince wondered what would
happen to the Anuat shaman&rsquo;s tea kettle, which they had left sitting on
the small fire behind them. Then they came around a corner, and the
passage widened, and the stray thought was drowned in awe.</p>
<p>The half-dome above them was as smooth as a pearl. Highlights cast by
the candle gleamed and sparkled like stars. The Wrestler strode into the
center of the circular floor and raised his arms. Gray light rose up
from the floor like fog rising from a field at dawn. There, beside the
Wrestler, lay a dark stone slab, like a piece of driftwood lurking on an
otherwise empty beach. A complex star-shaped pattern was painted in
bright colors on the floor around it. Two cedar boxes overflowing with
magical paraphernalia lay against the wall opposite the entrance.</p>
<p>Piqaluujaq was the first to speak. &ldquo;Monster,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now is a
sacred time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Wrestler glanced at him. &ldquo;Oh, good, you can speak.&rdquo; His jaw
clacked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity you can&rsquo;t make any sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ghosts of our ancestors will drag you down and feed you to the
Great Whale,&rdquo; Piqaluujaq said clearly. &ldquo;You will never rest, not now
or in the spirit world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the Wrestler froze. Then, with one long stride, he was in
front of the shaman. His bony hand went <em>crack!</em> against Piqaluujaq&rsquo;s
face. The shaman staggered, but stayed on his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For that, I will use you first,&rdquo; the Wrestler hissed. He snarled an
order in Anuat.</p>
<p>The shaman fought like a lynx, but the undead were too strong. They
dragged him over to the stone slab and forced him onto it. His wrists
and ankles were tied with leather thongs. Strong arms pushed the other
breathing denizens of the chamber to one side. Tahura was crying. Prince
Evan put his arm around her shoulder awkwardly and hugged her tight.
Neither took their eyes off the scene unfolding before them.</p>
<p>The Wrestler pulled off the jacket and pants of its parka. Clothed only
in woollen longjohns, it was more horrible than the prince had imagined.
Gray bone showed through on its arms and sides where patches of flesh
had fallen away completely. Thongs had been strung through one knee to
hold its leg together.</p>
<p>As it moved around the pattern, touching up the paint here and there
with a brush taken from one of the cedar chests, the prince felt an
elbow dig into his ribs. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to rush him,&rdquo; Arne muttered.
&ldquo;The others don&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince knew that Arne meant the other undead, but what he muttered
back was, &ldquo;Tahura matters.&rdquo; But then he looked sideways into the
Garheimman&rsquo;s clear blue eyes and nodded slightly. He wondered if
Balance Petcharatiriv would be disappointed in him for taking sides, or
if his father would ever find out what had happened to his eldest son.</p>
<p>And then the ritual began. The undead Anuat stood in a circle, just
outside the pattern, with the Wrestler at their head. It raised its arms
and began a slow chant that sounded to the prince like it had never been
intended for a human throats. A cold wind blew from nowhere, carrying
with it a stench like all the rot the world had ever made.</p>
<p>The chant grew louder. Other voices seemed to join in. The Wrestler
raised a knife in both hands. The prince suddenly knew that something
was behind him, coming closer, something infinitely worse than anything
he had ever seen before, something cunning and angry and above all
<em>hungry</em>. He squeezed Tahura tight, wishing he could close his eyes&mdash;</p>
<p>The tension snapped as Piqaluujaq and the Wrestler screamed together.
The undead staggered, clawing at the solid silver arrow shaft that was
somehow stuck in its chest. Its knife clattered to the floor. A second
arrow sprouted beside the first in its chest, and then a third.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep back!&rdquo; Tzen Ma shouted from the entrance way, dropping the bow
and drawing a thin sword in the same fluid motion. The vampire skipped
past one Anuat and lopped an arm off a second with a single stroke.</p>
<p>Arne bellowed and tackled the Anuat nearest him. The undead warrior
shook him off like a bear shaking off a dog and lunged with its fellows
at Tzen Ma. The vampire ducked, rolled, twisted, and then leaped up onto
the slab and over it at the Wrestler.</p>
<p>The Wrestler spread its arms and threw itself at Tzen Ma. The vampire
ducked under its arms and slammed his sword up into the Wrestler&rsquo;s
ribs, lifting the Anuat up into the air. It landed on the slab on top of
Piqaluujaq with Tzen Ma&rsquo;s sword sticking out of it beside the two
silver arrows. In one graceful motion the vampire scooped up the
Anuat&rsquo;s knife, spun around, and drove it into the Wrestler&rsquo;s throat.</p>
<p>A dazzling flash blinded the prince, and the sharp <em>crack!</em> of thunder
that followed it deafened him. A blast of superheated air threw him
backward into the chamber wall. He dropped onto his knees, gasping for
breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tahura!&rdquo; he croaked, grasping with his hand. For a moment there was
nothing there except cold stone, but then he felt the fur of her parka.
A moment later they were hugging each other.</p>
<p>The dazzling spots in front of Prince Evan&rsquo;s eyes gradually cleared.
The Anuat were lying where they had fallen, truly lifeless at last. The
Warrior&rsquo;s body had slipped off the slab into a pile on the stone floor.
Piqaluujaq had sat up and was massaging his wrists. Tzen Ma sat beside
him, his thin sword in his lap, cleaning it with a silk rag. Arne was
helping Gudrun to her feet.</p>
<p>Last Laugh padded in on silent feet. She crossed the room to the slab,
sniffed at it with a wrinkled nose, and then jumped up beside Piqaluujaq
and began licking his face. The shaman smiled, then laughed.</p>
<p>Last Laugh barked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid your tea is pretty much spoiled,&rdquo; she
said in Garheimman.</p>
<p>Piqaluujaq shrugged, still smiling. &ldquo;Many tea somewhere,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>*</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Only three of them got on Pearl for the journey home. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the only
one she has,&rdquo; Arne said haltingly to Tahura. &ldquo;If she doesn&rsquo;t teach
me&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh,&rdquo; Tahura said softly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. It&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo; She
touched his arm gently. &ldquo;Just promise you&rsquo;ll come back and tell us
about it some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; the Garheimman said.</p>
<p>Gudrun had not been so understanding. &ldquo;You swore an oath,&rdquo; she stormed
at Arne. &ldquo;There are still vampires in the world, and you are still
needed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am needed here, too,&rdquo; Arne replied. He met Gudrun&rsquo;s gaze. &ldquo;And at
least here I&rsquo;ll know who I&rsquo;m really working for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gudrun stalked away at that. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be the end of the Clear Light,&rdquo;
the prince said to Tahura a little while later. &ldquo;Some of them won&rsquo;t
believe Tzen Ma was their master all these years, some will say it
doesn&rsquo;t matter, and none of them will ever trust secret orders again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think the war will start again?&rdquo; Tahura asked. She and the
prince were standing hand-in-hand on the beach near the spot where they
had first met Tzen Ma. The vampire&rsquo;s trim little boat was just a
thumb-sized blot near the horizon.</p>
<p>The prince smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure Nils and Mingullaq will find a way
to settle things,&rdquo; he said. His smile slipped slightly. &ldquo;I just hope
I&rsquo;ll be able to make peace with Her Grace. She&rsquo;s not going to be happy
about all of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Tahura said. &ldquo;Happy, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince&rsquo;s smile returned. &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said, tugging at her hand.
&ldquo;I bet Piqaluujaq has made tea.&rdquo;
\&lt;!======================================================================&gt;</p>
<p>Part IV</p>
<p>The dark water flowed over him like a song. The cold touched him, all
over, but he felt no chill. He felt as if he were made of liquid himself
as he did a barrel roll, then doubled back on himself, almost kissing
his hind flippers for the simple joy of doing it. He could hear the
ocean all around him, the quick flick of nearby fish and the slow,
stately stride of the lobsters on the sea floor deep beneath him.</p>
<p>And then somehow she was there, a great warm mountain with a beating
heart. Her voice whistled and croaked through him as easily as he swam
through the ocean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been a long time away,&rdquo; she told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not know,&rdquo; he replied. He would have to rise up and breath
soon, but not yet, not yet.</p>
<p>The Great Whale laughed her creak-and-whistle laugh. &ldquo;Yes you did,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;When you ran through the grass just to feel yourself
running. When you laughed because the snowflakes looked like
butterflies. When your mother brushed your hair, and you felt warm in
her arms. You knew then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her great tail swept up and down like a tree swaying in the wind.
&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he called in sudden panic as she turned and moved majestically
away. &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo; And then she was
gone.</p>
<p>He floated for a moment, suddenly feeling lost, but then he remembered
what it was like to throw a ball in the air just to catch it, or hug a
baby, or make up silly rhymes, and finally, finally, Sikuliaq let go. He
heard the happy chatter of other seals up ahead, and swam off to see if
any of them wanted to play tag.</p>
