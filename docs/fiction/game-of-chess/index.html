<h1>A Game of Chess</h1>



<p>A solarium.
A table with two comfortable chairs, an old man in each.
Snow is falling outside.
There is a chessboard between the two men;
a game is in progress.
A clock is ticking.
The camera pans in and over the men
just as one of them sighs and reaches out to move a knight.</p>
<p>Vienna at night, 1955.
A younger version of the man who just moved slips over a wall
and enters a noisy bar through the back door.</p>
<p>The solarium; the clock is ticking.
The second man sips his coffee, then puts the cup down and moves his rook.</p>
<p>Inside the bar, people are dancing, laughing, and talking in German and English.
A younger version of the second man is sitting at a table with a pretty young woman.
He turns suddenly and stares directly into the camera.</p>
<p>Solarium.
The first man moves his knight again.</p>
<p>The bar, in slow motion.
The first man pulls a gun out from under his jacket.</p>
<p>Solarium.
The second man looks at the board,
scratching his head,
while the first man pours a fresh cup of coffee and stirs in some sugar.
Finally the second man sighs and moves a pawn to cover his rook.</p>
<p>The bar, still in slow motion.
The young woman rises from her chair, mouth open to shout or scream.
She pushes the second man aside as the first man fires.</p>
<p>Solarium.
The first man sits down his coffee and nonchalantly takes his opponent&rsquo;s pawn with his knight.
He smirks slightly at his opponent…who suddenly smiles back
and moves a bishop the full length of the board.</p>
<p>The bar.
The woman is falling, shot through the heart.
The second man is already turning, tucking the gun back under his jacket.
He doesn&rsquo;t see the bartender stepping into his path, a baseball bat in his hands.</p>
