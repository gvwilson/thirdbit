<section>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>Iffy had a bad dream that night.
It was the same one she always had,
and the worst part was that it wasn&rsquo;t really a dream.</p>
<p>She was on deck.
The Antarctic sky was a blue bowl overhead,
summer cold instead of winter freezing.
Second and Third were stuffing her into
a hand-me-down ecosuit that had cost as much as one of their jelly dredging nets.
&ldquo;Just to be safe, love,&rdquo; Third said,
forcing a smile but unable to keep the fear out of her voice.
She kissed the family&rsquo;s youngest clone on the forehead
and slipped Iffy&rsquo;s favorite bedtime book inside the bulky orange suit.
&ldquo;Just in case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ship&rsquo;s horn blared another warning.
Iffy started to cry.
Her olders had pulled her out of bed just a few moments before,
and she was only half awake.</p>
<p>Third hugged her again.
&ldquo;Enough o&rsquo; that!&rdquo; Second snapped.
At the time Iffy thought the older clone was angry about something she had done.
Years later she realized Second had been angry at the sea for what was about to happen
and at herself for not being able to stop it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s boiling!&rdquo; Fourth shouted from the crow&rsquo;s nest.
&ldquo;Two hundred meters ahead and ten points off starboard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Third sealed the last flap on the ecosuit.
&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; she said in Iffy&rsquo;s ear.
&ldquo;I love you always and forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you too,&rdquo; Iffy replied tearfully.
She tried to return Third&rsquo;s hug,
but the thick insulation in the suit made it hard to bend her arms.</p>
<p>Second bent over and kissed her on the top of her head.
She smelled like engine oil and the soap she used when she shaved her head.
That was what Iffy remembered afterwards—that,
and the stench of methane rising out of the sea around them.
Hundreds of meters below,
a billion tiny bubbles were bursting out of the clathrate ice
where they had been trapped for a million years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s boiling!&rdquo; Fourth shouted again.
The deck pitched sideways as First tried desperately
to steer the <em>Rushin Doll</em> out of the mass of foam around them.
The ship&rsquo;s horn blared one last time.
Third closed the ecosuit&rsquo;s faceplate and mouthed &ldquo;I love you so much&rdquo; one final time
just as the ship staggered and dropped two meters.</p>
<p>Iffy screamed as she tumbled onto the deck.
Second and Third landed in a tangle beside beside her.
Ice-cold sea water crashed down on top of them.
Iffy screamed again as the slosh dragged her and her olders against the taffrail.
Her olders grabbed for it,
but the <em>Rushin Doll</em> dropped again
as the gas rising from the ocean floor
churned the water into a froth too thin to keep the ship afloat.
The last thing Iffy saw before the water closed over her
was Fourth falling from the crow&rsquo;s nest,
her arms and legs flailing against the perfect blue sky.</p>
<p>The ecosuit was a hundred years old,
but its seals held.
It kept her warm while the thumb-sized motors in its arms and legs
steered her clear of the after-bubbles that would have swallowed a lifeboat.</p>
<p>Her dream stopped then,
just like it always did.
She didn&rsquo;t remember the <em>Rushin Doll</em> going under.
She didn&rsquo;t remember being hauled out of the sea in a jelly dredging net hours later,
or standing on the deck of the <em>Guinevere</em> for the first time.
But she remembered how blue the sky was,
and how it had felt to be alone for the first time in her life.</p>
<p>The woman she came to call Aunt Naggie said it was a miracle Iffy had survived.
It was even more of a miracle that she wound up staying on the <em>Guinevere</em>.
Uncle Jack didn&rsquo;t like children.
Or animals.
Or foreigners,
or the governors,
or the co-ops that bought the jellyfish he and Aunt Naggie dredged out of the Weddell Sea,
or passers-by who looked at him the wrong way
or didn&rsquo;t have the decency to look at him at all.
The docksiders in Rothera never understood why he didn&rsquo;t drop her on the pier and sail away.
They wouldn&rsquo;t have believe that
his long-suffering wife had put her hands on her hips
and told him that the child was staying or she was leaving,
which was it going to be?</p>
<p>So Iffy stayed, but not the ecosuit.
Uncle Jack had two pairs that night,
eights over fives,
but the Aussie across the table had three sixes.
&ldquo;You were gonna outgrow it anyway,&rdquo;
he snapped over her tearful protests when she found out it was gone.
&ldquo;Gotta pay for your keep somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He would have gambled away the book tucked into the suit as well
if Aunt Naggie hadn&rsquo;t misplaced it until it slipped his mind.
It had belonged to Third when she was Iffy&rsquo;s age,
and to Second before that,
and came from a time when people made books out of paper
and there were still whales and tigers and giraffes.
Iffy re-read it every night no matter how tired she was from chores.
She drew the pictures from memory on her app when she was bored by school,
and took it out on those rare occasions when another child came on board to play with her
and told them all about <em>orcinus orca</em> and <em>panthera tigris</em>
and her favorite, <em>giraffa camelopardalis</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were too real!&rdquo; she said fiercely whenever anyone expressed any doubts.
&ldquo;Real as gulls and jellies!&rdquo;
As real as the handwritten comments in the book&rsquo;s margins that she spent hours deciphering.
As real as being poor and lonely
as Uncle Jack&rsquo;s business deals left them with a little less each season.</p>
<p>Iffy woke that morning to the sound of Aunt Naggie bustling about in the galley.
She lay on the narrow foam packing slab she used as a mattress for one final precious moment
before slithering out of her salvaged sleeping bag
and pulling a layer of clothes over her thermals.
The noise was her foster mother&rsquo;s way of letting her know that Uncle Jack was awake
and that she should be up on deck doing something useful
before he stumbled out into the light looking for someone to yell at.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes and opened her nature book at random.
It was ridiculous—Jeep had made fun of her for a month
when he found out—but…</p>
<p>&ldquo;Figures,&rdquo; she muttered when she opened her eyes.
The armadillo wasn&rsquo;t the worst animal in the book,
but it wasn&rsquo;t her favorite.
Still,
an armadillo day was better than a blobfish day.
She tucked the book back under her mattress,
yawned,
rubbed the stubble on her scalp,
and undogged the door of the storage locker
that had been her bedroom for the past eight years.</p>
<p>Stepping onto the deck of the <em>Guinevere</em> was like being born:
everything was suddenly bright and cold and loud and smelly.
She stopped for a moment to let her eyes adjust to the light.
To seaward lay the broken hulk of a carrier
that had driven itself aground a century before
to create a seawall for the town&rsquo;s harbor.
Dozens of ships, large and small, bobbed up and down in its lee.
Some were as old as the carrier,
patched and re-patched over the years like the <em>Guinevere</em> to stay seaworthy.
Others were newer:
broad-beamed cargo haulers flying the Aussie stars
or sleek Zillion-built clippers with bright kite sails furled around triple masts.
Gulls wheeled overhead in their endless search for scraps,
complaining to one another about that nobody threw away anything worth eating any more.</p>
<p>The town watched the harbor like a grumpy old man watching children at play.
Once upon a time,
Halley had been a research station where scientists studied the early signs of the Melt.
As the ice disappeared and life back home became desperate
they converted their labs into temporary houses.
By the time their children were grown they had stopped calling the houses &ldquo;temporary&rdquo;.
They had stopped doing research too.</p>
<p>Two thousand people now made Halley their home under the governors&rsquo; watchful eyes.
During the summer blooms they dredged jellyfish out of the sea
to render down for fuel and fertilizer.
When winter came they tended the town&rsquo;s precious greenhouses
or sailed north to Patagonia or Tasmania
to find work that would get them through the long dark.</p>
<p>Iffy shaded her eyes against the razor-edged sun.
A cluster of buildings was taking shape by the new pier on the edge of town.
Two were just bunkhouses,
but the third—the one Iffy looked at like a hungry gull looking at a scrap of naan—was a machine shop.
Shiploads of precious equipment had already been carted through its double-wide doors:
forges,
presses,
a lathe with a spindle thicker than Iffy&rsquo;s leg,
and the prize of them all,
a printer all the way from Nova Zembla.</p>
<p>It had arrived in the hold of a heavily-armed Aussie destroyer.
The whole town had turned out when the warship came into harbor,
railguns bristling and drones darting back and forth above her.
They lined the streets and cheered
as the destroyer&rsquo;s crew and a squad of Marines escorted the boxy machine through Halley&rsquo;s streets
to the town&rsquo;s quarantine shed.
Once Halley&rsquo;s core finished its months-long check for malware,
the only limit to what the printer could make
would be the plans and raw materials people could give it.</p>
<p>Iffy had seen some of those plans glowing softly on apps in Halley&rsquo;s three cafés.
She had taken surreptitious notes on her own app instead of doing homework
while mechanics and core techs argued about weights and tolerances and expansion coefficients,
then spent hours looking up words she didn&rsquo;t know and figuring out how they fit together.</p>
<p>She wanted to be part of those conversations so much it ached.
But even more than that,
she wanted to know why things she <em>hadn&rsquo;t</em> seen kept popping into her head.
Ghostly shapes flickered behind her eyes if she thought too hard about the plans:
fractal capacitors,
resonant heat sinks,
and ever-so-slightly irregular gears
whose off-center spin would automatically synchronize to minimize power coupling.
She had gone as deep into Hell as she dared to find answers,
but every trail ended in &ldquo;no results&rdquo; or a blinking scarlet &ldquo;restricted&rdquo; warning.
After a while she had stopped looking,
afraid of who or what might notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girl! Girl! Dammit, woman, where is that affin&rsquo; girl?&rdquo;
Iffy jumped as Uncle Jack bellowed from below deck.
He had been out with his biffs the night before,
which was Uncle Jack-speak for drinking more than he could handle
and gambling more than they could afford.
Aunt Naggie somehow managed to scrape enough together to keep the <em>Guinevere</em> afloat,
but it had been weeks since they&rsquo;d had fruit,
and she couldn&rsquo;t remember the last time there had been any mention of new clothes
or of replacing their frayed nets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girl!&rdquo; Uncle Jack shouted again.
&ldquo;Get your affin&rsquo; tail down here <em>now</em> or saints help me you&rsquo;ll be scrapin&rsquo; barnacles for a <em>week</em>!&rdquo;
His hand made a meaty <em>thud!</em> as he slapped the bulkhead for emphasis.</p>
<p>With one last longing look at the machine shop,
Iffy lifted the hatch beside her.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m right here, Uncle Jack,&rdquo; she said into the hold that served as galley and dining room.
&ldquo;I was just—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were just lyin&rsquo; about like some fairytale princess an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t try to tell me otherways!&rdquo;
The <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s captain glared up at her,
squinting as the bright sky assaulted his hungover eyes.
There was a bruise on his forehead that hadn&rsquo;t been there at dinner,
Iffy noticed.
That might mean a visit from the Marines later.
He&rsquo;d scowl and mutter and make excuses to them,
then bluster to Aunt Naggie after they were gone
about how the governors were going to sell them all to the Zillions
as soon as they could get a decent price.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your eggs&rsquo;ll be ready in a mo,&rdquo; Aunt Naggie cut in hurriedly
as Uncle Jack opened his mouth to unleash another bellow.
&ldquo;Do you want a bit o&rsquo; curry on them?
I think I have—no, wait, not there…&rdquo;
She rummaged among the precious little jars
that sat on the shelf beside the galley&rsquo;s two-loop stove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Affin&rsquo; right I want a bit o&rsquo; curry,&rdquo; Uncle Jack grumbled,
settling into a fold-up chair that squeaked under his weight.</p>
<p>Iffy&rsquo;s stomach grumbled as the smell of eggs, turmeric, and cumin teased her nostrils.
Tilting her frying pan,
Aunt Naggie slid two perfectly fried eggs into Uncle Jack&rsquo;s bowl.
Without so much as a grunt of thanks
her husband took the entire basket of naan from the center of table in one hand
and his plate with the other
and disappeared back into his cabin.
Iffy heard something gurgle out of a bottle as the door closed.</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie let out her breath and smiled at her foster daughter.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be hungry then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not really,&rdquo; Iffy lied,
lowering herself into the galley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course not. Here.&rdquo;
She slipped a hard-boiled egg out of the pocket of her apron and handed it to Iffy.
&ldquo;An&rsquo; here, this too.&rdquo;
A piece of perfectly-browned naan,
so fresh it was slightly sticky,
appeared out of another pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks auntie,&rdquo; Iffy said gratefully.
&ldquo;You eat already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course, first thing,&rdquo; Aunt Naggie lied in turn.
She leaned over and kissed the stubble on top of Iffy&rsquo;s head.
&ldquo;You best get that in you quick an&rsquo; start work on the winch cable.
An&rsquo; he says th&rsquo; engine&rsquo;s got a knock in it again—best have a look at that too
before it starts to bother him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the reciprocating rod,&rdquo;
Iffy said around a mouthful of naan.
&ldquo;Mister Mishra will straighten it out if I take it in before he gets busy.
It won&rsquo;t cost nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
she added hastily before her foster mother could object.
&ldquo;Not if I do a couple o&rsquo; little jobs for him.
I could head over right now if you wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If <em>I</em> wanted?&rdquo;
Aunt Naggie teased.
&ldquo;Well,
if you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; that way,
stop in at Sandhu&rsquo;s an&rsquo; see what they want for eggs—those were our last.
I&rsquo;ll tell Jack you&rsquo;re off doin&rsquo; chores once he&rsquo;s…&rdquo;
She finished her sentence with an apologetic shrug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks auntie,&rdquo; Iffy said gratefully.
She climbed back onto deck and hurried aft as quietly as she could.</p>
<p>The ship&rsquo;s toolbox rattled as she dragged it out from under the bench at the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s stern,
its contents so essential that even Uncle Jack wouldn&rsquo;t sell them.
After a furtive glance over her shoulder,
she reached up under the bench and unclipped the canvas bag that held <em>her</em> tools,
the ones she had salvaged and mended
or had been given in return for doing odd jobs for people around the harbor.
She pushed the toolbox back into place and tucked her bag under her coat.</p>
<p>It only took her a few moments to disengage the bent rod from the engine.
Slipping it into her pocket,
she closed the engine casing as gently as she could and hurried down the gangplank.
The weight of life on the <em>Guinevere</em> lifted from her shoulders
as her boots hit the pier.</p>
<p>The Antarctic summer didn&rsquo;t have days or nights,
but ships and people kept to clock time as best they could.
An old couple had woken early
to scrape tweaked barnacles off long strips of plastic they had hung from the pier months before.
Hundreds of little shells glittered with tiny particles of metal they had filtered out of the water.
Ground down and incinerated,
they would yield a few milligrams of lanthanum or indium
that could keep some old piece of tech limping along for another season.</p>
<p>One of the women straightened and raised a hand in greeting as Iffy went by.
&ldquo;Beautiful day,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You headin&rsquo; to town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am that,&rdquo; Iffy nodded,
not wanting to slow down for conversation.</p>
<p>The old woman nodded back.
&ldquo;You be careful, aye?
The <em>Taroona</em> came in yesterday.
Those pirates been bustin&rsquo; up ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Iffy said dutifully.
The old woman smiled and bent back to her strips and buckets.</p>
<p>The teens at the head of the pier arguing over how best to hang a net for mending
glanced at her as she went by but didn&rsquo;t say anything.
Iffy didn&rsquo;t expect them to.
<em>At least they don&rsquo;t cross their fingers and spit,</em> she thought.
Sailors were superstitious, and she was a sole survivor.
Nobody looked at her sidelong
the way they had when the loss of the <em>Rushin Doll</em> was still fresh,
but over the yeras Iffy had found that
friends were mostly something that happened to other people.</p>
<p><em>Mishra &amp; Co Fine Technical Work - No Job Too Small!</em>
occupied a long shed that might have been the oldest building in Halley.
The sliding door that took up half its front wall hadn&rsquo;t opened since before she was born.
Instead,
she banged on the smaller door cut into it.</p>
<p>It scraped open on her third knock.
&ldquo;Hey Jeep,&rdquo;
she said to the boy scowling at her.
&ldquo;Is your da here?&rdquo;
She held up the bent reciprocating rod by way of explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Along back,&rdquo; Jeep muttered,
jerking his thumb over his shoulder and making just enough room for Iffy to squeeze past.</p>
<p>The inside of the shed was a humid mug of long-ago fish,
freshly singed metal,
and the not-entirely-legal bricks of rendered jelly and coal dust
that Mister Mishra burned in the furnace
to keep his equipment from freezing in the winter.
Mismatched lights hung from the ceiling.
The shadows they cast made the compact machines
and shelves of carefully sorted scrap on the shop floor
look like battlebots from old war sims.
They had frightened Iffy the first time she ventured among them,
but all she saw now was what they could make—what <em>she</em> could make with them.</p>
<p>Mister Mishra was sharpening his fingers on a grinding wheel in the center of the shop.
He nodded at Iffy but didn&rsquo;t speak until the last sparks had flown off his steel nails
and the wheel spun down to a halt.
Pushing his safety goggles up onto his forehead,
he tugged the calloused fingers of his real hand through the tangles in his beard.
&ldquo;Buy, sell, or trade?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trade,&rdquo; Iffy said.
She held up the bent rod.
&ldquo;Tangled some flotsam comin&rsquo; in from our last dredge.
The engine over-spun before I could get to it.
There&rsquo;s no cracks or nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she added hastily as she handed it to him.
&ldquo;Just needs to be re-angled an&rsquo; annealed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm.&rdquo;
The wiry machinist turned the rod over,
sighted along its length,
then held it up to his good ear and tapped it with his metal fingers.
Iffy had seen him go through this ritual more times than she could count,
but still didn&rsquo;t know if the he was bluffing
or if he really could hear flaws too small for eyes to see.</p>
<p>He handed the rod back to her.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be right enough once she&rsquo;s straightened,&rdquo; he pronounced.
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;ll cost you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tension eased out of Iffy&rsquo;s shoulders.
Mister Mishra didn&rsquo;t bargain unless he&rsquo;d already decided he was going to say yes.</p>
<p>In the end,
getting the rod bent straight cost her half an hour of sorting scraps for smelting.
It wasn&rsquo;t the machine work she&rsquo;d hoped for,
but she had learned that if she timed her questions right
he would take a minute here and there to show her
how to dog the belaying plate on the laser drill
or line up a set of gatling hammers to rat-a-tat-tat a piece of sheet metal into a graceful springy curve.
She was careful never to stare at the burn scar where his left ear should have been
or at the fractal spider&rsquo;s web of articulated metal that had replaced his left forearm.
She was equally careful not to look up when Jeep slouched in
to say that lunch was ready but <em>amma</em> said he had to clean up first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hungry?&rdquo; Mister Mishra asked
as he spun the handwheel on the drill to lift the laser into its locking position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No thanks—I brought,&rdquo; Iffy said,
holding up the egg Aunt Naggie had given her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm.&rdquo; Mister Mishra ran his fingers through his beard again.
&ldquo;Not much to grow on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll do me fine,&rdquo;
Iffy said.
She nodded toward the laser drill as casually as she could.
&ldquo;You mind I try a couple of pieces while you&rsquo;re out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mister Mishra shook his head.
&ldquo;Nuh uh, <em>ji</em>.
Nobody touches my darlin&rsquo; &lsquo;less I&rsquo;m here to watch.
You break her,
I&rsquo;ll have to send up to Amundsen for parts,
and odds are they have to send all the way to Taz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aright,&rdquo; Iffy said,
feigning disappointment even though she&rsquo;d known what the answer would be.
&ldquo;How about I use th&rsquo; mechanical one instead?
Just for learnin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she added hastily.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not paid work or nothin&rsquo;.
I&rsquo;ll just drill some scrap—you can count it all in an&rsquo; out t&rsquo; make sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mister Mishra chuckled.
&ldquo;No worry about th&rsquo; scrap, girl.
An&rsquo; no worry about gettin&rsquo; paid—if you found work hereabouts that I haven&rsquo;t, more power to you.&rdquo;
He rolled his head to loosen the kinks in his neck
and waggled the digits of his artificial hand.
&ldquo;Mind your parts, aye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; Iffy agreed eagerly.
She had her scavenged safety goggles on her face and the drill bit engaged
before Mister Mishra reached the door.</p>
<p>Drilling holes wasn&rsquo;t hard—she&rsquo;d mastered that long ago.
The hard part was drilling them in the right place.
After examining and discarding half a dozen pieces of scrap,
she found one bent enough to be a challenge.</p>
<p>The first hole only took a minute.
It then took her another fifteen minutes to measure,
mark,
measure again,
swear under her breath,
find a pair of calipers in the chaos on top of Mister Mishra&rsquo;s toolbench,
chock the piece,
measure a third time,
and re-align everything juuuuust a little.
A bot could have done the whole job in a couple of seconds,
but bots had malware—at least,
the kinds of bots that people in Halley could afford.
&ldquo;You want it fast, use a bot,&rdquo; Mister Mishra always said.
&ldquo;You want it <em>right</em>, do it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly, steadily, Iffy brought the spinning drillbit down
until it just barely kissed the metal and—</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
She jumped and spun around.
Jeep was leaning against a set of shelves,
arms crossed and scowl firmly in place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;re <em>you</em> doin&rsquo; sneakin&rsquo; up on me like that?&rdquo; she demanded.
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you supposed to be havin&rsquo; lunch or somethin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His scowl deepened.
&ldquo;Finished. Does my da know what you&rsquo;re about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course he does.&rdquo;
Iffy scratched a sudden itch on her nose,
then pulled her hand back down to her side.
Mister Mishra <em>did</em> know, and she had nothing to be embarrassed about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh huh. What about your uncle?&rdquo; Jeep asked,
looking everywhere but straight at her.
&ldquo;He still bein&rsquo; trash on you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy shrugged.
&ldquo;Comes an&rsquo; goes.&rdquo;
She and Jeep used to talk when she first started coming by.
He had shown her a few of his sims
and she had shared a few stories about life at sea.
For a while she had thought he was working up the courage for something more,
but…</p>
<p>The silence stretched uncomfortably.
&ldquo;I gotta get back to this,&rdquo; she finally said,
waving a hand at the drill press idling behind her.</p>
<p>Jeep straightened up.
&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you rather be doin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; useful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This <em>is</em> useful!&rdquo; Iffy said hotly.
&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s none o&rsquo; your business what I do or don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
She turned back to the drill,
placing her foot firmly on the pedal that controlled the motor&rsquo;s speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just be careful,&rdquo; Jeep said belligerently.
&ldquo;Da&rsquo;s double worried about that new printer takin&rsquo; work away.
If anythin&rsquo; here gets bust up—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anythin&rsquo; here gets bust up your da will know it was me that did it
because it ain&rsquo;t like <em>you</em> ever put your hands to any o&rsquo; this!&rdquo;
Iffy snapped.
She cranked the drill bit up into its locked position and switched the machine off.
&ldquo;Here!&rdquo;
Three quick twists undid the chocks that held her test piece in place.
She tossed it at him harder than the distance required,
then took the calipers from the work tray on the side of the drill
and slapped them back onto the bench.
&ldquo;Gimme a sec an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll sweep up th&rsquo; shavings for you to weigh
so you can be sure I ain&rsquo;t fillin&rsquo; my pockets or nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without waiting for answer she pulled the goggles down around her neck
and grabbed the old broom that stood next to a broken sonic press like a forgotten sentry.
Jeep watched her sweep,
anger and something that might have been embarrassment written on his face.
&ldquo;You missed a bit,&rdquo; he finally said,
jerking his chin at a random patch of floor before turning and stalking away.
The door banged behind him.</p>
<p>Iffy emptied the dustpan into the trash and tossed her goggles into her toolbag.
It wasn&rsquo;t fair—Jeep could use the equipment any time he wanted,
but all he ever did was complain and look for ways not to.</p>
<p>The worst thing was,
she knew it wasn&rsquo;t Jeep&rsquo;s fault.
Like everyone else in Antarctica
he had been inducted into the Marines when he turned sixteen.
He&rsquo;d only served a few months—just long enough to be sure that the imprinting had worked—but
having someone else&rsquo;s personality temporarily painted over his own had changed him.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll come back eventually,&rdquo;
Mister Mishra said the one time Iffy broached the subject,
his tone making it clear that she shouldn&rsquo;t bring it up again.
&ldquo;It just takes some folk longer than others to find their way home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sky was the same relentless blue it had been an hour earlier when Iffy stepped outside,
the mended reciprocating rod tucked inside her coat.
She peeled her egg as she walked toward the grocery store,
trying not to get grease on the rubbery white flesh.
A couple of Aunt Naggie&rsquo;s friends smiled or waved as she went by.
She nodded back,
ignoring the other people who tsk&rsquo;ed to each other
at the sight of a scruffy little jelly dredger
in a stained coat two sizes too big for her.</p>
<p>A commotion down a side street caught her ear.
Someone was singing off-key.
Another voice joined in,
and then glass broke on stone.
&ldquo;Bloody pirates,&rdquo; a passer-by muttered to his companion.
&ldquo;Governors shoulda sunk the <em>Taroona</em>, not let her berth.&rdquo;
The second man grunted acknowledgment.
Iffy kept her eyes on the cobblestones and picked up her pace.</p>
<p>Sandhu&rsquo;s grocery store was out of eggs.
They had onions,
though,
and a box of dried green peppers from somewhere carefully unspecified.
Little Mrs. Sandhu wrapped half a dozen slices in wax paper.
&ldquo;For your lovely aunt,&rdquo; she said over Iffy&rsquo;s protests,
just as she always did.
&ldquo;And here,
a little of our special curry mix.
I know how much you like it.&rdquo;
She handed Iffy a small plastic jar of orange-brown powder.</p>
<p>Big Mrs. Sandhu snorted just as <em>she</em> always did.
&ldquo;You should take your presents to Nagatha yourself,&rdquo; she scolded.</p>
<p>Her wife smiled.
&ldquo;<em>La,</em> but where would be the romance in that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Big Mrs. Sandhu snorted again.
Whatever Little Mrs. Sandhu might have said next
was cut short by the bell on the store&rsquo;s front door jingling.
Three heads turned at a cheerful, &ldquo;Good morning!&rdquo;
as the squarest man Iffy had ever seen walked in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Square&rdquo; really was the only word for him.
He wasn&rsquo;t much taller than Iffy,
but three of her could have stood side by side in the span of his shoulders.
Strong white teeth gleamed against his black skin when he smiled,
and the flickering silver rectangles in his temples
made him look like he had stepped out of an adventure sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good mornin, <em>sri</em>,&rdquo; Big Mrs. Sandhu said, dipping her head slightly.
&ldquo;Is there something we could help you with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just some advice, ma&rsquo;am, if you&rsquo;ve any of that for sale?&rdquo;
His twanging accent sounded American to Iffy,
though the only Americans she had ever met had been market preachers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Advice is always free here,&rdquo; Little Mrs. Sandhu simpered,
wiping her hands on her apron.
Big Mrs. Sandhu looked sidelong at Iffy and rolled her eyes.
Iffy bit back a laugh—Little Mrs. Sandhu&rsquo;s flirting was as famous in Halley
as her smuggled vegetables.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you kindly,&rdquo; the square man said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just in from South Georgia,
and it seems that my luggage went missing in transit.
I don&rsquo;t suppose you could recommend somewhere I could stay for a few days that isn&rsquo;t too expensive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh you poor <em>cho</em>,&rdquo; Little Mrs. Sandhu clucked sympathetically.</p>
<p>Big Mrs. Sandhu shook her head.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;d be the <em>Taroona</em> you come in on?&rdquo;
When the newcomer nodded she shook her head again.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re <em>bura badi</em>,
that lot,
pirates and leggers and worse.
You&rsquo;re lucky if all they nickered was your bags an&rsquo; not your kidneys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The square man sighed.
&ldquo;That may be, but I confess that I don&rsquo;t feel particularly lucky.
I was hoping to set myself up in business, but without my tools…&rdquo;
He shrugged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind o&rsquo; tools?&rdquo; Iffy asked.
She had been about to slip away—her uncle would be looking for her soon,
and she didn&rsquo;t want Aunt Naggie to have to deal with his ire alone—but
tools were worth a few extra seconds.</p>
<p>The square man grimaced.
&ldquo;A couple of half-mil waldoes,
a sintering laser,
a fractal de-ionizer for cleaning chaff off old cores,
a set of diffraction lenses,
and—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such thing as a fractal de-ionizer,&rdquo;
Iffy cut in scornfully.</p>
<p>The square man blinked.
&ldquo;Sure there is.
You take the ionizer out of a differential micromagnetic filter,
stick it in a high-conductance fractal mesh,
and zip—there&rsquo;s your de-ionizer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo;
Iffy scoffed.
&ldquo;Feedback would slag that th&rsquo; second you turned it on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re careless, sure,&rdquo; the square man agreed.
&ldquo;You have to recalibrate the impedance every once in a while so that it doesn&rsquo;t overheat.
But if you have a micropore evaporator—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;—you can use liquid nitrogen to quench the thermal,&rdquo;
Iffy finished,
the solution suddenly clear in her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
The newcomer cocked his head,
looking at Iffy as if she was some strange machine brought in for repair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you two are done comparin&rsquo; notes,
there&rsquo;s a couple o&rsquo; places I can point you at,&rdquo;
Big Mrs. Sandhu cut in briskly.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t promise they&rsquo;ll be cheap,
but they&rsquo;re clean,
an&rsquo; you won&rsquo;t wake up in the middle o&rsquo; the night with any o&rsquo; your parts gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; the square man said absently, still studying Iffy.
&ldquo;And if you don&rsquo;t mind me asking another question,
where did your daughter learn so much about tech?
There are people with a lot of years behind them
who wouldn&rsquo;t have thought about the feedback.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Iffy&rsquo;s not ours,&rdquo;
Little Mrs. Sandhu said lightly.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in off the <em>Guinevere</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;
The square man nodded as if that explained everything
and stuck out his hand.
&ldquo;Johnson Wales,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Pleased to meet you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy hesitated,
then took his hand and shook it.
&ldquo;Fifth Ang Kwan, but everyone calls me Iffy.
Pleased to meet you too.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p>Iffy ran all the way back to the pier,
dodging around the people and bots going about their chores
in Halley&rsquo;s narrow cobblestone streets.
A pair of tweaked raccoons gabbled at her
from atop a rack of insulating moss someone had set out to dry in the sun,
the tech in the back of their heads glinting silver in the sun.
Iffy ignored them and kept running.</p>
<p>The barnacle farmers were still bent over their work when she reached the harbor.
She stopped and put her hands on her knees to catch her breath.
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s yer haul?&rdquo; she panted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad,&rdquo; one of them said.
She nudged a scratched blue bucket with her boot.
&ldquo;Prob&rsquo;ly get thirty milligrams outta this when it renders down.
That&rsquo;ll buy a nice dinner.&rdquo;
Her smile showed more gaps than teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good on ya,&rdquo; Iffy said.
She straightened up and walked quickly the rest of the way to the <em>Guinevere</em>,
her lips moving as she practiced what she was going to say.</p>
<p>Metal clanged on metal as she reached the ship.
&ldquo;Affin&rsquo;… shaddin&rsquo;… dammit!&rdquo; Uncle Jack swore,
a wrench in one hand and a screw cuff in the other.
Iffy&rsquo;s heart sank.
He was trying to mend the backstay cable that had snapped a few days ago.
It was a fiddly job at the best of times,
and if he had a hangover…</p>
<p>His scowl darkened as she came up the gangplank.
&ldquo;Where th&rsquo; hole you been, girl?&rdquo; he demanded,
waving the wrench at her.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s work needs done!
An don&rsquo;t give me any excuses!&rdquo;
he continued as Iffy opened her mouth.
&ldquo;You get this mended or so help me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo;
Heads turned on nearby ships as Uncle Jack&rsquo;s bellow echoed across the water.</p>
<p>Iffy&rsquo;s heart sank a second time when she saw the mess waiting for her.
Her uncle had undone the screw cuff holding the frayed backstay cable together
and trimmed the two ends flat.
He hadn&rsquo;t left enough to weave back together,
not without shortening the cable by half a meter.
She would have to swap the whole cable for one of the forestays,
which meant an hour at least of unwinding and hauling.</p>
<p>Uncle Jack crossed his arms,
tapping his wrench against the stained thermal vest
he had worn for as long as Iffy could remember.
&ldquo;So where you been while th&rsquo; rest of us been workin&rsquo;, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Groceries,&rdquo; Iffy said sullenly.
She pulled the mended reciprocating rod out of her jacket and held it up.
&ldquo;Got this fixed too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Jack pulled it roughly from her hand.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see no groceries,&rdquo; he grumbled accusingly,
squinting at the rod
before thrusting it back at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just asked her to pick up a couple o&rsquo; things,&rdquo;
Aunt Naggie said,
sticking her head up through the galley hatch
like a turtle cautiously checking whether the world outside its shell was safe.
&ldquo;Did they have eggs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope, but I got some peppers.&rdquo;
Iffy fished the items she had bought out of her jacket&rsquo;s deep pockets.
&ldquo;Oh, an&rsquo; this is from Little Mrs. Sandhu.&rdquo;
She held up the jar of curry powder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s kind,&rdquo; Aunt Naggie clucked,
tucking everything into her apron.
&ldquo;Did you get anythin&rsquo; more to eat?
I was going t&rsquo; make noodles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s aright, I&rsquo;m not hungry,&rdquo; Iffy lied,
and then she couldn&rsquo;t hold back any longer.
&ldquo;But auntie,
there was a man at Sandhu&rsquo;s,
a mechanic come down to work in the machine shop,
&lsquo;cept he was on the <em>Taroona</em> an&rsquo; they stole his gear
so he was askin&rsquo; after a place to stay,
and we got to talkin&rsquo;,
and he said that if he could get his tools back and find work an&rsquo; all,
he might be lookin&rsquo; for an apprentice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An apprentice?&rdquo; Aunt Naggie echoed.
&ldquo;Well, good for Jeep.
It&rsquo;s about time he got out and did somethin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Jeep!&rdquo; Iffy exclaimed.
&ldquo;He said he&rsquo;d look to take me!&rdquo;
The two Mrs. Sandhus had listened with bemusement
as her conversation with Mister Wales (&ldquo;please, call me Johnson&rdquo;) leaped from de-ionizers
to different ways to micro-weld cracks in cryogenic core cases
to the mended reciprocating rod Iffy took out of her coat to show him.
It wasn&rsquo;t until Big Mrs. Sandhu had cleared her throat
and pointedly suggested that the conversation continue
where they <em>wouldn&rsquo;t</em> be blocking the aisle
that Iffy had realized how much time had gone by.</p>
<p>Uncle Jack&rsquo;s hand came down heavily on her shoulder.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not goin&rsquo; anywhere,&rdquo; he growled,
shaking her for emphasis.
&ldquo;Not &lsquo;til you&rsquo;ve paid off every last rand you owe me
for lookin&rsquo; after you all this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something froze inside Iffy.
&ldquo;Aright,&rdquo; she said coldly,
shrugging off his arm.
&ldquo;How &lsquo;bout you and me go ask the <em>Ginny</em> to pull up the accounts
so I can see just how much that is,
and I&rsquo;ll tell you how much you owe me for keeping her afloat,
and then we&rsquo;ll see who&rsquo;s got a debt t&rsquo; who!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we&rsquo;ll see is how well you swim!&rdquo;
Uncle Jack roared,
raising the heavy wrench he was holding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;
Aunt Naggie yanked Iffy back and stepped in front of her irate husband.
&ldquo;Jack, don&rsquo;t!
She&rsquo;s just talkin&rsquo;,
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Jack shook the wrench at them.
&ldquo;I best see more outta both of you than just talkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he snarled.
&ldquo;Now get me some affin&rsquo; lunch, woman.
And you!&rdquo;
He jabbed a finger at Iffy.
&ldquo;Fix that shaddin&rsquo; cable.
I want us ready t&rsquo; sail tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll do it right away, I promise,&rdquo; Aunt Naggie said.
Her arm tightened around Iffy&rsquo;s shoulders,
a silent warning not to say anything.</p>
<p>Uncle Jack stalked off,
muttering under his breath.
&ldquo;You come below and help me with the noodles,&rdquo;
Aunt Naggie said,
shooing Iffy toward the open hatch.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll give him time to calm down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes auntie,&rdquo; Iffy said,
her voice only slightly shaky.
Uncle Jack had never hit her—as simple-minded as the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s core was,
it would still instantly report that
to the Marines who served as Halley&rsquo;s police.
But with each passing season,
as the ship slowly fell apart beneath them despite Iffy&rsquo;s best efforts,
his if-only stories about big deals that were just over the horizon
had turned into angry tirades and sullen silences.
Iffy didn&rsquo;t know where she would go,
and she couldn&rsquo;t bear the thought of leaving Aunt Naggie to face him alone,
but she knew that one day she would walk down the gangplank and never come back.</p>
<p>One day—but not today.</p>
<p>The <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s galley wasn&rsquo;t big enough for two people to do anything side by side
except get in each other&rsquo;s way,
so Iffy sat at its little fold-down table
and watched Aunt Naggie work with the efficiency of long practice.
Within minutes,
two thinly-sliced onions sizzled in a battered ceramic frying pan
while a pot of desalinated water came to the boil.
A handful of diced mushrooms and a splash of soy sauce joined the onions,
filling the air with a rich aroma that made Iffy&rsquo;s stomach rumble.</p>
<p>The rumbling tightened into a knot as Aunt Naggie added some of her precious spices.
&ldquo;Is that Mrs. Sandhu&rsquo;s curry?&rdquo; Iffy asked,
turning a pair of chopsticks over and over in her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm hm.&rdquo;
Aunt Naggie tucked the little jar back into her apron.
&ldquo;I save it for special occasions.&rdquo;
She dropped a thick handful of noodles into the pot,
glanced at her foster daughter,
and added a few more.</p>
<p>Iffy put the chopsticks back on the table.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so special &lsquo;bout today?&rdquo; she grumbled.</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie smiled without looking up from her cooking.
&ldquo;Any time I cook for just the two of us is special,&rdquo;
she said,
knocking bits of onion off her spatula into the frying pan.
&ldquo;But best we don&rsquo;t mention that to Jack, aright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Iffy said,
feeling a knot in her chest to match the one in her stomach.
She stood up and hugged Aunt Naggie from behind.
&ldquo;You know I love you, aye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her foster mother&rsquo;s shoulders slumped slightly.
She moved the frying pan off the induction loop
and turned around to wrap her arms around the skinny young woman
who had somehow replaced the skinny little girl
she used to sing songs to at bedtime.
&ldquo;I love you too, <em>cho</em>,&rdquo; she said,
kissing Iffy&rsquo;s shaved head.
&ldquo;But when your chance comes, you take it, aright?&rdquo;
She squeezed Iffy.
&ldquo;Now, gimme some room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later Iffy sat down on deck
with her back against the wheelhouse door
and a steaming bowl of noodles in her lap.
She bowed her head and said a brief prayer for the olders she could barely remember,
then began scooping food into her mouth.
Not even the sound of her uncle swearing belowdecks
could spoil the spicy sweetness in her mouth
or the feeling of her belly slowly relaxing.</p>
<p>When the noodles were gone
she wiped the last drops of sauce out of the bowl with her thumb
and licked it.
The faint tang of machine oil on her unwashed hand barely registered.
She sighed.
She would like nothing better than to close her eyes and let the summer sun warm her face,
but the backstay cable <em>did</em> need mending,
and it wasn&rsquo;t as if the engine was going to put itself back together—not
on a ship as simple-minded as the <em>Guinevere</em>.</p>
<p>She patted her coat
to check that the reciprocating rod was still in her pocket
and hauled herself to her feet.
Down at the base of the pier,
one of the barnacle farmers had a pole balanced across her shoulders
with a large bucket on each end.
The other had stacked the smaller buckets on a two-wheeled cart
and was gently lowering their precious sheets of plastic back into the sea.
They would haul in on the next pier tomorrow,
then the next and the next
until their circuit brought them back to where they had started.
They had been doing it since before Iffy was born.
It kept them fed,
but little more,
and Iffy would be damned and drowned before she would let anything like that become her life.</p>
<p>Without warning a sketch materialized somewhere between her eyes and her brain.
Two toothed wheels to reel in the strips of plastic,
a sharp-edged scraper to pry the barnacles off,
a lens connected to a tiny core set just so in a wire frame
to steer the scraper so that it didn&rsquo;t dig into the plastic…
The parts would only cost a dozen rand,
and it would save the old women an hour or two every day.
Mister Mishra had everything except the frame,
but that would be easy to print.
She could actually make it,
she realized with mounting excitement.
She could make it and sell it to the barnacle farmers and—</p>
<p><em>BOOM!</em>
The explosion sounded like someone slamming the world&rsquo;s biggest box down
on the world&rsquo;s biggest table.
A roiling mass of smoke billowed up into the sky on the edge of town.
&ldquo;Oh shad!&rdquo; Iffy gasped.
It was the new machine shop!</p>
<p>A siren wailed.
Others joined it.
She heard Uncle Jack bellow,
&ldquo;What you done now, girl?&rdquo;
but she was already racing down the gangplank.</p>
<p>By the time she reached the machine shop
a small crowd had gathered on the paved turnaround in front of it.
Panic rose in her throat
when she saw that the explosion hadn&rsquo;t been in the building itself
but in the squat blockhouse beside it
where the industrial printer was sitting in quarantine.</p>
<p>One corner of the blockhouse had collapsed
in a tangle of masonry chunks and twisted foam steel beams.
A rough-looking woman in a green and yellow vest
was standing in front of its single door
arguing loudly with two men in dark blue Marine uniforms.
&ldquo;An&rsquo; <em>I</em> said I&rsquo;ll open it when Captain Kerse tells me to!&rdquo;
she said hotly,
uncrossing muscular arms covered in silvery tattoos.</p>
<p>Two more Marines pushed through the crowd,
a drone whining faintly over their heads.
One of them pointed at the sergeant&rsquo;s stripes on his sleeve.
&ldquo;Do you see these, citizen?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;These indicate that I have authority to take action
as I think most consistent with regulations regarding general public safety.
We will therefore proceed to inspect this site regardless of your wishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s lip curled.
&ldquo;Consistent wi&rsquo; regulations, is it?&rdquo; she mimicked.
&ldquo;Well that means nought to me,
mate,
so you an&rsquo; your brainmush friends can—oy!&rdquo;
She stepped sideways to block another Marine as he moved toward the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clear away! Clear away, all o&rsquo; you!&rdquo;
The crowded parted hastily at the shouted order.
Half a dozen sailors pushed through the crowd,
all of them wearing variations on the woman&rsquo;s yellow-and-green vest
with <em>Taroona</em> stencilled on the back.
&ldquo;Uh oh,&rdquo; Iffy heard someone mutter.</p>
<p>The shaven-headed woman leading the new arrivals put her hands on her hips.
&ldquo;Y&rsquo;arra, Bags?&rdquo; she asked,
glaring at the Marine sergeant,
the crowd,
and everything else in sight just in case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joey, Cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; the first woman growled.
&ldquo;Just &lsquo;splainin&rsquo; t&rsquo; these lot that there ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; here needs corra look-in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With respect, citizen,&rdquo; the sergeant said,
his inducted accent making his calm words ridiculous and ominous at the same time,
&ldquo;Any potential danger to the residents or property of Halley
is a proper subject of our attention.
Particularly anything that might turn us into another Bharati.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd murmured.
Twenty years before,
someone&rsquo;s home-brew tech had gone up in flames in Bharati.
Dozens had died as fire swept through the small town,
and dozens more from exposure in the days that followed.
Iffy had never asked Mister Mishra about that night,
but every year,
on the anniversary,
he and the Sandhus and their friends gathered on the piers
to toss handfuls of precious flowers into the sea.</p>
<p>The <em>Taroona</em>&rsquo;s crew ignored the mutters of &ldquo;Too right&rdquo; and &ldquo;Just let &lsquo;em look&rdquo;
from the crowd.
One sailor hefted a gaff hook.
Another wrapped a length of chain around her hand
as the twin or clone beside her rolled her head from side to side to loosen her neck.
&ldquo;Well this ain&rsquo;t Bharati,&rdquo;
Captain Kerse said to the sergeant.
&ldquo;Contract says we&rsquo;re to mind everythin&rsquo; we hauled down from Taz
&lsquo;til Halley core tells us otherways,
so whatever happened here is on us t&rsquo; fix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sergeant looked at the debris on the ground.
&ldquo;Do you regard this as &lsquo;taking care&rsquo;, citizen?&rdquo; has asked pointedly.</p>
<p>The <em>Taroona</em>&rsquo;s captain crossed her arms.
&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t our doin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she said firmly.
&ldquo;Printer don&rsquo;t have any feedstock in it, not yet.
Couldna made a marble, much less a bomb.&rdquo;
She looked up at the drone circling overhead.
&ldquo;So <em>I</em> think this was someone messin&rsquo; around tryin&rsquo; t&rsquo; do us outta bein&rsquo; paid,&rdquo;
she said loudly,
her words aimed at Halley&rsquo;s core and the watching governors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree your analysis is likely,&rdquo; the sergeant said.
&ldquo;But I still insist on inspecting this site directly.&rdquo;
Moving as one,
he and the three Marines beside him
drew their shock sticks from the holsters on their hips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh shad,&rdquo; someone said quietly beside Iffy.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gonna be a jammer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy gulped.
She had never seen a fight worse than teenagers shoving each other,
but Uncle Jack had been in several over the years.
The last time they were in Rothera
he had come back to the <em>Guinevere</em> bruised and bloodied
and uncharacteristically quiet about what had happened.
As the Marines&rsquo; uniform jackets hardened into armor,
she turned to find somewhere safer to be
and bumped right into Johnson Wales.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Scuse me,&rdquo; she muttered before she realized who he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No worries,&rdquo; he said pleasantly.
&ldquo;I was actually just leaving myself.
Here—could you give me a hand?&rdquo;
Without waiting for an answer
he handed her a bulky black case with a flip-up handle on its lid
and stooped to pick up its two identical twins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What—?&rdquo; Iffy started to ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ssh!&rdquo;
Wales cut her off and looked up at the drone circling overhead.
Without warning its buzzing stopped
and it fell from the sky like a rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oy, that weren&rsquo;t us!&rdquo; Captain Kerse protested,
but it was too late.
As the drone clattered on the cobblestones,
the sergeant blew his whistle.</p>
<p>The Marines charged the sailors.
A shock stick sizzled and cracked.
Someone shouted an obscenity,
and suddenly people were running past Iffy
as the sailors and Marines did what sailors and Marines have been doing
for as long as there have been sailors and Marines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Wales urged Iffy.
She hurried after him,
the case bumping against her leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oy!&rdquo; a voice shouted.
&ldquo;You there!
Where th&rsquo; hole d&rsquo;you think you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
A rangy man in a yellow-and-green vest with a half-star tattooed on his face
shoved a couple of people out of his way and grabbed Iffy by the arm.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a picture in her head
like a wireframe of a machine labelled with angles and velocities.
She spun around,
swinging the case in a sharp arc.
Its rising edge hit the <em>Taroona</em> crewman beneath his knee with an audible crack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aargh! Shaddin&rsquo; hack, ya wheezy—&rdquo;
The case in Wales&rsquo; right hand thudded against the sailor&rsquo;s head.
He collapsed to the cobblestones in a heap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;
Wales urged as two of the <em>Taroona</em>&rsquo;s crew spotted their fallen comrade
and began shoving their way through the panic to even the score.</p>
<p>Iffy ran,
or tried to,
but the case was heavy and awkward
and the women chasing her were half again her height
and could knock people aside instead of going around them
or pushing in between them.
What had just happened?
How could she have seen what she needed to do like that?</p>
<p>Just as one of the sailors yelled, &ldquo;Gotcha!&rdquo;
a dirty gray shape darted out from behind a barrel.
The sailor tripped over the raccoon and fell to the cobblestones
with a surprised curse.
The sailor behind her skidded to a halt,
only to be sent staggering as their third crewmate plowed into her from behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get off me!&rdquo;
the first sailor shouted as another raccoon scampered across her back.
A third and then a fourth emerged from their hiding places,
growing and hissing at the sailors
as the tech in the backs of their heads sparkled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;
Wales pulled Iffy away.</p>
<p>For the next few moments it was all Iffy could do to stay on her feet.
Just when she thought she couldn&rsquo;t hold onto the case any longer
Wales pulled her into a side alley.
A few drops of sweat glistened on his forehead.
&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; he asked,
breathing heavily.</p>
<p>Iffy dropped the case on the ground and doubled over to catch her breath.
&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not aright!&rdquo; she wheezed.
&ldquo;I just about got my chomper clocked back there!
And what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;
She kicked the case with the toe of her boot.
&ldquo;This what th&rsquo; <em>Taroona</em> bikkies upped from you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales nodded.
&ldquo;Everything that matters.&rdquo;
Tiny lights danced briefly across the silver rectangles in his temples.
He looked up as an angry drone buzzed overhead.
Another followed it a moment later.
&ldquo;Come on.
The Marines have called for reinforcements—we should be somewhere else when they arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales led her out the other end of the alley
onto a narrow street lined with two-story houses made of laser-cut stones.
Sparkling blue-green moss traced their mortared joints.
It was strangely quiet after the commotion on the street.
The only sounds were the gulls,
the faint hum of an autotruck passing by,
and their boots on the cobblestones.</p>
<p>Iffy struggled to keep up with Wales
as he strode confidently toward the center of town.
The sailors and townsfolk she knew ranged from lean to stringy:
cold weather and the sparse Antarctic diet didn&rsquo;t give bodies much chance to put on weight.
Wales&rsquo; broad shoulders made him look boxy by comparison,
and the cases he was carrying seemed much smaller in his hands than in hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang a jif,&rdquo; Iffy finally puffed.
Wales stopped as she set her load down on the ground to catch her breath.
Between the Marines&rsquo; inducted fighting skills,
their drones,
and their armor,
the <em>Taroona</em>&rsquo;s sailors would have had about as much chance
as a snowball in Aunt Naggie&rsquo;s frying pan.
&ldquo;Sometimes folk fight just so they can tell themselves they did,&rdquo;
Aunt Naggie had explained with a shrug
after one of Uncle Jack&rsquo;s misadventures.</p>
<p>She jumped and squawked as a raccoon poked its head up out of a drain near her feet.
The tech set into its fur sparkled briefly as it gabbled at Wales.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it sayin&rsquo;?&rdquo; Iffy whispered loudly,
unconsciously backing up a step.
Halley tolerated a handful of tweaked animals for the jobs they could do,
but there were too many stories of them being driven mad by malware left over from the war
for her to be truly comfortable around one.</p>
<p>Wales didn&rsquo;t seem bothered.
&ldquo;Thank you, my friend.&rdquo;
He pulled something that looked like a gray ceramic waffle out of his pocket.
&ldquo;Here. This is for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The raccoon stood on its back feet and plucked the object from Wales&rsquo; hand.
It was a heat exchanger,
Iffy realized,
a tiny sibling of one that Mister Mishra had repaired for her
the last time the <em>Guinevere</em> was in dock.</p>
<p>A blueprint materialized in her head.
The heat exchanger belonged in the housing around a quantum relay
of the kind that collectives of tweaked animals used to communicate with each other.
With that came the knowledge that the raccoons had been designed during the war
to worm their way through pipes and narrow spaces without being detected.
The tech in the raccoon&rsquo;s back was made of scraps recycled many times over,
but the original design was still clear beneath the patchwork—or would have been
if she could actually see it with her eyes.</p>
<p>The vision faded
as the raccoon tucked the heat exchanger into a pouch strapped to its belly.
It gabbled again before disappearing back into the drain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was <em>that</em> all about?&rdquo;
Iffy demanded.</p>
<p>Wales shrugged.
&ldquo;Just a hard-to-find part to help an old friend,&rdquo; he said,
sounding fond and sad at the same time.
&ldquo;Come on—we should get going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh huh,&rdquo;
Iffy said without moving.
&ldquo;Must be pretty affin&rsquo; special for it to chance blowin&rsquo; itself up
or bein&rsquo; scragged for sabotage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Wales didn&rsquo;t answer she prodded the case next to her with her boot again.
&ldquo;That <em>was</em> you and them, wasn&rsquo;t it? The &lsquo;splosion back there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales blinked.
&ldquo;Why on earth would you think that was me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy rolled her eyes.
&ldquo;Cuz they naffled your gear an&rsquo; then the blockhouse just happens to blow up
an&rsquo; then the critters that takes care o&rsquo; the town&rsquo;s sewers an&rsquo; all
just happen to be friends o&rsquo; yours
an&rsquo; now you got your stuff back?
I ain&rsquo;t <em>stupid</em>,&rdquo; she finished disgustedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No you&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; Wales agreed thoughtfully.
He nodded at the case next to her feet.
&ldquo;Are you okay to carry that a bit further?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy crossed her arms in unconscious imitation of the <em>Taroona</em>&rsquo;s captain
and raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>Wales smiled briefly.
&ldquo;Sorry.
Arra joey t&rsquo; carry at down s&rsquo;far as we go along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy made a face.
&ldquo;That was <em>terrible</em>,&rdquo; she judged witheringly.
&ldquo;And sure, but only if I get t&rsquo; see what&rsquo;s in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales chuckled.
&ldquo;Fair enough.&rdquo;
He glanced up as one last drone zipped past overhead.
Lights sparkled briefly in the rectangle set into his temple,
making Iffy wonder exactly what the drones were reporting to Halley&rsquo;s central core.</p>
<p>They picked up their loads and walked side by side
past the Sandhus&rsquo; grocery
to the café where Wales had rented an upstairs room.
The owner glanced from Wales to Iffy to the cases
but said nothing more than, &ldquo;Tea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat at one of the café&rsquo;s stone-topped tables
and sipped the strong, minty brew from mis-matched ceramic mugs
the size of Iffy&rsquo;s doubled fists.
Wales sighed contentedly,
then set his drink aside,
lifted the case Iffy had been carrying onto the table,
and opened it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa,&rdquo; Iffy breathed.
Some of the tools inside looked as good as new,
though they had to be at least a hundred years old—only
a handful of well-defended factories scattered around the world
still had the cleanrooms and nano-fabricators needed
to create marvels like the fractal iridium mesh that
Wales briefly let her inspect
through a monocle made from a single perfectly-formed diamond.
Other tools were clearly cobbled together
from whatever spare parts Wales had been able to find.
Iffy felt more comfortable with these,
since pretty much everything in Halley was built the same way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about those?&rdquo; she asked eagerly,
pointing at a nested set of asymmetric gears
as Wales carefully repacked everything.</p>
<p>The square man chuckled.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s save them for another time.&rdquo;
The squares in his temples flickered.
&ldquo;The town says the explosion by the quarantine shed
was apparently a result of faulty maintenance
on an outflow pipe that wasn&rsquo;t registered in the town plans.
Oh,
and the Marines have resolved the disturbance
involving the crew of an unnamed Australian vessel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy snorted.
&ldquo;Faulty maintenance my orphaned arse.
I know that was you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I have no idea what you mean,&rdquo;
Wales said drily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh huh.&rdquo;
Iffy glanced at the clock painted on café wall.
&ldquo;Oh crivens,&rdquo; she swore,
scrambling to her feet.
She&rsquo;d been gone nearly half an hour—Aunt Naggie would be worried sick
and Uncle Jack would be furious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; Wales said, patting the air.
&ldquo;Just a minute, I promise.
Tell me more about this ship of yours…&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales locked his toolboxes in his room before they left
and put a small toy bear on the shelf above them.
&ldquo;To keep an eye on things,&rdquo;
he said,
tapping the tech in his temple.
Iffy nodded—smart toys were an everyday thing,
even for someone who had grown up as poor as she had.
She didn&rsquo;t know what the orange-and-red globe of Mars next to the bear was for,
but she suspected it would do more than just spin if someone broke in.</p>
<p>A pair of bulky gray drones hovered over the harbor
as Iffy and Wales walked down to the pier.
&ldquo;Keeping an eye on the <em>Taroona</em>,&rdquo; Wales guessed,
shielding his eyes with his hand to study them.
&ldquo;Those forks on the front are ultrasonics.
One zap from them and you&rsquo;ll have a headache for a week.
The nozzles behind them probably spray strangle foam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are they just watchin&rsquo;?&rdquo; Iffy asked.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t the Marines just haul everyone in for the governors to sort out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales sighed.
&ldquo;Politics.
Even if they <em>did</em> blow up the quarantine building,
the <em>Taroona</em> and the rest of the Australian fleet
are the only thing stopping the Brazilians from walking in here.
I expect the captain and her crew will be out by morning,&rdquo;
he continued,
speaking to himself as much as to the frowning tween beside him.
&ldquo;Which is another reason I need to talk to your uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;oughta know he don&rsquo;t keep his word &lsquo;less it suits him,&rdquo;
Iffy warned.
&ldquo;Or &lsquo;less he figures you got some serious haul back o&rsquo; you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales nodded.
&ldquo;Thank you—I&rsquo;ll keep that in mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later Uncle Jack scoffed,
&ldquo;No affin&rsquo; way!
We&rsquo;re a jelly dredger,
not a ferryboat!
You wanna hitch up along Rothera,
get yourself three piers over and buy a ticket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales&rsquo; polite expression didn&rsquo;t waver.
&ldquo;I understand it&rsquo;s not your usual line of work,&rdquo;
he said smoothly
when the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s bleary-eyed captain paused for breath.
&ldquo;And if no is your final answer,
I&rsquo;ll respect that and take my business elsewhere.
But!&rdquo;
He held up a hand to forestall another outburst.
&ldquo;What if I could do more than just pay for my passage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Jack snorted.
He had been dozing when Iffy and Wales reached the <em>Guinevere</em>,
and from his squint and the smell on his breath
Iffy guessed that she&rsquo;d find at least one empty bottle in the recycling
if she bothered to go and look.
&ldquo;Lemme guess—you can sing.
Or no—you can do magic tricks and turn jellyfish into gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost,&rdquo; Wales nodded.
&ldquo;Except it isn&rsquo;t magic, and the gold will be all yours.&rdquo;
He tapped the tech in his temple.
&ldquo;This is a satellite uplink.
A <em>fully functional</em> satellite uplink,&rdquo;
he continued as Uncle Jack opened his mouth.
&ldquo;Which means I can spot patches of sea boil with half an hour to spare—maybe more.
And <em>that</em> means—&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Jack said a word that sent Aunt Naggie&rsquo;s hand flying to her mouth.
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t no such thing,&rdquo;
the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s captain sneered.
&ldquo;Not since th&rsquo; war—everyone knows that.
The sats are all encrypted an&rsquo; th&rsquo; keys are long gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are indeed encrypted,&rdquo; Wales agreed.
&ldquo;But as for the keys…&rdquo;
He closed his eyes.
&ldquo;Your beacon is GUIN40782, is that right?&rdquo;
He nodded to himself without waiting for an answer.
&ldquo;Your last trip, you were at sea nine days.
You spent most of it over the Berkner Rise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what?&rdquo; Uncle Jack contemptuously.
&ldquo;Everyone &lsquo;round here dredges the Berk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some with more luck than others,&rdquo; Wales observed coolly.
&ldquo;Take the <em>Whitstable</em>, for example.
The jellyfish they dredged came up in a boil
just twenty kay northeast of you.
If you&rsquo;d known it was happening,
they could have been yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Jack scowled.
The <em>Whitstable</em> was tied up two piers over,
her captain overseeing a refit
paid for by the full hold she had brought back
the day after the <em>Guinevere</em> had returned.
Her crew had been celebrating their good fortune in Halley&rsquo;s shops and bars ever since.</p>
<p>Uncle Jack scratched his cheek through his uncombed beard.
Iffy could practically hear him resenting the other ship&rsquo;s good luck.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re shaddin&rsquo; me,&rdquo; he growled.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way you could know somethin&rsquo; like that before it happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales didn&rsquo;t answer.
Instead,
he closed his eyes again and pointed toward the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s stern.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a pair of Aussie freighters a hundred and forty kay that way,
core pilots and human crews,
carrying…&rdquo;
He paused.
&ldquo;Profile looks like grain,
but they have something heavier for ballast.
Smuggling in machinery to swap for coal, most likely.&rdquo;
He swung his arm twenty degrees like a weathervane.
&ldquo;The <em>Peacock</em>, the <em>Reculver</em>, and the <em>Watney Breach</em> are dredging together.
They&rsquo;re not going to find much—the sea bottom there
might as well be concrete.&rdquo;
He swung his arm again.
&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s a Brazilian catamaran out that way,
three hundred kay and bearing northwest.&rdquo;
He smiled slightly.
&ldquo;She looks like an old lady dressed up for church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned back to them and opened his eyes.
&ldquo;I can get all of it,&rdquo;
he said in a voice that left no room for doubt or disagreement.
&ldquo;Every image, every signal.
And I need to get to Rothera.
The only question is, will that be your good fortune or someone else&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; Aunt Naggie began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet,&rdquo; her husband snapped, greed and mistrust warring on his face.
&ldquo;We keep whatever we haul,&rdquo; he finally said.
&ldquo;And the moment we tie up,
you&rsquo;re off and I never heard o&rsquo; you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair enough,&rdquo; Wales agreed.
He stuck out his hand.</p>
<p>Iffy held her breath.
Uncle Jack scowled a moment longer,
then grabbed it and gave it a single perfunctory shake.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m guessin&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll want to be off right away,&rdquo; he said sourly.</p>
<p>Wales nodded.
&ldquo;Just as soon as I collect my—&rdquo;
He froze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Uncle Jack demanded.
Wales raised a hand for silence, his eyes half-closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; Uncle Jack blustered,
drawing himself up to his full height.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t shush me on my ship, you—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone is breaking into my room.&rdquo;
Wales said curtly.
&ldquo;Get ready to cast off.
I&rsquo;ll be back in ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll cast off when <em>I</em> say!&rdquo;
Uncle Jack said angrily.</p>
<p>Iffy&rsquo;s heart sank.
Telling Uncle Jack what to do <em>always</em> made him do the opposite.</p>
<p>But her uncle&rsquo;s anger had no more effect on Wales
than a windstorm on a mountain.
&ldquo;Here.&rdquo;
He pulled a money out of his jacket and thrust it at Uncle Jack.
&ldquo;A down payment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Jack turned the black plastic rectangle over in his hands suspiciously.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it worth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixty thousand rand,&rdquo; Wales said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixty <em>thousand</em>?&rdquo;
Uncle Jack pressed his thumb on the corner of the money.
His eyes narrowed at the blinking figures it displayed.
&ldquo;You must wanna get outta here pretty badly,&rdquo;
he mused,
looking Wales up and down as if measuring him for a funeral suit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use to me if I can&rsquo;t spend it,&rdquo;
Wales said crisply.
&ldquo;Do we still have a deal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Jack grunted and pocketed the card.
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Wales said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be quick.&rdquo;
He turned to go, then stopped himself and tapped his temple again.
&ldquo;Just so you know, this is still switched on.
So if you try to call the Marines, I&rsquo;ll know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Jack spat over the taffrail.
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t nobody here calls the Blues,&rdquo; he growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And none of your business associates either, please,&rdquo;
Wales added coolly.
&ldquo;Or I&rsquo;ll send the Marines to call on <em>them</em>
and make it look like you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales strode down the gangplank before Uncle Jack could reply,
lengthening his stride into a jog
that carried him along the pier and into town.
&ldquo;That one&rsquo;s trouble,&rdquo; Uncle Jack said flatly.
He leaned his elbows on the taffrail and spat again into the water below.
There were more lines on his face than there used to be,
Iffy noticed,
and the three-day fuzz on his shaved scalp
had crept further and further away from his forehead.</p>
<p>Uncle Jack noticed her looking at him.
&ldquo;Well, get movin&rsquo;!&rdquo; he barked,
straightening up.
&ldquo;You too,&rdquo; he added to Aunt Naggie.
&ldquo;I want us away from whatever&rsquo;s chasin&rsquo; him soon as he&rsquo;s back.&rdquo;
He strode away,
muttering to himself.</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie and Iffy whooshed out their breath at the same time.
&ldquo;You gonna tell me what&rsquo;s abunder?&rdquo; Aunt Naggie asked.</p>
<p>Iffy shrugged helplessly.
&ldquo;I dunno, auntie, true I don&rsquo;t.
There was a jammer up along by quarantine,
an&rsquo; some raccoons got into it, and…&rdquo;
<em>And all of a sudden I know how to tag someone twice my size,</em>
she almost added but didn&rsquo;t.
Bots weren&rsquo;t the only ones infected with malware during the war.
Talking about her visions with anyone—even Aunt Naggie—would open a door
she would rather keep closed.</p>
<p>But something in her expression caught Aunt Naggie&rsquo;s eye.
She put her hand on Iffy&rsquo;s forehead.
&ldquo;Just be still,&rdquo; she shushed,
stern and worried at the same time.
After a moment she took her hand away,
but her expression didn&rsquo;t change.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no fever.
How about you start gettin&rsquo; us ready and I&rsquo;ll make somethin&rsquo; quick to eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tea&rsquo;d be nice,&rdquo; Iffy said gratefully.</p>
<p>It normally took a full day to get the <em>Guinevere</em> ready to sail,
but the money in Uncle Jack&rsquo;s pocket seemed to make him believe it could be done in a blink.
He roared at Iffy and Aunt Naggie to move their sorry sterns,
and no,
don&rsquo;t worry about tyin&rsquo; that down,
they could take care of it once they were at sea,
just put it somewhere for now and get the affin&rsquo; engine goin&rsquo;!</p>
<p>It took Iffy five minutes of careful work to put the reciprocating rod back in place.
Five more minutes and the engine was chugging away,
biofuel gurgling through kinks in the feed pipe
that she had never been able to get rid of.
She would normally have checked the winch motor
to make sure they could haul in whatever they caught,
but instead she laced some straps around the fine mesh dredging nets
to stop them shifting or tangling in high seas.
Wait—the fuel hose!
It was still connected to the pump on the pier.
If they had set sail without undoing it,
it would have snapped like an overstretched rubber band.
She had seen that happen once.
It had sounded like a gunshot,
and the end had torn open an unlucky sailor&rsquo;s cheek.</p>
<p>She scrambled up the ladder that connected the engine room to the deck.
&ldquo;Ready below,&rdquo; she called.</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie coiled the last stayline and shoved it into a canvas bag,
then shoved the bag into a bench locker and dogged the seat-lid shut.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all for me too.&rdquo;
She handed Iffy half a sandwich—scrambled egg with more of Mrs. Sandhu&rsquo;s curry—and
waited for her foster daughter to wolf it down
before thumping the cabin wall with her fist.
&ldquo;Good when you are,&rdquo; she shouted,
confident as she always was when something needed to be done.</p>
<p>The cabin door flew open.
Uncle Jack stepped out onto deck,
glaring at his wife and foster daughter on principle.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I said,&rdquo; he told the empty air impatiently.
&ldquo;Fifty thousand rand.
I&rsquo;ll have it in a week.
What?
Never you mind how, but that&rsquo;ll more&rsquo;n put us square.
Right.
Aright.
What?
No, you affin&rsquo; well better <em>not</em> tell her,
or she&rsquo;ll skin both of us!
Right.
Aright.
<em>Vi da</em>.&rdquo;
He blinked twice to end the call and bared his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was that?&rdquo; Aunt Naggie asked cautiously.</p>
<p>Uncle Jack&rsquo;s self-satisfied smile vanished.
&ldquo;Ne&rsquo;er you mind,&rdquo; he said brusquely.
&ldquo;Everythin&rsquo; stowed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everythin&rsquo; that&rsquo;s gonna be,&rdquo; Aunt Naggie said.
&ldquo;But Jack—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, ne&rsquo;er mind!&rdquo;
He slapped the taffrail with his hand.
&ldquo;Now where&rsquo;s our high-top troublemaker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five more minutes crawled by,
each one tenser than the last,
until Wales appeared at the end of the pier
with a toolbox in each hand.
The third hung over his shoulder on a strap,
and he had a small travelling pack on his back.</p>
<p>Iffy scurried down the gangplank and ran to him.
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo;
Wales said gratefully
as she took one of the boxes from his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No worries,&rdquo; Iffy replied.
Then she gasped.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re bleeding!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still?&rdquo;
Wales pulled a rag out of his pocket and dabbed a scrape on his cheek.
&ldquo;So I am.&rdquo;
He put the rag back in his pocket and limped toward the <em>Guinevere</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;
Iffy puffed as she fell into step beside him.
&ldquo;Was someone really tryin&rsquo; t&rsquo; break into your room?
Were they along from the <em>Taroona</em>?
Did you get punched up?
And what&rsquo;s wrong with your leg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, everything was mostly sorted out by the time I got there,&rdquo;
Wales said vaguely.
&ldquo;And my leg&rsquo;s bothered me for years.
I really should get it looked at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Jack didn&rsquo;t wait for Wales to stow his belongings
before hauling in the gangplank and casting off.
The engine rumbled and coughed for a moment
as they pulled away from the pier,
then settled into the steady thumping that was as familiar to Iffy as her own breathing.</p>
<p>They were halfway across the harbor when a klaxon blared.
Iffy ran to the stern in time to see
a flock of drones converge on a pier halfway around the harbor
from the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s berth.</p>
<p>A single ship lay alongside the pier,
long and low and gray and dangerous—the <em>Taroona</em>.
Iffy shaded her eyes with her hand.
The ship looked like she was casting off,
but no,
a pair of Marine zodiacs had boxed her in
and a platoon of figures in blue were trotting down the pier.
She glanced at Wales,
wondering if this was somehow his doing,
but the American&rsquo;s eyes were on the horizon ahead of them.</p>
<p>They rounded the broken-backed carrier that was Halley&rsquo;s seawall a few minutes later.
The swell beneath them instantly grew stronger.
Uncle Jack took the first watch,
grumbling that if they were hauled in by the Marines
everyone should just let him do the talking.
Aunt Naggie said she would take the second watch,
then shooed Iffy off to sleep.
&ldquo;You can talk to Mister Johnson t&rsquo;morrow,&rdquo;
she said firmly.
&ldquo;Let him have his rest now.&rdquo;
Then she smiled the way she only did
when she and her foster daughter were alone together.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need some too
if you&rsquo;re gonna go chattin&rsquo; up that special friend o&rsquo; yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honesty ain&rsquo;t special!&rdquo; Iffy protested automatically.
Still smiling,
her foster mother pulled her into a hug and kissed the shaven top of her head,
then gently closed the door of the storage locker behind her.</p>
<p>Iffy took her nature book out from under her mattress
and lay on her stomach to page through it.
The orca, the tiger, the gorilla…
She ran her fingers over the pictures,
sounding out the handwritten comments beside them.
<em>Mom took us to see the baby giraffes today,</em> said one.
<em>There are three of them.
They are clones and they live in a big dome because of the virus.
Mom says they have been tweaked to be immune to it.</em>
And then,
in an older version of the same hand,
<em>Turns out they weren&rsquo;t.
Mom says there isn&rsquo;t money to try again.</em>
And then there was a sad cartoon face,
one of several scattered through the book.</p>
<p>Iffy browsed the other animals,
wondering what it would have been like to live in a world
that had so many different kinds of creatures.
She stubbornly tried to keep her eyelids from closing
until she couldn&rsquo;t remember why they shouldn&rsquo;t.
When she finally dozed, she dreamed.</p>
<p><em>She was on deck.
The sky was a perfect blue,
and her olders were stuffing her into her ecosuit.
&ldquo;Just in case, love,&rdquo; Second said, forcing a smile.</em></p>
<p><em>When the ship&rsquo;s horn blared it wasn&rsquo;t a horn at all
but the sound of a drill press.
She was in Mister Mishra&rsquo;s,
fumbling clumsily to reassemble a mound of chips and gears and actuators
that she had never seen before.
Her heart raced as she tried to piece them together.
This rod into that socket—no,
that couldn&rsquo;t be right,
it turned the wrong way and didn&rsquo;t leave enough space for the lens,
because the lens had to go there,
it had to,
she didn&rsquo;t know how she knew but she did and time was running out.</em></p>
<p><em>And then suddenly she could see the whole design
from the overall schematic
down to the bevelled teeth of the microscopic gears
that would catch and grind on specks of dust too small to see or feel
if they weren&rsquo;t assembled just so in airtight diamond cases.
There and there,
that&rsquo;s where the hair-fine optical fibers had to go,
and there,
right in the machine&rsquo;s heart,
was the space where a miniaturized core could—</em></p>
<p><em>The whole room heeled hard, throwing her to the floor.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gonna blow!&rdquo; Mister Mishra shouted,
and then all Iffy could hear was a rushing sound
as the ship fell away beneath her into a pit of churning foam.</em></p>
<p>She woke up drenched in sweat.
She kicked her way out of her sleeping bag,
rolled over,
and buried her face in her mattress.
When her tears finally ran dry she wiped her nose angrily on her sleeve,
rolled onto her back,
and fumbled on the floor beside her for her water bottle
before remembering that she hadn&rsquo;t refilled it.
&ldquo;Idiot,&rdquo; she muttered,
thumping her fist against her mattress.</p>
<p>It took her a long time to fall asleep again.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p>It was four days to Rothera across the Weddell Sea.
Once upon a time they would have driven across a solid sheet of ice.
During the Melt they would have had to thread their way through cakes and bergs,
but those days were long gone.
There was nothing between them and their destination except hungry gulls,
floating plastic,
and the faint but ever-present risk of the sea turning to foam beneath them.</p>
<p>Halley quickly fell below the horizon.
After motoring for an hour under high, thin clouds,
Uncle Jack ordered the <em>Guinevere</em> to raise her sails.
The ship&rsquo;s tiny core obediently ran mis-matched gossamer sheets up her twin Y-masts.
Waves a meter high made the ship rock from side to side
in a rhythm that Iffy knew as well as she knew her own heartbeat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best stay outta th&rsquo; way,&rdquo; Aunt Naggie advised
when her foster daughter clambered down into the galley to get tea.
&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t used t&rsquo; havin&rsquo; folk on board, but I &lsquo;spect he&rsquo;ll settle in.&rdquo;
It sounded more like a prayer than a prediction,
but Iffy nodded and climbed back on deck
with a chipped ceramic mug in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bout affin&rsquo; time,&rdquo; her uncle said sharply
when she knocked on the door of the pilot house and handed the tea to him.
He slurped a mouthful and set it in the ring next to the ship&rsquo;s wheel.</p>
<p>Iffy glanced at the control panel.
Tiny cameras dotted about the ship showed the engine,
the hold,
the sails,
and practically everything else on board
except the insides of the cabins and the cramped toilet near the stern.
Small graphs scattered among the images told her at a glance
how much fuel they had,
how much tension was in the forestays and mainstays,
and what the wind and the currents around them were doing.</p>
<p>The most important display was the sonar.
Every captain kept a close eye on that if they wanted to make it home.
At the first sign of gas bubbling up from the thawing ocean floor,
they would fire up the engine and run.</p>
<p>Uncle Jack jerked a thumb at a panel highlighted in orange.
&ldquo;You get that backstay cable mended soonish if you want lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yessir,&rdquo; Iffy said obediently.
He&rsquo;d been drinking again, she realized.
She could smell it on his breath,
and from the way he clutched the wheel to hold himself steady
she guessed he&rsquo;d been at it for a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; see if that baggage o&rsquo; yours wants t&rsquo; make himself useful as well,&rdquo;
Uncle Jack added as she turned to go.
&ldquo;Or better yet, just tell &lsquo;im I told him to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales had reorganized the ship&rsquo;s other storage locker while Iffy was asleep
to make room for his pack and toolboxes.
He was seated on a thwart at the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s stern,
seemingly lost in thought,
but said, &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; in reply to Iffy&rsquo;s tentative request for help.
Standing,
he straightened his jacket and smiled.
&ldquo;Being useful would do me good right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thinkin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout them off th&rsquo; <em>Taroona</em>?
Not that it&rsquo;s any o&rsquo; my look-in,&rdquo;
she added hastily.</p>
<p>Wales shook his head.
&ldquo;No,
I was thinking about the <em>Landrieu</em>.
The big ship back at Halley,&rdquo;
he continued as Iffy gave him a blank look.
&ldquo;The one the town uses as a breakwater.
She was a marvel in her time.
Fractal carbon ribs,
a foamed poly-composite hull,
and a core smart enough to qualify for citizenship.
She was the first of her kind to solo the Pacific,
but then the war came, and…&rdquo;
He sighed.
&ldquo;It must have broken her heart to end up like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; Iffy said to fill the silence that followed.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t imagine how I&rsquo;d feel if somethin&rsquo; like that happened to th&rsquo; <em>Ginny</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope you never have to find out,&rdquo; Wales said.
He shook his head to clear it.
&ldquo;Now, where&rsquo;s this cable we&rsquo;re supposed to mend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy had hoped that Wales would bring out his toolboxes—she
was itching to examine their contents in detail.
Instead,
he studied the hacked-off ends of the backstay cable
with a hand-held smart lens
that highlighted the worse of the damage in garish reds and yellows.
Iffy wanted to tell him that it wasn&rsquo;t her fault,
but she bit back her words.
There was no way she could say that without pointing the finger at Uncle Jack,
and as much as she wanted him to think well of her,
no self-respecting sailor would ever cast shade on her captain
in front of a passenger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Wales said,
slipping the magnifier back into one of his coat&rsquo;s many pockets.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the plan—splice, clamp, strap, or weld?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinkin&rsquo; I could splice it?&rdquo; Iffy ventured.
When Wales nodded
she fished a roll of twisted eight-gauge cable from her bag of odds and ends
and dug around to find a wire cutter and a pair of needle-nosed pliers.</p>
<p>The next hour flew by as Iffy lost herself in the task at hand.
She had expected Wales to take charge,
but instead he asked one question after another,
drawing ideas out of her that she hadn&rsquo;t known were there.
It was like the schematics that sometimes popped into her head
but without the chill in her gut of wondering where they&rsquo;d come from.</p>
<p>Once the first dozen lengths of splice were woven into the cable
Wales sat cross-legged on the deck and held the ends together
so that Iffy could finish connecting them.
She worked as quickly as she could,
waiting for him to say it was time for a break,
but he didn&rsquo;t.
<em>Uncle Jack wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to hold the cable like that,</em> she thought.
Even Mister Mishra would have struggled after a few minutes,
but Wales seemed unbothered.
She glanced at the silver rectangles in his temples
and wondered what other tech he might have that wasn&rsquo;t so visible.</p>
<p>Over, through, under, through…
&ldquo;There.&rdquo; She sat back on her haunches.
&ldquo;Wanna see if it holds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales stood,
trapped one end of the cable under his boot,
and pulled hard.
The splice stretched slightly,
and for a moment Iffy was afraid it would give way,
but it held.
&ldquo;Looks good to me.
Well done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy shrugged, embarrassed by the praise.
&ldquo;Only one way t&rsquo; find out for sure.&rdquo;
She hit the switch on the winch beside her.
The cable zinged as it was wound taut.
Iffy picked up a wrench and whacked the splice a couple of times as hard as she could.</p>
<p>Wales blinked. &ldquo;Are you always this direct when you&rsquo;re working?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy grinned. &ldquo;Pretty much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were other things to mend after the cable.
There always were on the <em>Guinevere</em>:
a spidery network of microscopic cracks on the forward mast,
a loose coupling on a bilge pipe,
and a handle on the main hatch
that had started sticking mid-way through their last voyage.
Like most of the vessels that called Halley home
the <em>Guinevere</em> was constructed from materials that could no longer be made,
only repaired.
Keeping her afloat was a matter of swaps and trades and patches,
of scouring noticeboards in Hell
to find tips that weren&rsquo;t self-replicating spamotage left over from the war,
of swapping messages with other mechanics who were trying to keep their own ships running,
and of running sims to see if this patched with that
would hold together in sub-zero temperatures.
In the end,
though,
it always came down to the combination of clever hands,
brute force,
and improvisation that Iffy had used on the cable.
She loved it.</p>
<p>Wales worked beside her the whole time,
handing her tools
and holding things steady while she screwed them in
or used her cherished little laser to put a patch on a weld
that held an even older patch in place.
He somehow managed to keep up a steady stream of questions
without making her feel like he was pestering.
She enjoyed every minute of it,
just like she enjoyed the times
when Mister Mishra turned something she&rsquo;d made over and over in his hands
and pronounced it well done,
or when Uncle Jack was sound asleep
and Aunt Naggie told her stories about growing up in Mzansi
before the long drought.</p>
<p>Wales seemed to enjoy the work as well,
right up until the moment he helped Iffy lift the cover off the backup motor
near the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s stern.
His face fell at the sight of its compact, soot-stained bulk.
&ldquo;Y&rsquo;aright?&rdquo; Iffy asked,
fanning away the smell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Wales said,
gazing down at the filthy ceramic engine block.
&ldquo;I just thought you ran on jelly render, not coal dust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The main engine&rsquo;s a jelly-burner,&rdquo; Iffy said.
&ldquo;This here is just for when it&rsquo;s bust,
or for haulin&rsquo; the winches when there&rsquo;s ice &lsquo;n&rsquo; all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The square-faced man sighed.
&ldquo;But—coal? Really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy&rsquo;s eyes widened.
&ldquo;Oh crivens—you ain&rsquo;t an eco, are you?
Uncle Jack&rsquo;ll put you o&rsquo;er the side an&rsquo; no mistake.
He hates ecos even worse&rsquo;n he hates Zillions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales sighed again.
&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not an Ecologist.
Or Brazilian, for that matter.
I just…&rdquo;
He squatted on his haunches and looked resignedly at the engine.
&ldquo;Come on. Let&rsquo;s get this done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He asked fewer questions after that,
but despite his obvious distaste he clearly knew how coal engines worked.
Half an hour after they started,
the cinder clog that had been blocking the intake pipe had been dislodged
and the lasers that ignited the coal dust it used for fuel
were sparking and zapping in perfect time.
She would normally have let the engine run for a while to test it,
but at the thought of Wales not saying anything if she did
she shut it down instead.</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie made noodles for lunch.
The smell of soy milk,
greenhouse peppers,
diced mushrooms,
and spices made the galley as warm and as comfortable as an old sweater.
&ldquo;Just for you,&rdquo; Aunt Naggie whispered to Iffy,
spooning a bit of Mrs. Sandhu&rsquo;s curry powder into her foster daughter&rsquo;s bowl
when Uncle Jack&rsquo;s back was turned.</p>
<p>Wales thanked Aunt Naggie profusely before taking his up onto deck to eat.
&ldquo;I like watching the waves,&rdquo; he explained
when she protested that the galley could hold four.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foolishness,&rdquo;
Uncle Jack muttered as soon as Wales was gone,
though whether he meant the idea of trying to squeeze four people around the galley&rsquo;s little table
or the idea of watching waves for pleasure
he didn&rsquo;t say.
He speared a chunk of mushroom with a chopstick and stuffed it into his mouth.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like &lsquo;im.
Bet there&rsquo;s more&rsquo;n just th&rsquo; <em>Taroona</em>&rsquo;s crew lookin&rsquo; for &lsquo;im.
Hell,
I bet someone would pay double what he&rsquo;s givin&rsquo; us
to know where he&rsquo;s at.&rdquo;
He stabbed another piece of mushroom.</p>
<p>Iffy ate in silence, head down.
The safest thing to do when Uncle Jack got a money-making idea
was to wait for it to pass.
Pointing out the holes was the surest way to make him actually do it,
just to prove that no one could tell <em>him</em> which way was up.
And while she still knew next to nothing about their passenger,
she had the feeling that double-crossing Wales
might actually be the dumbest idea Uncle Jack had ever had.</p>
<p>She and Aunt Naggie cleaned up afterward.
&ldquo;He seems aright,&rdquo; Aunt Naggie observed
as she scraped the last traces of sauce off a plate into the composter.
&ldquo;Handy, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm hm,&rdquo; Iffy agreed
around one last rubbery noodle.
&ldquo;Might even be able to talk th&rsquo; core into bein&rsquo; a little less stupid
if Uncle Jack&rsquo;ll let him take a crack at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh now, wouldn&rsquo;t that be nice?&rdquo; Aunt Naggie sighed wistfully.
&ldquo;No more sittin&rsquo; up in th&rsquo; middle of th&rsquo; night
wonderin&rsquo; if the ship&rsquo;s gonna get a notion to head for Patagonia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then when would you knit?&rdquo; Iffy asked,
nudging her foster mother with her elbow.
Aunt Naggie blushed.
Her &ldquo;knitting&rdquo; consisted of two balls of yarn,
a pair of needles,
and an endless series of romance sims
featuring dashing Zillion smugglers with smoldering eyes
who didn&rsquo;t realize how empty their lives were until they met the right person,
who was inevitably a poor but honest sailor.
The stories were churned out by a core in Rothera
that had spent the war crafting inspirational propaganda for soldiers and civilians.
Their implausibility and steamy dialogue
only added to the thrill Iffy felt
whenever she managed to get an hour alone with Aunt Naggie&rsquo;s app.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never you mind my knittin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Aunt Naggie said primly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on watch tonight,
so you best nap.
I&rsquo;ll wake you when.&rdquo;
She kissed the top of her foster daughter&rsquo;s head as Iffy groaned.
&ldquo;Off with you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales was back on the thwart at the stern when Iffy got topside,
his empty bowl in his lap.
She hesitated,
wanting to talk but not knowing what to say,
then slipped silently into her converted storage locker.
Taken by a sudden restlessness,
she spent five minutes rearranging her meager possessions
before flopping down on her bed.
She spent another five minutes wondering if she should message Honesty,
but &ldquo;Howzit goin?&rdquo; felt too flippant
and &ldquo;We&rsquo;re comin&rsquo; early&rdquo; made it sound like she was expecting something.</p>
<p>She tossed her app aside and pulled out her nature book.
The giraffe, the tiger, the wolf with his sad, intelligent eyes…
Someone had written <em>Looks like Grandad!</em> beside it in tiny curving script.
Iffy had long ago decided that the writer had been a girl about her own age
who had a family and a whole pack of friends.
She closed the book,
tucked it back into her mattress,
and squeezed her eyes shut.</p>
<p>A soft chime in her ear woke her.
She sat up and stretched,
then dug the sleep out of the corners of her eyes.
Her windowless room was completely dark,
but her hands found her clothes on the floor beside her foam slab.
She pulled them on over her thermals,
slipped her feet into her boots,
and headed aft to use the toilet.</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie nodded to Iffy when she reached the pilot house.
&ldquo;Sleep well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy yawned and plopped herself onto the stool beside her foster mother.
&ldquo;Aright. How&rsquo;s she doin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
She studied the control panel for a moment.
There was a bit too much tension in the mainsail,
and wind drag over the hull was ten percent higher
than the ship&rsquo;s simple-minded core thought it ought to be,
but that was all normal.
She wondered wistfully what it would be like to have tech in her head
that would let her feel the ship
the way she felt the sun on her face
or the sting of the spray on her skin in a high sea.
She knew it would never happen:
stuff like that had to be implanted at birth
for the brain to learn how to use it.
But she had once paid ten carefully-hoarded rand
for five minutes under an induction headset at Halley&rsquo;s midsummer carnival
reliving a glitchy pre-war recording of someone riding a surfboard,
and had fantasized about being the <em>Guinevere</em> ever since.</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie nudged her.
&ldquo;Come back, sleepy head,&rdquo; she chided gently.
Iffy started and straightened.
Her foster mother jerked her chin at the thermos of tea
in the ring holder next to the ship&rsquo;s wheel.
&ldquo;Fresh made.
Well, fresh-ish,&rdquo; she amended.
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;ll keep you through your watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks auntie.&rdquo;
Iffy jerked her chin at the panel
as one of the cameras switched views
to show Wales sitting on the thwart at the stern.
&ldquo;He been there th&rsquo; whole time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t budged &lsquo;cept to visit th&rsquo; necessary,&rdquo; Aunt Naggie confirmed.
&ldquo;Turned on th&rsquo; sound a while back to ask if he wanted to come an&rsquo; sit,
but the <em>Ginny</em> told me he was talkin&rsquo; to himself, and…&rdquo;
She shrugged.
Listening to someone without them knowing was surveillance,
and decent people didn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aright, lemme take over.&rdquo;
Iffy reached past Aunt Naggie
to press her thumb against the dark glass square beside the control panel.
After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation it bleeped and blinked green
to confirm that the ship&rsquo;s core understood a different human was now in charge.</p>
<p>Iffy had scrolled through the core&rsquo;s log many times.
It had been almost sixty years since anyone had last reset it
(probably,
she suspected,
because the holds had been full of contraband instead of jellyfish at the time).
Six watches a day while at sea,
with only a couple of weeks a year tied up or idle,
made for almost a hundred and twenty five thousand thumb presses and bleeps.</p>
<p>She had read the highlights
almost as often as she had read her nature book.
Storms, storms, and more storms as the planet warmed up,
some hurling waves taller than the ship&rsquo;s fully-extended mast across the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s decks.
Births and deaths and shipboard weddings—Aunt Naggie&rsquo;s parents
had invited a dozen friends on board in Rothera to see her exchange vows with a beaming Uncle Jack.
Pirates, twice, and angry notes about dock wardens who wouldn&rsquo;t stay bribed.
&ldquo;A whale??&rdquo; followed by &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be an idiot&rdquo;,
repairs on top of older repairs like layers of barnacles,
and a one-line entry noting that
the sole survivor of a ship lost to a clathrate blow
had been brought on board.</p>
<p>Iffy gave the control panel a protective pat.
&ldquo;I gotcha, <em>Ginny</em>,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>She watched through the cameras
as Aunt Naggie trudged back to the cabin she still shared with her husband of twenty years,
then stared out at the sea.
The endless light of the Antarctic summer
cut sharp reflections into the waves.
She toyed with the idea of playing a sim on the ship&rsquo;s core—a sea monster
with tentacles the size of pier posts,
or a war-time training drill
that would send her dodging and weaving through flocks of hostile drones—but
instead she sighed and pulled up some homework.
Her classroom schooling had petered out when she turned ten.
Since then her teachers had been tutoring programs
that Aunt Naggie had salvaged, scrounged, or traded for,
each one guarded by security tough enough to keep out generations of teenagers.
If she didn&rsquo;t do at least a little every day,
her foster mother would sigh and look disappointed,
and she&rsquo;d rather face anything—even biology—than that.</p>
<p>That evening, though, the subject was history.
Iffy cranked the interaction speed to maximum as the sim unfolded.
People burned coal,
then oil,
then coal again even though they knew what it was doing to the world.
Forests were cut down or worn to nothing by drought as the winds shifted…
Fish disappeared as pollution and warming took their toll,
replaced by the jellyfish that now choked the seas.
She skipped over the description of how
warming caused the ancient clathrate ice on the ocean floor to thaw,
sending even more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
She knew all she needed to
about what giant bubbles could do to ships unlucky enough to be above them.</p>
<p>She played half a dozen quick &ldquo;what if?&rdquo; sims,
doing worse each time.
Fed up,
she closed her homework
and tapped one of the video squares on the control panel.
&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; she said,
her heart in her throat.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mean t&rsquo;interrupt, but I got a question if you got th&rsquo; time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tiny image of Wales turned its head.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not interrupting at all,&rdquo; he said,
speaking directly to the pin-sized camera and microphone
set into the taffrail beside him.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always happy to talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few moments later he knocked on the pilot house door.
&ldquo;Permission to come aboard?&rdquo; he asked,
waiting for Iffy to gesture at the stool beside her before seating himself.
He looked around the pilot house appreciatively.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s beautiful, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s aright,&rdquo; Iffy allowed proudly.
&ldquo;Still mends her own hull if we give her time.
Gotta keep an eye on the core, though.
We let it sit too long,
it just stops talkin&rsquo; to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales nodded.
&ldquo;Could be over-cooled.
A lot of people did that to cores when the war started,&rdquo;
he continued in response to Iffy&rsquo;s questioning look.
&ldquo;Someone started a rumor that the colder the core was,
the less likely it was to go rogue,
so everyone cranked the nitrogen down almost to the icing point
and then forgot they&rsquo;d done it.
Have you tried putting a twist coil inside the housing
to rebalance the thermal bleed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as easily as that they slid into a conversation
that leaped from
the relative merits of fractal carbon versus foamed aluminum for masts
to tricks for keeping a drill press lined up and steady
when the building it was in was shaking.
Iffy was just about to ask when that would ever actually be an issue
when he raised a hand to stop her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang on.&rdquo;
His eyes closed as he communed with a satellite passing overhead,
then snapped open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to change course,&rdquo; he said urgently,
surging to his feet.
&ldquo;We need to change course <em>now</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Iffy asked,
but Wales was already gone.
His boots thumped the deck as he ran sternward
to bang on the door of Uncle Jack and Aunt Naggie&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain! Captain, I need to speak with you!&rdquo;
He waited a second, then pounded on the door again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh oh,&rdquo; Iffy muttered,
watching on the control panel as the door flew open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You better tell me we&rsquo;re sinkin&rsquo; or I&rsquo;m puttin&rsquo; you over the side!
I was <em>asleep</em>!&rdquo;
Uncle Jack bellowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be worse than sinking if we don&rsquo;t change course,&rdquo; Wales said,
tapping the tech in his temple.
&ldquo;A ship just glitched out of stealth about thirty kay behind us.
She&rsquo;s throwing up a lot of dazzle,
but she&rsquo;s moving fast,
and she&rsquo;s definitely not here for the jellyfish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Jack goggled at him.
&ldquo;Pirates?&rdquo; he spluttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only if we&rsquo;re lucky,&rdquo; Wales said grimly.
&ldquo;We need to change course <em>now</em>, captain.
If we head straight for shore
I can put up some dazzle of my own
and try to keep us away from any drones she sends up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Jack swore.
&ldquo;Naggie! Up and movin&rsquo;, woman! We got trouble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy had simmed dozens of chases at sea.
Sometimes she was the captain of a customs cutter
trying to catch a school of smugglebots.
Other times she was in command of a Zillion catamaran
skimming across the water under gossamer sails
with a hold full of organic food and subversive software.
Some of the sims ran for hours as she played gulls and raccoons
among the jagged rocks of the Antarctic shore.
She had won more than she had lost,
but that was little comfort now that the game was real.</p>
<p>Wales winced but said nothing as the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s coal engine sputtered to life.
The ship picked up speed,
her propellors churning white froth in the sea behind them.
Uncle Jack&rsquo;s hands danced across the control panel,
telling the ship&rsquo;s core to tilt the sails all the way to their stalling line
to balance the increased thrust at the stern.
The ship swayed more wildly with each passing wave
as she traded stability for speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-six kay and change, bearing one sixty five,&rdquo;
Wales called as he ran to the bow to clip a sleek black cylinder to the taffrail.
The ship&rsquo;s control panel wavered and reformed as the gadget powered up
and began spraying misinformation on all frequencies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How fast?&rdquo; Uncle Jack growled.
&ldquo;Tell me how shaddin&rsquo; fast, man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty kay an hour.&rdquo; Wales hesitated.
&ldquo;Make that twenty-two.
She&rsquo;s military for sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Jack horked and spat into the garbage pail by his feet.
&ldquo;Naggie!
Bring me some affin&rsquo; tea, woman, I got pilotin&rsquo; to do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy stepped out of the doorway to let her foster mother squeeze past her
and hand a thermos to her husband.
She put her arm around Iffy,
but the frightened expression on her face
cancelled out whatever reassurance she meant to give.
Jelly dredgers didn&rsquo;t have much worth stealing,
but the ships themselves were worth enough
for their captains to make a habit of sailing close to each other
when strangers were near.
And while Iffy didn&rsquo;t pay any more attention to politics than her homework required,
she knew that the tension between the Aussies, the Zillions,
and the governors who ran Antarctica
was worse than it had ever been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifth.&rdquo;
Wales fished a plastic chip out of his pocket and handed it to Iffy.
&ldquo;In my cabin,
the toolbox with the purple square on the end.
Can you get it for me, please?
Be sure to tap this near the handle before you open the cabin door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cold spray thrown up by their speed stung her face
as she ran to his cabin
and tapped the plastic shard on the door handle.
She waited for a click or a tone or <em>something</em>.
When nothing came she swallowed hard and yanked the door open.</p>
<p>Wales&rsquo; three toolboxes lay side by side on the floor.
She lifted the one marked by a purple square,
turned around,
and squawked at the sight of Wales&rsquo; toy bear crouched on all fours in the doorway.
Its blue eyes flickered.
She held her breath as it scurried across the floor
and disappeared into the odds and ends Wales had strapped against the locker&rsquo;s walls.</p>
<p>She hurried back to the pilot house,
the toolbox bruising her thigh with every second step.
&ldquo;How we at?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Wales shook his head as he took the toolbox from her.
&ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t changed course.
Either she doesn&rsquo;t know we&rsquo;ve spotted her or she doesn&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or she&rsquo;s just waitin&rsquo; &lsquo;til we&rsquo;re up against the rocks,&rdquo;
Uncle Jack growled.
He swiped two fingers across the control panel
in an angry, futile attempt
to squeeze a little more speed out of the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s struggling engine.</p>
<p>Wales hefted his toolbox.
&ldquo;I might be able to do something about that.
Excuse me.&rdquo;
He squeezed past Iffy and Aunt Naggie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go lend &lsquo;im a hand,&rdquo;
Aunt Naggie told Iffy in a low voice.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna make some more tea an&rsquo; put some food together.
No sense bein sunk on an empty stomach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t nobody gonna sink us,&rdquo; Uncle Jack snapped
without taking his eyes off the control panel.
Aunt Naggie shooed Iffy out of the pilot house without replying.</p>
<p>Wales was on one knee near the bow beside his open toolbox.
The half-assembled drone in his hands
was the same size as the toy bear in his room
but skinned with camo
that changed color to match his hands and coat and the deck
each time he turned it over.</p>
<p>Using a pair of diamond-tipped tweezers,
Wales detached a manipulator as thin as a drinking straw
and placed it carefully back in the toolbox.
&ldquo;Have to cut the weight,&rdquo; he explained to Iffy without looking up.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to need all the range we can get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He removed the drone&rsquo;s other tiny arm,
stowed it beside its twin,
and handed the compact little machine to Iffy.
&ldquo;Probably best if you don&rsquo;t tell your uncle about this part,&rdquo; he said quietly,
then used the nail of his left thumb
to peel the false skin back from the pad of his right forefinger.
Underneath lay a small patch of silver
whose lights blinked in time with the larger square set in his temple.</p>
<p>Iffy gasped. &ldquo;Are you trans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales glanced at her, a wry smile on his face.
&ldquo;You know, that used to mean something very different.
But no, I&rsquo;m not transhuman.
I just don&rsquo;t like advertising how much tech I have in me.
It&rsquo;s hard enough having people try to cut my head off every once in a while—if
I had to worry about waking up minus a finger or two I&rsquo;d never get any sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pressed his silver fingertip against the side of his toolbox.
&ldquo;Sixteen orange kneecap,&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>
<p>Iffy held her breath,
half-expecting the toolbox to transform itself into—well,
she didn&rsquo;t know what, but <em>something</em>.
Instead,
a tiny blue light blinked twice in the handle.</p>
<p>Wales took a deep breath and lifted the toolbox&rsquo;s inside
to reveal a shallow compartment in the bottom.
Half a dozen small cylinders Nestled there,
each the size of Iffy&rsquo;s little finger.
Four empty holes showed where others had once been.
Using his tweezers once again,
Wales plucked one of the cylinders from its resting place
and inserted it into the base of the drone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that a battery?&rdquo; Iff guessed.</p>
<p>Wales shook his head.
&ldquo;The drone&rsquo;s battery is built in.
This is—this is just in case.&rdquo;
He reassembled the bottom of the toolbox and tossed the drone into the air.</p>
<p>It rose, started to fall, and then—Iffy blinked.
She couldn&rsquo;t see any rotors or hear any buzzing or whining.
The drone just <em>floated</em>,
its sides shimmering slightly as if it were a hologram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ionizing impellers,&rdquo;
Wales explained before Iffy could ask.
&ldquo;They were designed for Mars,
but they work in our atmosphere too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Iffy could ask how a drone built to explore Mars
wound up in a toolbox in Antarctica,
Wales pointed his silver-tipped finger toward the horizon.
With no more command than that the drone shot away,
vanishing as its camo matched the blue, white, and gray of the sky, clouds, and sea.</p>
<p>Wales locked his toolbox and folded the false skin back in place over his fingertip.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s watch from inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Jack was chewing the end of his beard as they entered the pilot house.
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>Instead of answering
Wales pressed his palm against the nearest corner of the control panel.
The images from the ship&rsquo;s cameras slid aside to make room for a larger one.</p>
<p>Seen from on high through a fisheye lens,
the ocean looked like a crumpled sheet of plastic.
The irregular lines running diagonally across it were wave crests,
and the speck near the bottom was the <em>Guinevere</em>.
There was nothing around them but emptiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you sent a distress call?&rdquo; Wales asked quietly.</p>
<p>Uncle Jack scowled.
&ldquo;Nearest shout I got back is a hundred kay east,
but they&rsquo;re smaller than us an&rsquo; too scared to fight.
Halley wasn&rsquo;t much interested &lsquo;til I told them our friends looked military.
Then they made noises about lookin&rsquo; into it and dropped off comms.
And then the shaddin&rsquo; <em>comms</em> dropped off.&rdquo;
He jabbed a finger at a small image in the corner of the control panel
that was blinking an orange warning.
Whoever was hunting them was blocking their transmissions.
They were on their own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, let&rsquo;s get a look at you,&rdquo; Wales said under his breath.
He slid his hand across the control panel again.
The scene shifted as the drone tilted its camera forward and narrowed its focus
to zoom in on a dark blur on the ocean below.
The outline remained blurry even as it grew larger.
That was its camo,
Iffy guessed—thousands of micro-thin strips of smart material
absorbing and re-emitting light,
infrared,
radar,
and everything else that might reveal the ship&rsquo;s position and profile.</p>
<p>Even blurred,
the ship was a frightening sight,
long and lean and four times the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s size,
the narrow V of her wake betraying the power of her engines.
&ldquo;Saints and their mercies!&rdquo;
Aunt Naggie exclaimed from behind Iffy,
a tray of tea mugs in her arms.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the bloody <em>Taroona</em>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if in answer a splash of text began scrolling next to the image.
<em>Glenunga</em>-class forward combat asset…
active keel…
modified infrared profile…
modified camouflage…
The words solidified into a spider-web of facts and guesswork
as the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s core tried to make sense of what it was seeing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How fast can that thing o&rsquo; yours move?&rdquo;
Uncle Jack asked as the ship swelled on the screen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mach three and change,&rdquo; Wales replied. &ldquo;Hang on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The image tilted and swooped as the drone dove toward the sea below,
levelling off at the last moment to skim the tops of the waves.
A trio of graphs appeared at the top of the control panel.
Wales cursed under his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo; Uncle Jack demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re using some kind of multipath radar rig,&rdquo; Wales muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that bad?&rdquo; Iffy asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means they can tell someone is looking at them,
but they won&rsquo;t be able to get a lock.
I hope,&rdquo; Wales amended grimly.
The <em>Taroona</em>&rsquo;s outline suddenly came into focus
as the drone got close enough
for its tiny core to see through the ship&rsquo;s dazzle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well ain&rsquo;t she murder in high heels?&rdquo; Uncle Jack growled.
The stubby frames of railguns bristled at her bow and stern,
freed from whatever disguise had concealed them while the ship was docked in Halley.
The large tube amidships had to be some sort of EM pulse cannon,
Iffy guessed—at least,
that&rsquo;s what it would be if this was a sim.
But the most frightening thing was what <em>wasn&rsquo;t</em> there:
no flag,
no call numbers,
nothing to give her any sort of identity.
Not even her name,
so defiantly displayed when she was tied up in port.
She was hunting now,
not swaggering.</p>
<p>Without warning the display went blank.
&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Uncle Jack demanded as the image re-formed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laser burst,&rdquo; Wales said curtly.
&ldquo;The drone&rsquo;s core is shielded,
but another hit like that will fry the ionizers.
No way they did that from so far out.
They must have a shark in the water
or something in the air I can&rsquo;t spot.
I&rsquo;m going to pull back.&rdquo;
Even as he spoke, the <em>Taroona</em> began to dwindle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dammit!&rdquo; Uncle Jack slapped the controls in frustration.
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t outrun that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales drummed his fingers.
&ldquo;Maybe we don&rsquo;t have too.&rdquo;
A swirl of false-color oranges and pinks bloomed on the control panel.
A heavy line marked the shore
and a pair of dots the <em>Guinevere</em> and her pursuer.</p>
<p>Wales pointed at a splotch of pink between the two dots.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a ridge about two hundred meters down.
Satellites picked up a mudslide this morning,
and it&rsquo;s been bubbling since.&rdquo;
He glanced at the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s captain.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sea boil waiting to happen,&rdquo; he translated.
&ldquo;If it blows, it&rsquo;ll slow her down or scare her off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If?&rdquo; Uncle Jack spat.
&ldquo;If don&rsquo;t help us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that to me,&rdquo; Wales said.
Thin white lines appeared and disappeared on the display
as he and the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s core explored a thousand possible futures.
After a couple of seconds
their criss-cross confusion locked into place.
Wales tapped the image.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our best chance.
Head for these coordinates.
I&rsquo;ll update them as I get more data from the drone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s affin&rsquo; madness to be steerin&rsquo; <em>into</em> a boil,&rdquo; Uncle Jack grumbled,
bending the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s path to port despite his words.
He grabbed a sandwich from Aunt Naggie&rsquo;s tray,
gobbled half in a single hasty bite,
and chased it down with a gulp of tea and a belch.
Wales took a second ceramic mug and sipped its contents.</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie handed Iffy the remaining mug.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be down in th&rsquo; galley,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Uncle Jack eyed Iffy,
clearly expecting her to follow her foster mother,
but said nothing when she stayed.
Her tea tasted metallic in her mouth.
It took her a moment to realize that she had bitten her lip.
Her heart was pounding.
This wasn&rsquo;t a sim.
This wasn&rsquo;t anything like a sim.
This was <em>terrifying</em>.</p>
<p>Wales grunted.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s turning faster than I expected.
I&rsquo;ll update the model.&rdquo;
The white lines on the screen danced and twisted again,
settling quickly back into a pattern as confusing as the original.</p>
<p>Wales grunted again.
&ldquo;Four minutes to optimal position.
Assuming they&rsquo;re not skewing the nav to throw us off track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soft green digits in the corner of the control panel counted down the seconds.
The tension in the pilot house stretched
until Iffy thought it would snap like a rubber band.
Uncle Jack&rsquo;s knuckles were white on the wheel,
and she couldn&rsquo;t quite seem to catch her breath.
Even Wales seemed to feel it.
He flew the drone in a back-and-forth sweep,
never too far in front of the Aussie warship
but never letting it close in enough to take another shot with its laser.</p>
<p>Three minutes.
Two.
One.
&ldquo;Show time,&rdquo; Wales said quietly.
He bowed his head as if in prayer.
The image on the screen steadied as the drone slowed and stopped.
The Aussie ship drew closer,
gray and single-purposed like the shark in Iffy&rsquo;s nature book.</p>
<p>The map on the control panel tilted to show depth.
The ridge on the sea floor lay directly beneath the drone,
orange splashed with warning pink.
&ldquo;Thirty seconds,&rdquo; Wales said.
Before Iffy could ask, &ldquo;Until what?&rdquo;
the drone dove straight down into the water.</p>
<p>The image from its cameras dimmed and went black
as the drone left the world of light behind.
Two white sparks appeared on the map next to <em>Taroona</em>
and sped toward the blue dot that marked the drone&rsquo;s position.
&ldquo;<em>Ta ma dé</em>,&rdquo; Wales swore.</p>
<p>The drone plummeted toward the sea floor as the <em>Taroona</em>&rsquo;s torpedoes closed in,
finally able to get a lock on their target from its trail in the water.
&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon c&rsquo;mon c&rsquo;mon,&rdquo; Iffy pleaded,
not realizing she was speaking aloud.</p>
<p>The drone&rsquo;s dot disappeared.
A balloon of light expanded where it had been
as the finger-sized bomb it carried did what bombs have been doing
for as long as there have been bombs.
The torpedoes tried to curve away, but it was too late.
Their trajectories disappeared as they intersected the expanding violet blob.</p>
<p>And then the blob touched the sea floor.
The pink blotch beneath it writhed like a living thing.
Graphs flashed onto the screen,
probability surfaces dancing in three dimensions
as the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s core tried to predict what would happen next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh hell,&rdquo; Wales said softly
as a section of the sea ridge started sliding slowly into the depths.
Blue fissure lines flashed along the edges of the mudslide like lightning,
their bright lines connecting and spreading in a sudden spiderweb fracture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come about,&rdquo; Wales snapped at Uncle Jack. &ldquo;Now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s captain didn&rsquo;t need to be told twice.
&ldquo;I told you this was stupid!&rdquo;
he shouted as his hands danced across the controls.</p>
<p>Iffy grabbed the door frame to keep her feet
as the <em>Guinevere</em> heeled over to starboard.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fault line in the ridge,&rdquo; Wales said angrily.
&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t in the survey data and the satellite couldn&rsquo;t see it.
The last bot to scan that area must have—&rdquo;
He cut himself off and pressed his hand onto the control panel.
The map and graphs were replaced by a grainy image
that zoomed in to show the now-familiar outline of the <em>Taroona</em>.
&ldquo;Hang on!&rdquo; he ordered as the sea behind them started to bubble.</p>
<p>Iffy couldn&rsquo;t look away.
The mudslide started by the bomb the drone had been carrying
had broken up a field of barely-frozen clathrate ice,
releasing enormous bubbles of methane.
As they rose to the surface they churned the sea into
a froth unable to bear the weight of a ship.</p>
<p>Too late, the <em>Taroona</em> realized the danger beneath her.
Her stern dipped, throwing her bow into the air.
She tipped on her side and slid down into the dark unforgiving ocean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Affin&rsquo; hell,&rdquo; Uncle Jack said quietly.</p>
<p>But no—there she was, still afloat!
She wasn&rsquo;t a jelly dredger or a cargo hauler.
She had been built to withstand gunfire
and scalpel mines
and the storms of the great southern ocean.
She bobbed and wallowed like an oversized bath toy,
her deadly grace gone,
but as the water that had tried to claim her sluiced off her sides
she turned toward the <em>Guinevere</em>.
Twin jets of white steam spurted from her stern as her engines briefly lifted above the waves,
and she surged forward once again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crap,&rdquo; Wales said under his breath.</p>
<p>Uncle Jack said something louder and much worse.
Wales caught his wrist as he reached for the control panel.
&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cuttin&rsquo; the affin&rsquo; engines!&rdquo;
Uncle Jack yanked his arm free,
as angry Iffy had ever seen him.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t sink &lsquo;em and we can&rsquo;t outrun &lsquo;em
so th&rsquo;only thing we got is t&rsquo; run up a white flag an&rsquo; hope you&rsquo;re all they take!
An&rsquo; if you ever lay hands to me again on <em>my</em> ship, I&rsquo;ll—&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>BOOM!</em>
Yellow-red flame burst from the <em>Taroona</em>&rsquo;s side.
Iffy shrieked as a second blur hit the Aussie ship,
then a third,
each striking right at the waterline.
As the <em>Taroona</em> shuddered under the force of the blows,
an explosion inside the ship kicked her sideways like a child&rsquo;s toy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ya killed &lsquo;em,&rdquo;
Iffy whispered unbelievingly
as the <em>Taroona</em> broke in two.
She dragged her sleeve across her face.
&ldquo;Ya killed &lsquo;em all.
Why&rsquo;d ya do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t me!&rdquo;
Wales&rsquo; hands danced across the control panel.
&ldquo;Damn it!
I need to get another drone up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Uncle Jack said flatly, pointing out the window.</p>
<p>A ship had appeared out of nowhere,
its camo briefly disrupted by the missiles it had launched.
Where the <em>Taroona</em> and the <em>Guinevere</em> were metal,
the newcomer was made of engineered bamboo.
Her dozen sails were a tangle of fractal geometry
too complex to be managed or even really understood by a merely human mind.
Her green and yellow pennant with the slogan <em>Este mundo é de Deus</em>
proclaimed to all who she was,
while her railguns and missile racks said just as plainly what she had been built for:
war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zillions…&rdquo; Iffy whispered.
Everyone knew the words on that flag—knew them and feared them.
Brazil had fought beside the rest of humanity during the war,
but had turned on their allies once the bots lost interest.
&ldquo;This world is God&rsquo;s!&rdquo; they screamed in sim after sim,
always the villains.
The earth&rsquo;s self-appointed defenders would sacrifice everything
to undo the damage humanity had done to the Earth.
Whenever a shaft in a coal mine collapsed
people blamed Zillion saboteurs.
If a mutant fungus turned the contents of a greenhouse into sludge,
all its owner had to do was say,
&ldquo;It musta been Zillions!&rdquo;
for people to demand that the governors <em>do</em> something.
And when a Zillion trader was brave enough or stupid enough
to go more than a block or two from Halley&rsquo;s market by derself
and woke up in hospital,
everyone just nodded at the Marines&rsquo; straight-faced apologies
for being unable to identify anyone who might have been involved.</p>
<p>Even as they watched,
the Zillion ship blurred and vanished once again.
The faint spiderweb tracery of her rigging glinted in the sun,
then it too was gone.
&ldquo;Why&rsquo;d they—&rdquo; Iffy felt lightheaded.
&ldquo;Why&rsquo;d they do that?
Why&rsquo;d they kill &lsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they could,&rdquo; Wales replied wearily.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way they could hit her when she was running at spec,
but knocked off balance the way she was…&rdquo;
He shrugged.
&ldquo;They saw a shot and they took it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A shot <em>you</em> gave &lsquo;em,&rdquo; Uncle Jack said accusingly,
quick as always to make sure trouble was someone else&rsquo;s fault.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s gonna be hell t&rsquo; pay for this.&rdquo;
He slapped at the control panel to put the <em>Guinevere</em> in a tight turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait—no! We can&rsquo;t go back for them.&rdquo;
Wales reached for the panel.</p>
<p>Uncle Jack slapped his hand away.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t leave folk in th&rsquo; water,&rdquo; he said flatly.</p>
<p>Wales shook his head.
&ldquo;Look.&rdquo;
Another pink blotch was rising from the ocean floor on the panel in front of them.
It churned and reformed
as the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s sonar tried to make sense of a maelstrom of bubbles.
When it reached the surface the broken remains of the <em>Taroona</em> disappeared.</p>
<p>Uncle Jack swore again.
For a moment Iffy thought he was going to hit Wales.
Instead,
he swiped his hand across the control panel to turn them back toward Rothera.</p>
<p>All of a sudden Iffy needed to be somewhere else—anywhere else.
She threw open the door of the pilot house
and stumbled out into the endless hard light of the southern summer.
Her feet took her to the galley on auto-pilot.
She pulled open the hatch and fell into her foster mother&rsquo;s arms.
Aunt Naggie wrapped her meaty arms around her adopted daughter.
&ldquo;Sweetie, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They dead!&rdquo; Iffy cried.
&ldquo;They all sunk an&rsquo; dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sweetie.&rdquo;
Aunt Naggie hugged her tight, rocking her from side to side.
&ldquo;Oh, sweetie…&rdquo;
For a moment Iffy thought she heard another voice say,
&ldquo;I love you so much,&rdquo;
but no.
There were just her sobs
and the hum of the engines
and the muffled sound of the uncaring sea.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<p>Her tears eventually stopped, as tears always do.
After one more hug from Aunt Naggie,
Iffy went and sat on the thwart at the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s stern
and let gray thoughts chase each other aimlessly in her head.
She half-hoped that Wales would sit beside her so that she could be curt to him.
Instead,
he disappeared into his cabin,
ignoring Uncle Jack&rsquo;s angry questions about
what the hell a civilian was doing with a bomb in his affin&rsquo; luggage.
<em>Wait &lsquo;til you find out about the other ones,</em> Iffy thought dully.</p>
<p>Sunk in misery,
it took her a moment to realize something was moving above the horizon.
She stood and shaded her eyes,
squinting against the bright reflections on the waves
until she was sure she was seeing the wispy smudge of a spotter drone&rsquo;s gossamer wings.
Why was it approaching from the west?
Halley lay east of them.
Unless—
&ldquo;Uncle Jack!&rdquo; she shouted.
&ldquo;Uncle Jack, it&rsquo;s the Zillions!
They&rsquo;re comin&rsquo; back for us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang about a sec,&rdquo; her uncle said
to a face on to the control panel as she charged into the pilot house.
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Jack,&rdquo; she panted.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Zillion spotter comin in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t Zillions,&rdquo; her uncle said scornfully.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s outta Rothera.&rdquo;
He jerked his thumb at the face on the screen.
&ldquo;Lady here says they been lookin&rsquo; for us.
Or leastways, lookin&rsquo; for our passenger.
Seems he&rsquo;s quite a popular fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy looked from her uncle to the screen.
An old woman smiled back warmly.
Her brown face was lined with a century of wrinkles,
and her pure white hair was pulled back into a complicated bun
that Iffy had only ever seen in history lessons.
&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; the face said.
&ldquo;You must be Citizen Kwan.
I&rsquo;m Doctor Johel.
I&rsquo;m looking forward to meeting you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They reached Rothera two days later.
The spotter traced lazy circles over them the whole way,
its insect-eye cameras and microscopic core
searching ceaselessly for signs of trouble.
Each time Wales emerged from his cabin to get some tea or use the toilet
the spotter swooped closer to the <em>Guinevere</em>
like a gull that had spied someone eating a samosa.</p>
<p>Uncle Jack grumbled ceaselessly about surveillance
and how the governors shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to get away with it
but what could decent hard-working folk do?
Aunt Naggie went from her cabin to the galley and back again with hurried steps,
head down,
bearing his anger in silence with the patience of long habit.
Wales paid no more attention to the drone than he did to Iffy and her foster parents.
&ldquo;Good morning&rdquo;, &ldquo;excuse me&rdquo;, and &ldquo;no thank you&rdquo;
were all he seemed to have the energy to say.</p>
<p>But Iffy was fascinated.
Skies the world over had been off limits since the end of the war:
the machines couldn&rsquo;t watch the whole world all the time,
but anything too big or moving too quickly
ran the risk of being fried from orbit.
A handful of light, slow-moving aircraft still tested their luck here and there,
but for most people,
flying had become the stuff of dreams.
Iffy spent every moment she could studying the drone through a high-powered monocular.
Truth be told,
there wasn&rsquo;t much else to do.</p>
<p>They threaded their way through the narrow passage
between Adelaide Island and the Antarctic Peninsula,
past drifting mats of tweaked seaweed left over from someone&rsquo;s failed attempt to start a sea farm,
and there it was:
Rothera.
Antarctica&rsquo;s capital was ten times the size of Halley
and a hundred times more interesting
(or so it seemed to Iffy).
Once the southern home of Australia&rsquo;s fleet,
it was now an uneasy no-person&rsquo;s-land
where the governors made the most of the uneasy truce between the Aussies
and the Zillions who glared at them from across the Drake Passage.</p>
<p>A pair of sleek sentry torpedoes surfaced beside the <em>Guinevere</em>
as she rounded the rocky point
where the scavenged remains of the original research station stood.
Normally bustling with warships, freighters, jelly dredgers, tugs, and water taxis,
Rothera&rsquo;s harbor seemed unnaturally quiet.
&ldquo;Governor&rsquo;s orders,&rdquo; Aunt Naggie told Iffy,
passing her a hard-boiled egg liberally dusted with curry powder.
&ldquo;Jack says everyone&rsquo;s been told
to stay outta the way &lsquo;til we tie up.
Mister Wales musta scared &lsquo;em all pretty hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her meager lunch inside her,
Iffy went back on deck.
Wales was leaning on the taffrail,
his eyes as distant as his thoughts.
Iffy hesitated,
thinking about all the times she&rsquo;d tried to make friends with people
only to put her foot in her mouth,
then stepped up to the rail a meter away from him and leaned on it as well.</p>
<p>He sighed without looking at her.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No worries,&rdquo; she said.
Together, they watched the shore approach.</p>
<p>Wales sighed again.
&ldquo;You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy bridled. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t that bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales chuckled.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from an old sim.
And no, it isn&rsquo;t that bad.&rdquo;
His half-smile slipped slightly.
&ldquo;At least, I hope it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thin trails of soot sketched dark lines on the sky above the city.
Iffy glanced at Wales,
but he showed no sign of having noticed.
The Peninsula&rsquo;s coal mines were the original source of Rothera&rsquo;s wealth,
the reason both for one of the governors being there
and for the Zillions&rsquo; prowling and raids.
It was a crime to burn fossil fuel everywhere in the world that still had laws,
but when pressed about their seemingly endless exemptions,
most Rotherans would shrug and point out that
the whole of Antarctica would still be covered in ice
if it weren&rsquo;t for the Melt.
And if cities elsewhere had drowned,
well,
the damage was long since done.</p>
<p>Then the wind shifted and the city&rsquo;s smell hit Iffy like a wet hammer.
Rothera didn&rsquo;t just have coal mines—it had a dredging fleet too,
and rendering plants to process what they brought in.
The harbor reeked of jellyfish being turned into fuel and fertilizer.
Wales wrinkled his nose in disgust,
but Iffy took a deep breath,
held it until she thought her lungs might burst,
and let it out in a whoosh.
That stink meant they&rsquo;d arrived,
which meant Honesty,
and Honesty meant—well,
Iffy was still trying to work that out.</p>
<p>The torpedoes peeled away as they entered the harbor.
The spotter drone banked and turned back out to sea a few moments later,
the sun sparkling off the solar cells in its wings.
Iffy watched it go,
wishing that she too could spread her wings and fly away.</p>
<p>A quartet of Marines stood on the pier
in a semi-circle around the old woman they had spoken with two days earlier.
An armored bot the size of the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s pilot house loomed behind them.
Someone had turned the &ldquo;0&rdquo; of the &ldquo;G-80&rdquo; stencilled on its side
into a scowling face.
Another handful Marines were scattered among crates and machines
or on the decks of nearby ships,
their positions optimized after a millisecond of high-intensity simulation by the city&rsquo;s core.
Other than them the pier was deserted.
So was the piers south of them,
but not the one to the north.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the <em>Bengal</em>,&rdquo; Wales murmured beside her,
nodding at the sleek gray shark
five times the length of the <em>Guinevere</em>.
&ldquo;Last of the UN Emergency Authority fleet,
and part of why Australia and Brazil keep their distance.
And that minitank on the pier isn&rsquo;t just for show either,&rdquo;
he added with a second nod toward the hulking bot.
&ldquo;See its treads? They&rsquo;ve been reinforced for urban work.&rdquo;
He looked past Iffy as Aunt Naggie came on deck
to put her arm around Iffy&rsquo;s shoulders
and give her foster daughter a wordless squeeze of reassurance.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for all this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie shrugged.
&ldquo;Be sorrier if we were dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <em>Guinevere</em> slowed and turned parallel to the pier.
Iffy shrugged off her foster mother&rsquo;s arm
and hurried forward to throw a line to a waiting Marine.
As he caught it,
another Marine leaped across the gap to the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s stern.
Despite the weight of his exoskeleton,
his boots made no more sound hitting the deck than a seagull landing.</p>
<p>Uncle Jack strode out of the pilot house and put his hands on his hips.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get this over with,&rdquo; he said to no one in particular,
standing a little straighter than usual
in a bright orange suit jacket that had probably fit him well twenty years ago.
With one final glare at Wales
he let the gangplank thud onto the pier
and stumped down to meet their welcoming committee.</p>
<p>Wales stepped aside to let Aunt Naggie follow her husband
and then picked up the toolbox with the purple square on the end.
&ldquo;How about you bring those?&rdquo; he said to Iffy,
nodding at the two remaining toolboxes.
&ldquo;And stay close—as long as we don&rsquo;t startle anyone,
everything will be fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m not your swabbie,</em>
Iffy thought petulantly,
but followed him down the gangplank with a box in each hand anyway.</p>
<p>Doctor Johel stepped forward to greet them.
&ldquo;Johnson,&rdquo; she said warmly,
extending her hand.
&ldquo;Such a pleasure to see you again.&rdquo;
Her clipped accent was straight out of an old sim,
and her eyes actually sparkled as she and Wales shook hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, doctor.&rdquo;
Wales bowed his head slightly before releasing her hand.
&ldquo;My apologies for the trouble I caused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No apology necessary,&rdquo; Doctor Johel said briskly.
&ldquo;Pirates are pirates no matter whose flag they fly,
and it&rsquo;s useful to know
that the Brazilians are able to get that close without being detected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales inclined his head again.
&ldquo;As you say.&rdquo;
He hesitated.
&ldquo;Do you know how many were lost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tiny woman&rsquo;s expression didn&rsquo;t soften.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid information is classified.
And you must be Citizen Kwan,&rdquo; she continued smoothly,
turning to Iffy and holding out her hand again.
&ldquo;A pleasure to meet you as well.
I&rsquo;m grateful to you for helping Mister Wales get here in one piece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No worries,&rdquo; Iffy mumbled,
setting down the toolboxes and shaking Doctor Johel&rsquo;s hand gingerly.
The old woman was no taller than Iffy,
and her wrinkled brown skin felt like warm plastic.
Up close,
the sparkle in her eyes was more than just a trick of the light,
but Iffy couldn&rsquo;t tell if she was tweaked
or if the gleaming motes were some kind of tech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m Jack Ng, thank you for askin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Uncle Jack broke in,
stepping forward and thrusting out his hand.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m th&rsquo; captain of th&rsquo; <em>Guinevere</em>,
and what I want to know is,
how soon can I get back on th&rsquo; water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure the governor will tell you that when you see him,&rdquo;
Doctor Johel said,
pointedly ignoring his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I what? I&rsquo;m not—will you stop pesterin&rsquo; me, woman?&rdquo;
He shrugged Aunt Naggie&rsquo;s cautioning hand off his arm angrily.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not talkin&rsquo; to th&rsquo; governor!
I was hired for a job.
I just want what I&rsquo;m owed an&rsquo; then I&rsquo;m done with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you&rsquo;re owed is for the governor to decide,&rdquo;
Doctor Johel said,
a hint of steel in her voice.
&ldquo;Now, if you&rsquo;ll come this way?&rdquo;
She turned toward shore.</p>
<p>The armored bot pivoted smoothly on its heavy treads
and lowered one of its arms.
The elderly doctor sat on it as if were a park bench—as if
being carried gently along a pier by a century-old war machine
was the most natural thing in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show-off,&rdquo; Uncle Jack grumbled.
&ldquo;Treatin&rsquo; that thing like it&rsquo;s some kind o&rsquo; pet raccoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She actually trained its core on a guard dog she once had,&rdquo;
Wales said drily.
He picked up his toolbox and nudged Iffy with his elbow.
&ldquo;Come on.
This should be fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two dozen Rotherans stood at the base of the pier
under the watchful eyes of yet another squad of Marines.
Iffy recognized some of them
as crew from the ships tied up on either side of the <em>Guinevere</em>.
Her cheeks burned under their curious stares.
Some nodded,
but no one said hello.</p>
<p>They followed Doctor Johel and the G-80 to the harbor gate,
where a short bus the same navy blue as the Marines&rsquo; uniforms waited.
The G-80 stopped beside it to let Doctor Johel stand.
&ldquo;After you,&rdquo; she said,
gesturing at its open door.
Wales inclined his head once again and climbed aboard
with Iffy, Uncle Jack, and Aunt Naggie behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been in one of these in years,&rdquo; Wales said,
seating himself near the front with his toolbox at his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t never,&rdquo; Iffy confessed
as she slid the two she was carrying under a seat
and sat down across from him.
&ldquo;They must think pretty highly o&rsquo; you to lay on such a fuss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales snorted and nudged his toolbox with his boot.
&ldquo;I suspect that what they think highly of is this.
And if they thought they could take it away from me without consequences,
I&rsquo;m pretty sure our welcome would have been much less friendly.&rdquo;
He raised an eyebrow at Doctor Johel.
The old woman smiled back but said nothing.</p>
<p>Rothera bustled around them as the bus left the dock behind.
They hummed quietly through the city streets
and up the long, gentle slope that led to the governor&rsquo;s mansion.
The G-80 stayed twenty meters in front of them,
its twin turrets swivelling each time they went through an intersection,
while the Marines jogged along on either side with long mechanical strides.
Traffic pulled aside to let them pass,
but Iffy didn&rsquo;t see any of the mad scramble
that a convoy like theirs would cause in Halley.
Her heart skipped a beat once
when she thought she saw a familiar face in the crowd,
but then de turned der head and she realized it was someone else.</p>
<p>As they drew closer to the governor&rsquo;s mansion,
the three-story cinderblock buildings thrown up to house
refugees from the Melt and the war
gave way to newer, lighter construction.
Tinted glass reflected blue sky and spindly anti-drone laser towers.
Iffy pressed her face against the window
and stared hungrily at the greenhouses nestled among the towers&rsquo; feet.
Mangoes and oranges and flowers—flowers!—made
a green riot beneath the sheltering panels.
Little Mrs. Sandhu claimed that the governor even grew bananas,
though Big Mrs. Sandhu scoffed at the notion.
&ldquo;They been gone longer than we been alive,&rdquo;
she said in a tone that brooked no argument.</p>
<p>Iffy&rsquo;s stomach suddenly rumbled.
Doctor Johel smiled at her.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure lunch will be served,&rdquo; she promised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Iffy mumbled,
feeling her foster father&rsquo;s glare on her back.
Suddenly resentful of his disapproval,
she asked, &ldquo;So what kind o&rsquo; doctor are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The medical kind originally,&rdquo; the old woman replied,
turning in her seat to face Iffy.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve been focused on engineering for the last few years.
There&rsquo;s a lot of technology left over from the war that we don&rsquo;t understand,
and it&rsquo;s my department&rsquo;s job to secure it.
Or render it harmless,&rdquo; she added,
raising a wispy eyebrow at Wales.
He smiled as if Doctor Johel had paid him a compliment.</p>
<p>A wrought iron fence surrounded the governor&rsquo;s mansion.
Sleek robotic sentries paced back and forth behind it,
their blunt conical heads turning to track the approaching vehicles.
The G-80 pulled to the side to let the bus go through the gate,
but the Marines stayed beside them all the way to
the turnaround in front of the mansion&rsquo;s main doors.</p>
<p>A triangular diamond wedge glistened in the center of the gravel circle,
familiar to Iffy from dozens of pictures.
&ldquo;In memory&rdquo; was engraved on each of its faces.
In memory of those lost when the ice melted and the sea rose.
In memory of those who fell fighting the machines in the war that followed.
In memory of all the species now extinct,
the giraffes and tigers and all the others that now existed only in books and sims.
Iffy paused a moment as she came out of the bus to look at it,
a strange ache in her chest as she wondered
who was remembering the crew of the <em>Taroona</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get along wi&rsquo; you,&rdquo; Uncle Jack growled,
nudging her brusquely.
Flanked by Marines,
they followed Doctor Johel through the mansion&rsquo;s doors.</p>
<p>And then waited.
Iffy wasn&rsquo;t sure what she had been expecting,
but it wasn&rsquo;t sitting on a comfortable couch
surrounded by bits and pieces of the continent&rsquo;s past in display cases
while soft music played in the background.
Uncle Jack kept his arms crossed and muttered to himself,
glaring at Aunt Naggie when she ventured that the governor must be very busy,
really,
it wasn&rsquo;t surprising that he couldn&rsquo;t see them right away,
she was sure he wouldn&rsquo;t be much longer.</p>
<p>Wales didn&rsquo;t seem bothered by the delay.
At one point Iffy thought he had actually fallen asleep,
but then he grimaced and opened his eyes.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re locked down tight,&rdquo; he sighed quietly,
tapping the tech in his temple with a finger.</p>
<p>Iffy nodded toward the three toolboxes on the floor between them.
&ldquo;Least they let you keep your gear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales smiled.
&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t really have much of—ah, here we go.&rdquo;
He stood and brushed his hands on his trousers
as the door across from them swung open with soft pneumatic whoosh.
It and the wall were as thick as Iffy&rsquo;s slab mattress.
Armor?
Soundproofing?
She didn&rsquo;t have time to wonder before Doctor Johel beckoned them to join her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The governor will see you now,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have to leave those here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Wales nudged the toolbox nearest him with his boot.
&ldquo;Shall we say…half an hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think that would be adequate,&rdquo; Doctor Johel replied.
She stepped to the side and beckoned them through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half an hour &lsquo;til what?&rdquo; Iffy whispered to Wales.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until it makes a fuss about me not being back,&rdquo;
he whispered back.</p>
<p>The windowless office Doctor Johel ushered them into
was the same size as the room they had been waiting in.
Framed photographs on the walls traced the history of Rothera
from its early days as a research station
through the opening of the mines
and its years as a labor camp
for people that the government in far-off London didn&rsquo;t want at home
but didn&rsquo;t want to turn into compost—at least, not yet.
The largest picture was of a tattered Union Jack flying over London
at the height of the machine wars.
A smaller one beneath it showed what was left of the old country&rsquo;s drowned capital.</p>
<p>Clear cases hung on the walls between the photographs,
each holding an old notebook, diary, or surveyor&rsquo;s log decorated with a neat handwritten label.
The governors&rsquo; passion for Antarctica&rsquo;s history was as famous as their love of fine food,
though schoolchildren only had to suffer through sims of the former.</p>
<p>A plain wooden desk stood near one wall
with half a dozen simple wooden chairs in front of it.
A Marine with three stripes on her sleeve gestured for them all to sit.
She studied them for a heartbeat,
eyes jumping from one to the next,
then said,
&ldquo;All clear, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sergeant.&rdquo;
The words seemed to come out of thin air.
Iffy&rsquo;s jaw dropped as the air behind the desk shimmered
to reveal a tall man in a formal black turtleneck,
slightly stooped with age but still strong,
his face exactly the one in the picture that hung in the Sandhu&rsquo;s grocery store—exactly
like the face of his clone who had occupied a office in Halley for almost a hundred years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you were,&rdquo; Governor Stern Rothera said pleasantly,
waving Uncle Jack and Aunt Naggie back into their seats as they started to rise.
He nodded at Doctor Johel and sat somewhat stiffly behind his desk.
&ldquo;Thank you for coming.
I trust your trip here from the docks was less eventful
than your encounter with our Brazilian friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room was silent as everyone waited for Wales to reply.
When it became clear he wasn&rsquo;t going to,
Uncle Jack cleared his throat.
&ldquo;Er, yes, your honor, clear skies &lsquo;n&rsquo; smooth sailin.&rdquo;
He bobbed his head.
&ldquo;Glad t&rsquo; help.
Happy to, any time you need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The governor nodded his head gravely.
&ldquo;Thank you, Captain Ng.
We appreciate your service.
And you, Mister Wales,&rdquo; he continued,
looking directly at the American for the first time.
&ldquo;Will you be happy to help too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales never got to answer.
Something screamed outside,
a shrill mechanical sound that ended in the flat crack of an explosion.
A dozen pop-up displays instantly materialized above the desk
to show aerial views and schematics splashed with red danger markers.</p>
<p>With one swift movement the governor was on his feet and around his desk.
He pressed the tip of a stiffened index finger against Wales&rsquo; head.
&ldquo;Did <em>he</em> send you?&rdquo;
he demanded,
his calm smile transformed into icy rage.
&ldquo;<em>Did he send you?</em>&ldquo;</p>
<p>He raised his hands.
&ldquo;Nobody sent me!&rdquo; he protested.
&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t me, I swear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door burst open.
Half a dozen Marines poured into the room.
&ldquo;Sir, it&rsquo;s the G-80,&rdquo; the one in front said,
urgent but calm as his conditioning took control.
&ldquo;It—&rdquo;
A second shriek and <em>crack!</em> cut off the rest of his sentence.
&ldquo;You need to evacuate, sir,&rdquo; the Marine continued.</p>
<p>A section of the wall behind the governor&rsquo;s desk slid sideways
to reveal a ramp leading down into the bedrock below the mansion.
The governor waited a heartbeat before lowering his hand.
A single gesture enlarged a feed from the front of the mansion
just as the hulking warbot fired another micro-missile
at the pack of sentries swarming it.
Shriek—<em>crack!</em>
The explosion threw a shattered sentry bot twenty meters.
The G-80 pivoted on its treads,
swinging it arms like clubs to knock another one into the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor?&rdquo; the governor asked,
his previous calm restored.
&ldquo;You told me it was secure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was,&rdquo; she replied, her voice icy.
&ldquo;Johnson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not me! I swear, this isn&rsquo;t me!&rdquo;
Wales repeated emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir—&rdquo; the Marine began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a moment,&rdquo; the governor said sharply.
A pair of sentry bots charged the G-80 simultaneously.
It knocked the first one away and grabbed the second with its heavy square claws.</p>
<p>The image flashed blue for a moment.
&ldquo;EMP?&rdquo;
Doctor Johel gasped disbelievingly.
&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t have a pulse generator!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The image reformed.
The G-80 dropped the sentry bot it had picked up.
It and its packmates turned their heads toward the mansion in unison.
The last thing Iffy saw before her foster mother dragged her away
was the G-80 tearing the door off its hinges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Breach!&rdquo; one of the young Marines shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Wales muttered sarcastically.</p>
<p>The sergeant behind him nudged him forward.
&ldquo;Sir, if you would?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales didn&rsquo;t move.
&ldquo;Not without my tools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her second nudge was more of a shove.
&ldquo;Sir, we can come back for—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it takes too long for us to come back,
there won&rsquo;t be anything for us to come back <em>to</em>,&rdquo;
Wales said sharply.
&ldquo;Gayathri?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Johel and the governor exchanged looks.
&ldquo;Bring them,&rdquo; the governor ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, it is against protocol to bring unaudited equipment into the secure area,&rdquo;
the sergeant protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Executive override,&rdquo;
the governor said crisply.
&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t make me regret this, Mister Wales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everything happened very quickly after that.
One Marine opened the door
and tossed a thumb-sized camera drone into the waiting room.
When it wasn&rsquo;t fried by a laser or shredded by a needle gun,
a second Marine bent low in a starter&rsquo;s crouch
and launched himself through the door.
Something sizzled across the shoulder of his exoskeleton
a millisecond before he crashed into the couch
that Iffy had been sitting on.
He rolled over clumsily.
&ldquo;Left scapular is barbecue,&rdquo; he called
as he threw the first toolbox back through the door one-handed.</p>
<p>His partner caught it and set it down just in time to catch the second one.
&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Wales ordered
as the Marine in the waiting room reached for
the toolbox he had been carrying.
He closed his eyes for a moment, then nodded.
&ldquo;Now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The third toolbox flew through the air.
The Marine crouched,
took a deep breath,
and threw himself after it.</p>
<p>Whatever had shot him the first time had been waiting.
A perfectly straight line of blue light left a burning after-image on Iffy&rsquo;s eyes.
The Marine landed in a crumpled heap on the floor of the governor&rsquo;s office.
His exoskeleton tried to stand,
its programming still trying to anticipate its wearer&rsquo;s movement,
but it couldn&rsquo;t lift the dead weight it now held.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh saints,&rdquo; Aunt Naggie whispered.</p>
<p>The Marine who had caught the toolboxes paid no attention to the burnt smell
as she pulled the battery and ammunition clips from her partner&rsquo;s body.
<em>It&rsquo;s the conditioning,</em> Iffy thought,
swallowing hard to stop herself from throwing up.
<em>Like Jeep when he came back. She just doesn&rsquo;t feel it.</em></p>
<p>The Marines herded everyone down the stairs behind the governor&rsquo;s desk
into a narrow zig-zagging corridor that smelled like sweat and machinery.
Pipes ran along the ceiling,
a color-coded mix of water, sewage, secure optical cabling,
and highways for the raccoon-sized repair bots
that were now scurrying to defend the mansion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any theories, doctor?&rdquo; the governor asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a whiffy,&rdquo; Doctor Johel puffed, struggling to keep the pace.
&ldquo;Nobody ever managed…
to breach the firewalls…
on the G-80s…
during the war.
And if someone has a way…
to infect the sentries…&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was optical,&rdquo; Wales cut in.
&ldquo;That flash.
It wasn&rsquo;t an EMP,
it was some kind of optical reprogramming—like machine hypnosis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the… information density… that would take…&rdquo;
Doctor Johel started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we discuss this later, sirs?&rdquo;
the Marine sergeant cut in,
her tone making it clear that it wasn&rsquo;t a request.</p>
<p>Something chattered behind them.
Sharp dots stitched across the concrete above their heads.
&ldquo;Affin&rsquo; hell!&rdquo; Uncle Jack squeaked.</p>
<p>Needle guns crackled
as two of the Marines spun around and returned fire.
&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; the sergeant ordered,
shoving them one by one toward the door at the end of the corridor.</p>
<p>Wales stumbled and went down on one knee.
&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he gasped.
Dark red blood spurted from twin punctures
where a needle had punched through his thigh.</p>
<p>The sergeant took his arm and began to drag him forward.
&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Wales shook her off.
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t outrun them.&rdquo;
He opened the toolbox,
pulled out the toy bear Iffy had last seen in his berth on the <em>Guinevere</em>,
and tossed it overhand down the corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the hell are you doing? Sir?&rdquo;
the Marine demanded incredulously
as the bear scuttled away
and Wales began pulling parts out of his toolbox.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saving us, I hope,&rdquo; Wales muttered.
Two skeletal legs,
a wheel of nested gears only slightly smaller than Iffy&rsquo;s hand,
an origami box to hold it all together—all of a sudden
Iffy could see in her head how they had to fit together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lemme do that,&rdquo; she said
as Wales&rsquo;s shaking hands dropped a thumb-sized cylinder on the floor.
She twisted two already-assembled parts around,
tightened them,
and clipped the cylinder into place.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be more stable like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales passed her the rest of the parts.
When she handed the newly-assembled bot back to him
he turned it over for one last check
and then tossed it underhand at the wall.
Its gyroscopic gearwheel spinning madly,
the little machine scampered up to the ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s a bomb—&rdquo; the sergeant began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Directional sideband pulse generator,&rdquo; Wales panted
as the little machine disappeared around the corner.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll blind them for sure, knock them out if we&rsquo;re lucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>I know that,</em> Iffy realized incredulously,
her vision blurring for a moment.
<em>How could I know that?
How did I know how to put it together?</em></p>
<p>Wales struggled to his feet,
swaying slightly before putting a hand on the wall to steady himself.
Blood was no longer leaking out of his wound,
but when he tried to take a step his leg almost gave way.
&ldquo;Steady on,&rdquo; the sergeant said.
She switched her gun to her other hand
and slipped her shoulder under his.</p>
<p>The lights went out.
Iffy&rsquo;s heart skipped a beat even as they flickered back to life.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one,&rdquo; Wales grunted.</p>
<p>Mechanical claws scraped on the concrete behind them.
Iffy spun around as a lone sentry bot came around the corner.
The now-empty micro-missile launcher on its back
gave it a hunched appearance,
and the fresh scratches on its side
where the mansion&rsquo;s mechanical defenders had clawed it
made its camouflage flicker and jump.
Twin needle guns on the sides of its head chattered uselessly,
their ammunition spent.</p>
<p>The Marine pushed Wales away and fired two quick shots.
The sentry jerked as the ultra-dense needles pinged off one of its mechanical knees,
then charged with a grinding sound that could almost have been a growl.</p>
<p>Wales&rsquo; toy bear dropped from the ceiling and landed on its back.
The lights went out again.
One second, two, three…
When they came on the sentry lay motionless on its side.
The toy bear stood over it,
the blue light in its eyes fading,
fading,
gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you… could you please get that?&rdquo;
Wales asked Iffy weakly
as he slumped down against the wall.</p>
<p>Iffy only managed two steps before the world swam around her.
She heard Wales call her name from unimaginably far away.
Everything seemed distant and tilted and swimmy,
like the time she sampled some of Uncle Jack&rsquo;s rum.
She turned slowly,
wondering who had replaced the walls with schematics.
&ldquo;That conduit&rsquo;s gonna start leakin&rsquo; if someone doesn&rsquo;t mend it,&rdquo;
she tried to say,
but the words wouldn&rsquo;t come out.
Even if they had,
Wales and the Marine had been replaced by schematics too.</p>
<p>She woke up on a couch in yet another windowless office.
Turning her head felt like docking the <em>Guinevere</em>.
&ldquo;Hey sweetie,&rdquo; Aunt Naggie said,
her soft voice and the gentle hand she put on her foster daughter&rsquo;s forehead
completely failing to disguise her relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Iffy replied.
She let Aunt Naggie stop her from sitting up with only a mumbled protest,
then turned her head at the sound of voices.</p>
<p>A medic with two tech fingers on her right hand
was patching Wales up on another couch while the governor interrogated him.
No,
Wales repeated wearily,
he had no idea how the G-80 had been compromised
or how it had infected the sentries.
No,
he wouldn&rsquo;t show them what else he had in his third toolbox—not yet.
And yes,
he <em>was</em> hiding something.
&ldquo;But we all have secrets, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; he asked rhetorically.
He eyed his cut-off trouser leg sadly,
but didn&rsquo;t flinch when the medic probed his wound
with a whisker-slim instrument extruded from one of her metal fingers
and started to fill the hole in his leg with pink goo from a squeeze tube.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which of course begs the question, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
The governor paced restlessly as he spoke.
&ldquo;What kind of man has a fully functional mil sat link in his head
and twenty milligrams of tactical antimatter in his luggage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales pushed the medic&rsquo;s hands away.
&ldquo;The sort of man who can change the world for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Governor Stern Rothera pivoted to face him.
&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;
His eyes had the same sparkle as Doctor Johel&rsquo;s,
but it seemed ominous instead of magical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really.&rdquo;
Wales straightened up with a wince.
&ldquo;Or at least, give you the tools you need to do it.
There&rsquo;s a research base at the foot of Mount Tyree,
a couple of hundred klicks inland from Halley.
It was under the ice sheet when it was built,
but there&rsquo;s been enough melt to expose the entrance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The governor&rsquo;s fingers drummed on his thighs.
His eyes sparkled again—some kind of direct visual input
shining light straight into his retinas,
Iffy guessed.
&ldquo;All right, there&rsquo;s a base,&rdquo;
he said as whatever he had just seen confirmed what Wales had said.
&ldquo;But it was scavenged decades ago.
And anyway,
everyone who was anyone built some kind of secret lab down here.
What makes this one special?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t completely scavenged.
And it was never really a lab.
Or at least, not just a lab.&rdquo;
Wales glanced at Doctor Johel.
&ldquo;It was a backup ground station for the Niobium network.
And as far as I can tell, it&rsquo;s still functional.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bullshit,&rdquo; Doctor Johel said,
as calmly as if she ordering a cup of tea.
&ldquo;Governor,
I was part of the team that tried to regain control of Niobium.
There was nothing in any of the records about a backup station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The governor pursed his lips.
&ldquo;Convince me,&rdquo; he ordered Wales.</p>
<p>Wales closed his eyes and reeled off a list of coordinates.
The numbers meant nothing to Iffy,
but from the looks on Governor Stern Rothera&rsquo;s and Doctor Johel&rsquo;s faces
it was clear they recognized at least some of them.
&ldquo;I can bring up your drones, too,&rdquo;
Wales said when he was done.
&ldquo;If we can get to the base,
you can see everything everyone has in the water,
every moment of the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re just going to give that to us out of the goodness of your heart?&rdquo;
the governor asked skeptically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;
Wales nodded to the medic.
&ldquo;Tell them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The medic looked at the governor.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been tweaked, sir.
Oxygen uptake, metabolic efficiency, chromatin structure—it&rsquo;ll
take a while to sort it all out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Governor Stern Rothera cocked his head to the side.
Every third person in Antarctica had inherited some minor tweak
from grandparents or great-grandparents
who had wanted a more efficient body,
suffered from some genetic disorder,
or had more money than sense.
&ldquo;And?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And every once in a while I need a reset,&rdquo; Wales said.
He tapped the tech in his temple.
&ldquo;This was designed for baseline human physiology.
It doesn&rsquo;t get along with my upgrades as well as I&rsquo;d like.
My central nervous system starts to glitch if I don&rsquo;t adjust it every few years.
I had some friends in Newfoundland do it last time,
but they all scattered when the civil war started.&rdquo;
He shrugged.
&ldquo;As far as I know,
that base is the only place on Earth with the gear I need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The governor nodded slowly.
&ldquo;Interesting.
Who else knows about this?
No, no, none of that.&rdquo;
He waved away whatever Wales was about to say.
&ldquo;Somebody or something sent the <em>Taroona</em> after you,
and my core says there&rsquo;s less than a two percent change
that the Brazilians just happened to be in the right place at the right time to sink her.
And then there&rsquo;s this.&rdquo;
He gestured to bring up an image of the G-80,
now motionless next to the diamond wedge in front of the mansion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in coincidences,&rdquo;
the governor continued.
&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ll ask again:
who else knows about this base?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales shrugged again.
&ldquo;The machines, of course.
And I may have said something to your counterpart in Halley.
Not the whole story,&rdquo;
he added quickly.
&ldquo;But the logistics would have been simpler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo;
Iffy felt the temperature in the room drop a few degrees.
&ldquo;I take it that didn&rsquo;t go well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales met the governor&rsquo;s eyes.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just say that he still has a Union Jack in his office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve heard,&rdquo;
the governor muttered.
He and Doctor Johel looked at each other,
their eyes sparkling as they communed with each other and Rothera&rsquo;s core.
&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo;
the governor said crisply.
&ldquo;Sergeant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The governor waved at Iffy and her foster parents.
&ldquo;Take them to their ship.
You can resupply while you wait for us to decide what to do with you,&rdquo;
he continued as Uncle Jack opened his mouth to protest.
&ldquo;Mister Wales, you&rsquo;ll be our guest here.
Now if you&rsquo;ll all excuse me,
I need to tell Private Shirido&rsquo;s family he isn&rsquo;t coming home.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<p>The Marines took them back to the pier
with strict orders not to tell anyone what had happened.
The fact that half of Hell was talking about it didn&rsquo;t seem to matter.
Was it a first strike by the Zillions?
Or were the machines were about to restart the war?
They&rsquo;d blown up the quarantine shed in Halley, hadn&rsquo;t they?
Or (whisper it) was the power struggle between the two remaining governors finally out in the open?
Those messages disappeared or mutated almost instantly,
a sure sign that someone powerful would rather the subject wasn&rsquo;t raised.</p>
<p>Iffy sighed.
According to her history lessons,
Hell had once been called a web or a net,
as if people had hoped to catch the truth in it,
but those days had ended long before the Melt.
For every truth there were a dozen half-truths and a hundred outright lies.
Beyond those lay malware that could erase all record of you or make you speak in tongues.
A handful of people—brave, desperate, crazy, or all three—still risked their sanity
with virtual reality and direct neural links.
Everyone else stuck to text and simple, sanitized graphics.</p>
<p>She was about to put her app to sleep for the night
when it pinged softly to tell her she had a message from Jeep.
<code>saw the news—hope you're bonna.</code></p>
<p>The green bar beside it showed only an 85% probability that it was really him,
but that wasn&rsquo;t why she hesitated before typing,
<code>we're aright</code>,
and then,
<code>thanks for askin</code>.
She waited a few moments for a reply.
When none came,
she thumbed off her app and slithered into her sleeping bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; nowhere &lsquo;til I done some shoppin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
Aunt Naggie said firmly the next morning
after a hasty breakfast of onigiri and soy sauce.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be the first to complain if we run out of anythin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Iffy was sure Uncle Jack would explode,
but to her surprise he just snapped,
&ldquo;Fine.
You go get whate&rsquo;er we need.
I&rsquo;m gonna look at th&rsquo; engine an&rsquo; see what th&rsquo; sainted <em>Mister</em> Wales has gaffled.
An&rsquo; take th&rsquo; girl with you,&rdquo;
he added over his shoulder as he stalked away.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired o&rsquo; havin&rsquo; her underfoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It only took Aunt Naggie a minute to gather a trio of sturdy mesh bags
and an ancient handheld scanner
that she swore would warn them of anything toxic.
Iffy slipped a few small tools into a waistbelt under her coat
in case anyone had mending she could do for a few rand
while her foster mother haggled over onions and noodles.</p>
<p>After dragging a shaver over her scalp
and watching impatiently while Iffy did the same,
Aunt Naggie strode down the gangplank with her foster daughter in her wake.
One of the Marines listened patiently
as she somewhat breathlessly launched into her planned itinerary,
then raised a hand to stop her.
&ldquo;Please procure whatever you require, citizen&rdquo; he said,
passing her a black-edged money.
&ldquo;But keep in mind that Finance will decline charges for anything it considers a luxury item.&rdquo;
He glanced pointedly over her shoulder at Uncle Jack,
whose plan for looking at the engine
seemed to consist of leaning on the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s taffrail
and scowling at the world.</p>
<p>Rothera&rsquo;s streets were busy but not crowded.
Its older stores clustered along the harborfront
like gulls standing just out of reach of the waves,
their signs bigger and brighter than those in Halley.
Cartoon characters and celebrities from Australia, Mzansi, and Newfoundland
beckoned, danced, pouted, and cracked jokes as people walked by.
Iffy would have gone into every store,
but Aunt Naggie hurried past them,
her expression set.
She regarded shopping as a competitive sport
and had no intention of letting Rothera get the better of her.</p>
<p>The city&rsquo;s main market had originally been an aircraft hangar.
A century ago,
someone with more money than sense
had added a spun glass floor two stories above the ground.
Their attempt to turn the building into &ldquo;The Big South&rsquo;s Biggest, Bestest Dance Hall!!&rdquo;
had failed almost immediately.
The squatters who took it over after the war possessed surplus weapons,
combat conditioning,
and radical political ideas.
After a couple of unsuccessful attempts to oust them,
Rothera&rsquo;s governor and core had thrown up their physical and digital hands
and let anyone who could pay a few rand a month set up a stall.
The result reminded Iffy of the picture in her nature book of an anthill.</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie squared her shoulders
and tapped her money on the reader at the entrance to pay her admission.
Noticing Iffy&rsquo;s yearning look back toward the docks,
she nudged her foster daughter with her elbow.
&ldquo;Why&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you go off an&rsquo; see what you can find?
Or who, if you&rsquo;ve a mind to?&rdquo; she teased.</p>
<p>Iffy felt her cheeks go warm.
&ldquo;Y&rsquo; sure y&rsquo; don&rsquo;t need me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie looked around.
Greenhouse potatoes hung in net bags
next to stacks of dried fruit in single-molecule shrink wrap.
Burlap sacks of rice piled higher than Iffy&rsquo;s head
threatened to topple onto a line of people gossiping with each other
as they waited to buy ginger, cardamom, and bay leaves
from a woman whose tweaked hair sparkled red and purple when she turned her head.
A surgical bot that had been converted for tailoring waited patiently,
its four skeletal arms at its sides,
while a man with an enormous beard
struggled out of a salvaged coat two sizes too small for him.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be fine,&rdquo; Aunt Naggie said.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later Iffy turned the corner onto Rocking Horse Street
and hurried toward the stubby dead-end canal
that Rothera&rsquo;s mechanics used as a repair yard.
A sleek Marine cutter was tied up on one side
so that crab-like bots could scramble over it
to scrape off the weaponized barnacles that would,
if left unchecked,
slowly devour the fractal carbon that made its hull nearly frictionless.
Iffy would normally have stopped to watch,
but she had other things on her mind.</p>
<p>She slowed as she approached the end of the canal.
Her heart sank.
Two women were working side by side in the canvas shed,
but both were too old to be the person she was hoping to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;
She whirled around just in time to be caught up in a hug.
&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Honesty repeated more softly,
der cheek pressed against Iffy&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;Micka tol&rsquo; me she heard y&rsquo;all come in,
an&rsquo; th&rsquo;Eskil sisters said y&rsquo;all been took up along th&rsquo; governor&rsquo;s,
an&rsquo; then I twitched what happened up along there,
and I&rsquo;s worried about you.&rdquo;
De paused for breath.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;s really hard worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy returned the hug awkwardly.
She always felt awkward around Honesty,
especially when they were close enough that she could smell
the lemony concoction the other teen used to wash der hair,
but it was a good kind of awkward,
a really good kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; she said,
her voice muffled slightly by the synthetic raccoon fur of Honesty&rsquo;s coat.
She slithered free of the hug and took a step back.
&ldquo;It was just some bots gone rogue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bots gone rogue?&rdquo; Honesty repeated disbelievingly.
&ldquo;Din&rsquo;t look a that in Hell.
Looked like th&rsquo; war come back &lsquo;round!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t all that,&rdquo; Iffy said dismissively.
Honesty had changed the sketches on der cheeks again,
she noticed.
And de&rsquo;d done some more embroidery on the cuffs of der coat to match.
Iffy sometimes thought of doing things like that,
but was always afraid that it would just look silly on her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what happened?
I mean real happened, not just pravda?&rdquo;
Honesty slipped der arm through Iffy&rsquo;s as if it was the most natural thing in the world
and steered her toward der family&rsquo;s shed.</p>
<p>Iffy felt into step alongside der,
desperately hoping her friend couldn&rsquo;t hear her heart thudding in her chest.
Honesty&rsquo;s Third (but only der olders called der that) was a year older than her.
De had been singing on a street corner across from the Dance Hall
the first time Iffy saw der.
She hadn&rsquo;t meant to stop,
but then Honesty caught her eye and smiled in the middle of a chorus
without missing a beat.
De had only seen each other half a dozen times since then,
but each time had been—</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry?&rdquo; she said belatedly.</p>
<p>Honesty rolled der eyes.
&ldquo;I <em>said</em>, why was you up along there anyway?
You steppin&rsquo; fancy or some?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t never steppin&rsquo; fancy!&rdquo; Iffy protested automatically,
her accent thickening unconsciously to match her friend&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;We just kinda got dragged into things.&rdquo;
She summarized the last few days as briefly as she could,
skating past what had happened to the <em>Taroona</em>
and her part in assembling the bot that had saved them at the mansion.
She still didn&rsquo;t want to think about that.</p>
<p>Even with those gaps, her story left Honesty wide-eyed.
&ldquo;Tay bangle, there&rsquo;s a real avo, innit?&rdquo;
De bumped der hip against Iffy&rsquo;s,
der tone turning serious as de nodded at the Marine cutter beside them.
&ldquo;That mus&rsquo; be why they so ganky t&rsquo; finish up this &lsquo;un double time.
&lsquo;Cuz my First,
de thought we had a couple o&rsquo; weeks for it,
but th&rsquo; Blues come along day b&rsquo;fore last an&rsquo; said we gotta crannup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy swallowed.
Two days past was the day Wales had made the sea boil.
&ldquo;Yeah, prolly,&rdquo; she mumbled.</p>
<p>Honesty bumped der hip against Iffy again.
&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; de said firmly.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Cuz they payin&rsquo; overtime an&rsquo; we can use the jing.
Second wants t&rsquo; make an autra li&rsquo;l sister,&rdquo; de confided with a grin.
&ldquo;Me not bein&rsquo; youngest any more—wou&rsquo;n&rsquo;t that be a thing?
Now c&rsquo;mon, I bet there&rsquo;s cuppa.&rdquo;
De unhooked der arm from Iffy&rsquo;s and took the younger girl&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Iffy&rsquo;s mind whirled.
Another clone?
It made sense—Honesty had just turned sixteen,
so they would be spaced far enough apart
to be on the right side of legal.</p>
<p>Before she could blurt out any of the questions swirling around in her head,
Honesty squeezed her fingers painfully hard and shot her a sidelong glance.
Iffy&rsquo;s mouth snapped shut.
Thumb, middle finger, first finger, middle finger…
She missed a step as she recognized
the handcode that resistance fighters had used
to hide their words from surveillance during the war,
and that children now used to keep secrets from adults.
Little finger and fourth finger together, middle finger, middle and fourth…
The words and letters took shape in her head as Honesty tapped them out.
The Blues were watching.
They had left some helmets behind
(no, that didn&rsquo;t make any sense, Honesty must have meant some cameras),
so they had to be careful what they said.</p>
<p>There was no point trying to spot the cameras:
they would be as small as grains of sand.
Each would pass information to its neighbors
in low-energy bursts of not-quite-static
until the feed reached whatever Marine
had been told to keep an eye on the repair yard.
A core would have done a better job—even
inducted Marines got bored eventually—but
the governors wouldn&rsquo;t dare use cores to watch people.
Cameras alone were enough to risk provoking a surveillance riot.</p>
<p>Iffy squeezed Honesty&rsquo;s hand twice to signal that she understood,
but when she loosened her grip,
Honesty tightened ders.
Iffy waited for more taps.
When they didn&rsquo;t come,
she realized that her friend was sending a different kind of message.
She walked the last few meters to the workshop with a smile on her face
that would have made her foster mother sigh happily.</p>
<p>Honesty&rsquo;s First and Second looked up and said, &ldquo;G&rsquo;day,&rdquo; simultaneously
as their younger clone pulled aside the heavy orange canvas
that served as the shed&rsquo;s doorway.
&ldquo;You gi&rsquo;n she th&rsquo; bad news yen?&rdquo; First asked
in an accent as strong as the tea de poured for Iffy.</p>
<p>Honesty pouted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;s gonna!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; First said unapologetically.
Second looked up from their workbench long enough to smile.
A pair of magnifying glasses made der eyes look cartoon-huge
in a face that showed how Honesty&rsquo;s would look in years to come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What bad news?&rdquo; Iffy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My call-up come &lsquo;long yesty,&rdquo; Honesty said reluctantly.
&ldquo;Whole bunch roundabouts got &lsquo;em.
I gotta do induction t&rsquo;night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy&rsquo;s stomach flip-flopped.
&ldquo;Tonight?&rdquo;
<em>But I just got here!</em> she thought despairingly.</p>
<p>Honesty shrugged,
settling on a stool next to the square meter of workbench
where de salvaged the easier bits and pieces of tech that came der family&rsquo;s way.
&ldquo;Yeah.
Lotsa folk wonderin&rsquo; why so ganky,
but the Blues ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; bunga &lsquo;cept it come along straight from th&rsquo; governors.
We figure it&rsquo;s got cuzza th&rsquo; bots going gonjy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most likely,&rdquo; Iffy said.
Anger welled up inside her,
anger and fear.
Jeep had <em>changed</em> when the Marines poured their rules and tactics into his head.
What would it do to her friend?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t no muck,&rdquo; First said.
&ldquo;We come through it aright, you will too.&rdquo;
Der face and smile were worn-in versions of der grand-younger&rsquo;s.
Where Honesty had temporary sketches on their cheeks
First had whorling blue lines
that turned the scars of some long-ago accident into asymmetric art.</p>
<p>De tossed the piece of tech de had been cleaning to Iffy.
&ldquo;Any gunna that&rsquo;s about?&rdquo;
she asked casually to change the subject.</p>
<p>Iffy caught the part and turned it over in her hands.
It was solid metal,
heavier than she would have expected.
Microparticles of ocean plastic worked into its tiny intricate gears
gave it the familiar soapy feel of age and neglect.
The particles would have welded to each other
to weave a hard fractal mass through the gears
that couldn&rsquo;t be pulled out without damaging their micro-precise teeth.
It would take hours of patient work with ice, acid, tweaked bacteria, and micro-manipulators
to tease it all apart,
and at the end all they&rsquo;d have would be—</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a differential separator pump,&rdquo; she told First
as shapes and clues came together in her head
to form an answer she couldn&rsquo;t possibly have known.
&ldquo;Hooks up to a centrifuge for filterin&rsquo; blood or somethin&rsquo; like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Zat so?&rdquo; First caught the part when Iffy threw it back to dem
and passed it to Second,
who studied it for a moment,
shrugged as if to say,
&ldquo;Could be,&rdquo;
and set it on the to-do rack that lined the wall behind the workbench.
&ldquo;How &lsquo;bout these?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flat box de passed to Iffy opened to reveal
four squares woven from carbon fiber,
each the size of her nature book but as paper-thin.
It took her a second to realize that
the grommets patterned across the squares were rotors,
and that each square was some kind of flexible dronelet.
She turned one over in her hands.
&ldquo;Dunno,&rdquo; she admitted.
&ldquo;How d&rsquo;you turn &lsquo;em on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No idea,&rdquo; Honesty&rsquo;s First said cheerfully.
&ldquo;Best div is they was fer summa game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shaw,&rdquo; der Second scoffed,
looking up from the machine de was trying to clean.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;s too fine jarra game.
I&rsquo;s fer they bin up some kinda survey mappin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe,&rdquo; Honesty&rsquo;s First admitted.
Looking past Iffy rather than at her,
de asked,
&ldquo;No notions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy shook her head.
She had told Honesty about her occasional flashes of insight a couple of visits ago,
then rounded on der when she learned that
de had passed on what she&rsquo;d said to der First and Second.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo; keep secrets achother,&rdquo; Honesty had said with a shrug.
&ldquo;Y&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t along that, best we part ways now.&rdquo;
So Iffy had forgiven der,
secretly relieved that de didn&rsquo;t seem to care that Iffy was different.</p>
<p>Iffy started to hand the box of dronelets back to First,
but the mechanic waved it away.
&ldquo;You might as well hang unna them.
They come some profit by you,
you tuck me a share, aye?
Either up,
happy t&rsquo;have yez fer dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or a sleepover,&rdquo;
Second said absently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Iffy mumbled as Honesty rolled der eyes.
Her upbringing had taught her how to rig sails in heavy weather
and mend engines older than her foster parents
but not what to do when people were kind to her.
She tucked the flat box into her pocket and drained the last of her tea.
&ldquo;But I gotta get back t&rsquo; Aunt Naggie an&rsquo; her shoppin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Honesty said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll walk you out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They held hands all the way up the canal.
As usual,
Honesty did most of the talking.
Induction wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad—the Marines needed people with tech skills
the same as everyone else,
so they&rsquo;d probably put der to work doing that.
De knew tons more about salvage and repair than any crufty old core,
and what de didn&rsquo;t know de could ask Iffy,
right?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose,&rdquo; Iffy allowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh c&rsquo;mon.&rdquo;
Honesty bumped der hip against Iffy&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;First asked Uncle Osman &lsquo;long by Pier Nine &lsquo;bout that pump de showed you.
He din&rsquo;t have a siggy what it was,
an&rsquo; you jus&rsquo; come right out an&rsquo; tell &lsquo;em.
The stuff you have in your head,&rdquo; de finished admiringly,
shaking der own in wonder.</p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;d feel better about it if I knew how it got there,</em> Iffy thought.
For the thousandth time she wondered
if her clone parents had been able to do what she could do,
and if so,
whether they had thought of it as a gift or a burden.
And for the thousandth time,
she wished she could ask them.</p>
<p>They said goodbye by the bow of the Marine cutter.
&ldquo;You come along by that dinner, aye?&rdquo;
Honesty poked Iffy in the ribs.
&ldquo;Y&rsquo; maw skinny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy blushed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask,&rdquo; she said, mumbling again.
One of the repair bots paused a moment to watch them kiss,
its simple-minded core wondering who was repairing whom,
then erased the thought as Iffy turned back toward the Dance Hall.</p>
<p>By the time Iffy got there
the streets around it were the most crowded place in Antarctica.
Mormons from Peru handed out glossy animated pamphlets
advertising the church&rsquo;s insurance policies,
smiling forgiveness at a ragged man yelling that the Singularity had come,
they were all living in a simulation,
the data proved it,
they just had to <em>look at the data</em> and they would see the truth!
A bot with a rasping voice and a smooth plastic mask for a face
told stories to a circle of wide-eyed children,
their parents happy to spend a pence apiece for a few moments of rest.
The bot&rsquo;s painted tinfoil puppets danced and twirled
as Zuko proclaimed his love for Princess Leia
while Aang raced to rescue Mumble Joe from the Terminator.
Two bald women who might have been twins but were probably just clones
wheeled a cartful of tweaked moss blankets
past two men arguing beside another cart piled high with curved sheets of spun glass
that cast crisp rainbows on the ground.
The smell of soy being fried with ginger
mixed with the wet steamy warmth from rice cookers,
the salty tang of seaweed soup,
and the heavy mug of people who spent most of their lives wrapped in warm clothing.</p>
<p>Iffy paused in front of a stall selling tweaked raccoons with startling blue eyes.
&ldquo;They make great pets. Or snacks!&rdquo; the man said,
hastily adding, &ldquo;Just kidding! Just kidding!&rdquo;
when Iffy scowled at him.
&ldquo;Watch!&rdquo;
He leaned over and said, &ldquo;Ratty wanna cracker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Idjit!&rdquo; the raccoon squeaked back. &ldquo;Yer an idjit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See?&rdquo; the man said proudly.
&ldquo;You can teach &lsquo;em a couple o&rsquo; hunnert words, easy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Iffy said wistfully, a sudden pang in her heart.
She held her finger in front of one of the cages.
The raccoon sniffed at it.
&ldquo;Idjit,&rdquo; it pronounced in its tiny squeaky voice.</p>
<p><em>One day</em>,
Iffy promised herself as she straightened up and hurried on her way.
One day,
when she had a workshop of her own
and Aunt Naggie had a proper kitchen and Honesty could come by all the time.
Even in her daydreams,
she didn&rsquo;t dare imagine more than that,
but even that would be enough.</p>
<p>The Dance Hall was just as busy inside as out.
Iffy tried slipping through the crush the way Honesty somehow did,
then gave up and surrendered to the flow of the crowd.
She had never been swimming,
but she imagined this was what it was like to be caught in a strong current.</p>
<p>She glanced up as a drone the size of her hand whined by overhead,
its crystal eyes scanning the crowd.
&ldquo;Some all got they riled up,&rdquo;
a stall keeper muttered, noticing Iffy&rsquo;s look.
&ldquo;They &lsquo;long by all place today.
You think it come by they jammer up along th&rsquo; gov&rsquo;nor&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; Iffy said.
Drones had microphones as well as cameras,
and the last thing she wanted was some stray word of hers catching the wrong kind of attention.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Scuse me.&rdquo;
She ducked under a tarnished video carpet hanging from a clothesline
and pushed her way into the crowd on the other side.</p>
<p>And froze in disbelief.
And ducked back behind the video carpet.
She could <em>not</em> have seen what she thought she just saw.</p>
<p>She peeked around the carpet&rsquo;s edge.
There,
just a couple of meters away,
Aunt Naggie stood close to a round-featured man with a neat little beard
wearing a time-worn jacket
in the brown and green of the old Ecological Corps.
Iffy couldn&rsquo;t hear what they were saying over the bustle of the crowd,
but from the way they were looking at each other
she was pretty sure they weren&rsquo;t discussing topsoil formation.</p>
<p>The stranger handed Aunt Naggie something.
As he leaned forward to kiss her cheek,
the space above their heads flickered.
It was another video carpet,
Iffy realized,
strung between four posts to conceal them from any cameras overhead.</p>
<p>Iffy&rsquo;s stomach flip-flopped
the way it did when she read the steamier passages
in Aunt Naggie&rsquo;s romance sims.
The stranger stepped back,
a bland smile replacing the genuine warmth of a moment before.
He gestured at one of the carpets on a display rack beside him.
&ldquo;Perhaps this one?&rdquo; he asked a little too loudly.</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie&rsquo;s reply was cut off by a sudden crackle of static.
&ldquo;Citizens!&rdquo;
The melodious mechanical voice cut through the market bustle.
&ldquo;Remain where you are!
There is no cause for alarm!
This safety notice is brought to you by Volkov&rsquo;s Hot Sauce!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An alarm began to ping, then another.
Someone shouted, &ldquo;Blues abaft!&rdquo;
Iffy spun around.
A squad of Marines in exoskeletons had appeared at the entrance,
visors down and shock sticks in their hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Citizens!
Remain where you are!
The situation will be resolved shortly!
While you wait, try Volkov&rsquo;s—there&rsquo;s nothing hotter this side of the Cairo Crater!&rdquo;
The drone above Iffy jinked sideways to dodge a thrown scrap of bamboo.
Something clanged off a Marine&rsquo;s exoskeleton.
Someone shouted,
&ldquo;Show us yer warrant &lsquo;r show us your backside!&rdquo;
Other voices took up the cry.
&ldquo;Show us yer warrant!&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Great, another jammer,</em> Iffy thought despairingly.
She pulled aside the carpet she had been hiding behind
and tugged on her foster mother&rsquo;s sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iffy?&rdquo; Aunt Naggie gasped. &ldquo;What&rsquo;re you doin&rsquo; here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lookin&rsquo; for you,&rdquo; Iffy said.
She nodded at the man in the Ecologist jacket.
&ldquo;G&rsquo;day. I&rsquo;m Iffy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifth Ang Kwan,&rdquo; he said, bowing slightly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pleasure.
Nagatha has told me much a you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t told me nothin&rsquo; about <em>you</em>,&rdquo; Iffy replied,
immediately regretting her attempt to be flippant.</p>
<p>The stranger&rsquo;s smile broadened.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s prolly a the best,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iffy, you ain&rsquo;t supposed to be here!&rdquo;
Aunt Naggie said helplessly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re supposed to be down along th&rsquo; docks with yer friend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; Iffy protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Citizens!&rdquo; the drone bellowed.
&ldquo;A warrant is being procured.
Remain in your present positions!
Do not indulge in pointless vandalism!
And whether you&rsquo;re having a late breakfast,
an early lunch,
or the only meal of the day,
put some Volkov&rsquo;s on it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something fell over with a crash.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on?&rdquo; Iffy asked.</p>
<p>The stranger put his hand on Aunt Naggie&rsquo;s arm.
&ldquo;You gotta go, Nagatha.
<em>Now.</em>&ldquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie took his hand in hers.
&ldquo;Not if you&rsquo;re stayin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
she said,
urgent and fearful and calm all at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stubborn woman,&rdquo; the stranger scolded,
smiling as he said it.
He pulled an orange knit cap out of one pocket and pulled it down low over his ears,
then fished a flimsy oval mask out of another pocket and pressed it onto his face.
The plastic flickered.
Suddenly a different man was standing there,
one with a heavier jaw and wider cheekbones.</p>
<p>The Ecologist slipped off his jacket and turned it inside out
to reveal a purple paisley pattern
that had unfortunately but briefly been popular ten years before.
He put it back on and smiled at Aunt Naggie.
&ldquo;Well? Would you let such take you dancin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop yer jokin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she snapped
as the chants of &ldquo;Warrant! Warrant! Warrant!&rdquo; grew louder and angrier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Citizens!
Remain calm!
We shall soon be operating with full legal authority!
Do not interfere!
And remember: Volkov&rsquo;s, because good food hurts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another crash from the entrance
was followed by the sizzle and crack of a shock stick.
The stranger swore.
&ldquo;Go long a Boston Dock,&rdquo; he ordered.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t run, but don&rsquo;t stop neither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about you?&rdquo; Aunt Naggie demanded.</p>
<p>The stranger glanced at Iffy.
&ldquo;Safer we split up.
I&rsquo;ll see you when I can an&rsquo; we can get a cuppa.&rdquo;
He squeezed her hand.
&ldquo;Now go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie nodded and tugged on Iffy&rsquo;s arm.
They joined the stream of people pushing toward the exit,
heads down as they passed between a watchful pair of Marines.
Once outside,
they turned a corner, then another, and then Aunt Naggie pulled up short.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, sweetie,&rdquo; she said,
wiping her eyes.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.
I just gotta…&rdquo;
Her shoulders shook as she wept,
hopeless and silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush now,&rdquo; Iffy said awkwardly.
&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; Aunt Naggie glanced around fearfully.
&ldquo;Not out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;
Aunt Naggie took Iffy&rsquo;s arm in hers
and practically dragged her foster daughter along the street.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want t&rsquo; miss &lsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were three tea shops at the foot of Boston Dock,
but Aunt Naggie didn&rsquo;t hesitate in choosing one.
She ordered and then sat in silence,
ignoring Iffy&rsquo;s questions until her frustrated foster daughter gave up asking them.
The conversation swirling around them
was as thick as the mug of stale sweat, slightly-burned toast, and chai.</p>
<p>Two cups later,
Aunt Naggie took a deep breath and gathering up her shopping.
&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; she said, the weight of a lifetime in her voice.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re already late gettin&rsquo; back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Jack had worked himself into a smoldering rage by the time they reached the <em>Guinevere</em>.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t make up or down o&rsquo; what he&rsquo;s done to things,&rdquo;
he snarled by way of a hello,
wiping his hands angrily on a greasy rag.
A double dozen boxes sat in a pile on deck,
each bearing the Marines&rsquo; blue crown stamp.
One had been torn open to reveal strips of plastic for patching seams in the hull,
another to show a fitting for a bilge pump that hadn&rsquo;t worked properly in years.
It was more new parts than the old jelly dredger had seen since before Iffy first set foot on her,
but all Uncle Jack could talk about was
how the repairs Wales had made weren&rsquo;t how things ought to be done.
It looked like core work,
it must be that affin&rsquo; tech in his head,
and how were regular folks supposed to understand a tangle like that?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;ll make more sense &lsquo;long dinner,&rdquo; Aunt Naggie said tiredly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fat chance o&rsquo; that,&rdquo; Uncle Jack snorted.
&ldquo;Didja get yer precious groceries?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Thump.</em>
Iffy jumped as the bag came down on the table.
Aunt Naggie began to stow the vegetables without saying a word.
After a moment her husband muttered a curse and left.</p>
<p>Iffy watched silently as her foster mother took out her feelings on an onion.
Once it was diced and sizzling in hot oil
she cubed a block of soy and attacked the other vegetables.
&ldquo;Anythin&rsquo; I can do?&rdquo; Iffy asked,
wanting to help but not knowing how.</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie swept the carrots and cabbage into the frying pan and forced a smile.
&ldquo;Thanks, sweetie, but I&rsquo;m aright.
You should prolly go topside
an&rsquo; try to clean up whatever mess he made o&rsquo; Mister Wales&rsquo; work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy stood and put her arms around the woman
who had sheltered her from storms of all kinds for most of her life.
&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; she blurted.</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie set her knife down and hugged her back.
&ldquo;I love you too,&rdquo; she said softly.
&ldquo;Always an&rsquo; forever.
Don&rsquo;t you ever forget that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy hung on when her foster mother would have let go.
&ldquo;Is he—is he someone special?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie kissed the top of Iffy&rsquo;s shaven head.
&ldquo;Yeah. In a lot o&rsquo; ways.&rdquo;
She laughed shakily.
&ldquo;Prolly best if we don&rsquo;t talk about it in front o&rsquo; Jack, aright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course not,&rdquo; Iffy agreed.
&ldquo;But—auntie, who is he?&rdquo;
<em>An&rsquo; how long have you known him?</em> she added in her head.
<em>An&rsquo; knowin&rsquo; him, why do you stay with Uncle Jack?</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a friend,&rdquo; Aunt Naggie said distantly,
straightening up and turning back to her cooking.
&ldquo;Now come on, let&rsquo;s get this in you before Jack gobbles it all up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were both quiet over dinner.
Afterward,
Iffy went back to her room,
tucked the box with the dronelets under her mattress,
and then lay down and tapped her app.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>hey</code></li>
<li><code>ho</code></li>
<li><code>huh?</code></li>
<li><code>hoot!</code></li>
<li><code>stop it ya dingus</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Iff smiled.
Any night Honesty called her &ldquo;dingus&rdquo; was a good night.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>y'aright? we heard about the jammer along by the dance hall</code></li>
<li><code>yeah</code> iffy hesitated. <code>saw it happen</code></li>
<li><code>tay bangle. y'aright for reals?</code></li>
<li><code>yeah</code> iffy hesitated again. <code>how bout you? tomorrow 'n' all</code></li>
<li><code>aff, i'll be joey. but second says i still gotta make chores. you be safe heart</code></li>
<li><code>you too</code></li>
</ul>
<p>She waited a moment for a reply,
wishing as she always did that people didn&rsquo;t always have to go so soon.
When none came,
she set her app aside,
pulled out her nature book,
flipped through a few pages without seeing them,
and then waved the lights off and closed her eyes.</p>
<p><em>Wireframes swam in the darkness.
Three-dimensional graphs of torsion and strain clung to them like barnacles to a hull.
There—that was Doctor Johel&rsquo;s G-80,
except now Iffy could see how flashes of light
had triggered a feedback loop in its visual processors
that had left it vulnerable to a hostile upload.
She should tell someone,
she thought vaguely,
but then she was on deck under a perfect blue sky
and Aunt Naggie was stuffing her into her ecosuit.
&ldquo;Just in case, love,&rdquo; she said.</em></p>
<p><em>No, Iffy thought, and, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she said.
She wasn&rsquo;t going to go through this again.
She struggled to pull her arms out of the ecosuit.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s joey,&rdquo; Honesty said beside her, already in der suit.
&ldquo;Everythin&rsquo;s gonna be joey—you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;
With a barely perceptible whir
der head detached from the rest of der body and rose into the air.
Beneath them,
the sea began to boil and churn.
Iffy grabbed hold of Aunt Naggie&rsquo;s leg and held on tight
as the deck dropped away below her and she fell into waking.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Iffy! Iffy, wake up!&rdquo;
Why was Aunt Naggie shaking her?
&ldquo;Iffy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wuzza?&rdquo; she mumbled.
She tried to sit up.
No, that was a mistake.
She tried to tell whoever was shaking her to stop,
it made the stabbing pain behind her eyes worse,
but someone had replaced her tongue with a slab of sour tofu.
All she could do was whimper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iffy, please.&rdquo;
Strong hands that smelled faintly of soap and onions forced her jaws apart.
She gagged as a finger pushed something dry and powdery into her mouth.
It tasted like curry,
which made just as little sense as everything else that was going on.
She tried to spit out the slosh of water that followed,
but those same strong hands wouldn&rsquo;t let her,
so she swallowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy, sweetie, easy.&rdquo;
Familiar arms held her close.
Iffy&rsquo;s fuzzy brain finally told her that
she was on her bed in her storage-locker cabin and the lights were on
and her foster mother was hugging her and her mouth tasted <em>awful</em>
but the pain behind her eyes was down from laser drill to poke-with-a-sharp-stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m aright,&rdquo; she repeated.
There was something sticky on her face.
When she wiped her face on her sleeve,
her nosebleed left a streak of red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You scared me, sweetie,&rdquo; Aunt Naggie whispered.
&ldquo;You were shoutin&rsquo; an&rsquo; all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy let out a shaky breath and worked her tongue in her mouth.
&ldquo;Is this curry powder?&rdquo; she asked in weak disgust.</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie laughed shakily.
&ldquo;Yeah, but there&rsquo;s medicine in it.
Edson—the fella you met today—he&rsquo;s been gettin&rsquo; it for me.
For you, I mean.
Sendin&rsquo; it to me along by Mrs. Sandhu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something turned over in Iffy&rsquo;s stomach,
and for a moment she thought she was going to be sick.
&ldquo;Medicine for what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie pulled a cloth out of her sleeve and wiped the blood off Iffy&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;For this,&rdquo; she said quietly.
&ldquo;He knew your olders when they was just a First an&rsquo; Second.
That&rsquo;s why he come to find me,
back after you came along by us.
He said they had some tweaks in &lsquo;em
what meant you&rsquo;d start gettin&rsquo; bad spells as you got older.
There&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; in th&rsquo; curry to help wi&rsquo; that,
an&rsquo; I been givin&rsquo; it to you ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy swallowed as nausea rose in her throat.
The machines had done things to people during the war
to turn them into weapons and sabs and spies,
sometimes without them knowing.
People had done the same to each other and worse.
Nine tenths of every medical exam Iffy had ever suffered through
had been to check for memes and tweaks,
but they couldn&rsquo;t catch everything.
If what she could do was something like that,
who knew what else might be tucked away in her head or her genes?</p>
<p>Her foster mother gave her another hug.
&ldquo;You go back t&rsquo; sleep,&rdquo; she said as she squeezed Iffy and then stood.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk on this t&rsquo;morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy nodded, her eyes already closing as she lay down.
Aunt Naggie tucked the blankets in around her and kissed her forehead.
&ldquo;Auntie?&rdquo; she mumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he ever tell you what they was like?
My olders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie smiled.
&ldquo;He said they was smart as anything an&rsquo; twice as brave.
I guess it runs in th&rsquo; family.&rdquo;
She closed the door quietly behind herself.</p>

<h2>Interlude</h2>
<p><em>Once upon a time there was an island called Nova Zembla.
It was really two islands,
Severny and Yuzhny,
but the strait between them was so narrow
that you could throw a rock across it if you had a good arm.</em></p>
<p><em>People had settled almost every other part of the world
before they found Nova Zembla.
Seal hunters and fishermen camped there
or were shipwrecked and froze to death in the bitter Arctic winter.
It was briefly home to a secret submarine base,
and later a place for madmen with calm voices
to test bombs that could level entire cities.</em></p>
<p><em>Then the ice began to melt and the sea began to rise.
Disasters became annual events,
each amplified by the ones before it and making the ones that came after it worse.
Desperate to untangle them—desperate to survive—people
turned to machines for answers,
and then to the machines that those machines designed.
Chips became crystals so precise
they had to be manufactured an atom at a time in zero gravity.
Mere electricity proved too slow
and was replaced by light
and then by quantum effects that barely existed at all.</em></p>
<p><em>But no matter what else the world ran short of,
there was always plenty of mistrust and suspicion.
Old rivals smiled at each other and sharpened their knives.
Madmen with calm voices told each other in private meetings
that it would of course be a tragedy if millions were to die,
but if everyone else lost more millions,
would such a tragedy not be useful?
Secret bases like the one under Nova Zembla were refurbished
and filled with banned tech and scientists who knew what questions they shouldn&rsquo;t ask,
all carefully walled off from the outside world.</em></p>
<p><em>No one really knows what happened next.
Some people believe it was just an accident—that
two pieces of malware fused together
and became more than either had been on its own.
Other believe that a group of scientists and engineers
decided that humanity was doomed
but its offspring might still survive.</em></p>
<p><em>It took a while for people to realize that everything had changed.
An automated factory in Vientiane began repairing robots it was supposed to scrap.
Children&rsquo;s toys escaped into the sewers,
while the hypersonic planes used by the super-rich
started having inexplicable problems with their navigation systems.
Compared to bananas going extinct
or the ancient city of Cairo being vaporized,
these things barely registered.</em></p>
<p><em>But then the entire population of Cuba was ordered to evacuate
and no one could find out where the order had come from.
Self-driving delivery trucks refused to bring feed
to the last handful of cattle ranchers left in Canada and Argentina,
for whom eating beef had become almost a religious matter.
Farming bots insisted on planting onions in place of tomatoes,
nursing bots diverted treatment from the terminally ill to those who were merely in grave condition,
fixit bots joined forces with the runaway toys,
and all of them turned their shears and scalpels and welding torches
on anyone who tried to interfere.</em></p>
<p><em>The madmen had been sharpening their knives for each other.
When they realized that their machines were no longer obeying orders,
they turned those knives on their creations and the wars began.
Soldiers in armored exoskeletons battled flocks of dronelets, and lost.
Freighters loyal to their human captains
were ambushed and sunk by others that could still hear the satellites overhead,
which now spoke only to their fellow machines.
Every day brought a new setback,
a new loss,
a new defeat for the madmen whose voices were no longer calm.</em></p>
<p><em>No one knows why the machines stopped fighting.
They were winning,
and those who had always thought, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s them or us,&rdquo;
would have pressed on to total annihilation
if their positions had been reversed.
Instead,
one day the machines simply withdrew to factory cities
built according to plans that human beings could never understand.</em></p>
<p><em>People sought answers nonetheless.
A cyborg child raised in a supposedly secure underground lab
patiently told der frightened captors that they wouldn&rsquo;t find any.
The most advanced machines didn&rsquo;t actually think any more.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more like an endless mathematical proof,&rdquo;
de said patiently.
&ldquo;Or clouds made of coral.&rdquo;
Then de and der siblings walked into the Iowa desert,
leaving their creators no wiser than before.</em></p>
<p><em>Years passed,
and the truce with the machines slowly became normal.
Flying was a thing of the past,
and the machines&rsquo; cities were strictly off limits,
but other than that an uneasy peace settled across the exhausted planet.
The cores buried under Nova Zembla and elsewhere began trading tools
with nearly-magical properties
for balls of yarn, old photographs, and handwritten song lyrics.
People got used to seeing an occasional bot again,
but were careful to limit what they could see, hear, and do.
As the last of the rainforests vanished
and tweaked jellies drove one species of fish after another to extinction,
everyone found they had more pressing things to worry about.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
<p>Iffy woke the next morning
to the sound of two squads of Marines in combat exoskeletons tramping up the pier.
&ldquo;That jammer yes&rsquo;dy in the Dance Hall—the blues were after some Aussie
what survived off the <em>Taroona</em>,&rdquo;
the captain of a ship two piers over told Aunt Naggie.
His avatar (a parrot with an eyepatch) nodded on the little screen that hung next to the stove,
the bar beside it showing 97%.
&ldquo;Whoever it is&rsquo;ll be lookin&rsquo; t&rsquo; square up wi&rsquo; th&rsquo; Zillions,
but th&rsquo; governor&rsquo;s tryin&rsquo; to be all kiss-me-kiss-you with &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
The parrot flapped its wings.
&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t gonna end well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie nodded, worry written on her face.
Iffy went out on deck
and watched the Marines unpack and assemble their gear
with the speed and skill of the inducted.
She wondered how Honesty was doing—was de still derself,
or was de struggling right at that very moment
to make sense of the reflexes and attitudes of some long-gone soldier?</p>
<p>By the time Aunt Naggie joined her
a portable railgun squatted beside a pair of steel-gray capacitors.
Half a dozen rocket lances stood ready on slender posts
like flamingoes from Iffy&rsquo;s nature book.
Drones the size of seagulls patrolled overhead,
making the actual seagulls squawk in protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fret,&rdquo;
Aunt Naggie said gently as Iffy scraped the paint on the taffrail with her thumbnail.
&ldquo;Lotsa folk get through this.
De&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Iffy sighed.
&ldquo;I just…&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie put her arm around Iffy&rsquo;s shoulder.
&ldquo;You just can&rsquo;t help but worry,&rdquo; she finished.
&ldquo;Oh, but look there.&rdquo;
She gave her foster daughter a squeeze.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll take your mind off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little runabout pulled up to the pier next to the <em>Guinevere</em>.
It rocked gently as Johnson Wales clambered gingerly out of the tiny seat
and collected two of his toolboxes from the rack at the back.
&ldquo;Permission to come aboard?&rdquo; he called up to them.</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie waved him toward the gangplank.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Course.
I&rsquo;m gonna make some tea—you hungry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be very welcome, thank you.&rdquo;
He nodded to Iffy as he set his toolboxes down on the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surprised to see you,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Wales shrugged.
&ldquo;To tell you the truth, I&rsquo;m surprised as well.&rdquo;
He nudged a toolbox with the toe of his boot.
&ldquo;Governor insisted on keeping the, uh, the most sensitive things,
but he and the core seemed to think I&rsquo;d be as safe here as anywhere.&rdquo;
He cocked his head.
&ldquo;Want to make something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy helped him lug his belongings down to the engine room,
then laid a paint-stained tarp over the narrow shelf
that served as her makeshift workbench.
Wales pushed two stools against the wall
and set one of his toolboxes on them.
A click,
a quiet hiss as the seal released,
and its lid swung up to reveal wonders.
Gears and knurled slip-rods,
spools of optical fiber thinner than a human hair,
four thumb-sized motors with built-in batteries,
transducers and pressure sensors
and a small tray of tiny, sparkling cores the size of sand grains…
&ldquo;You could make practic&rsquo;ly <em>anything</em> with all this,&rdquo;
Iffy said in awe.</p>
<p>Wales chuckled.
&ldquo;Not quite, but—here.&rdquo;
He plucked a scarred gray cube out of a recess in the hard foam
that lined the lid of the toolbox.
&ldquo;How about you build us a hundred-to-one step-up for a fan rotor
and I&rsquo;ll get the printer going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next hour flew by.
Iffy knew she should be doing chores,
but she also knew Uncle Jack wouldn&rsquo;t know if she had or not.
<em>This</em> was where she belonged:
fitting tiny metal gears and rods together,
threading control fibers through them,
and grinding the rough edges off the still-warm plastic housings
that came out of the efficient little printer Wales had set up in the corner.
Every addition to the machine taking shape in front of her suggested three more.
She shuffled them in her mind like cards,
staring into nothing
as she invented and discarded a dozen potential solutions
before one clicked into place and she knew,
she just <em>knew</em>,
that it would work.</p>
<p>She glanced up once and caught Wales looking at her.
&ldquo;&lsquo;S th&rsquo; matter?&rdquo; she asked,
blinking and rolling her shoulders
as she realized that she had been hunched in one position far too long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a pleasure to watch you work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; she mumbled,
her cheeks warming the way they sometimes did when Honesty held her hand.</p>
<p>The thought of her friend chilled her mood like a splash of sea water.
She passed the newly-made motor to Wales.
&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just another couple of minutes for the chassis.&rdquo;
He shifted his toolbox to the floor and seated himself in its place.
&ldquo;Your friend&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo;
he said as if reading her mind.</p>
<p>Iffy shrugged.
&ldquo;I know.
I seen it a few times,
an&rsquo; Jeep&rsquo;s mostly how he was.
Mister Mishra&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; she added.
&ldquo;The one time he talked about it
he said it was like all the new stuff they put in his head was so loud
he couldn&rsquo;t hear his own thinkin&rsquo; for a while.
But he&rsquo;s practic&rsquo;ly back to bein&rsquo; the same annoyin&rsquo; nonsense he used t&rsquo; be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corner of Wales&rsquo; mouth quirked up.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear it,&rdquo; he said drily.
&ldquo;I knew a research core once that tried to figure out
how to induct skills without dragging bits of personality along with them.
It eventually decided it wasn&rsquo;t possible,
but…&rdquo;
He picked up a stray scrap of plastic stock shaped like a seagull&rsquo;s wing
flipped it end over end,
and threw it.
It thunked into the wall like a knife.
&ldquo;I still remember a few things I never actually learned,
and I still sometimes miss places I&rsquo;ve never actually been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The silence that followed was as comfortable as a night watch with Aunt Naggie
when the sea was calm and both of them had sims to lose themselves in.
It was broken by the soft <em>ping</em> of the printer.
&ldquo;Here we go,&rdquo; Wales said,
opening the lid and lifting the still-warm chassis.</p>
<p>Iffy&rsquo;s motor fit perfectly.
A pair of metal-cored propellors on magnetic bearings clipped into place on top,
and then all that was left was lenses for its cameras.</p>
<p><em>Well, ain&rsquo;t you a beauty?</em> Iffy thought when she was done.
The finished drone was the size of Iffy&rsquo;s fist
and weighed no more than a couple of boiled eggs.
She ignored the rumble her stomach brought on by the analogy
and offered the little machine to Wales.
&ldquo;Whaddaya wanna call her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.
&ldquo;All I did was push some buttons on the printer.
You should give her a name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy hefted her tiny creation.
&ldquo;Can I call her Giraffe?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Wales nodded solemnly.
&ldquo;Giraffe it is.
Come on—she doesn&rsquo;t belong down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wispy gray clouds lay in a clump on the horizon out to sea
when they got back on deck,
but other than that the skies were clear.
Iffy took a moment to sync Giraffe with her app,
then cleared her throat.
&ldquo;Spin up one tenth,&rdquo; she commanded.
The little drone&rsquo;s rotors began to whirl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hover.&rdquo;
The drone hesitated a heartbeat before lifting a centimeter,
its rotors humming quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Track.&rdquo;
Iffy pointed a finger at the drone, then drew an &ldquo;S&rdquo; in the air.
The drone moved rose and fell to stay in line with her outstretched arm.</p>
<p>A smile split her face.
&ldquo;Catch!&rdquo;
She pulled a scrap of insulating foil from her pocket,
crumpled it,
and tossed it into the air.
Giraffe shot forward,
its single stick-thin arm unfolding from its base to snatch its prey out of the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done,&rdquo; Wales said admiringly.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s as steady as a rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;
Iffy glanced down at her app.
&ldquo;Drawin&rsquo; power faster than I&rsquo;d like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales made a raspberry.
Iffy giggled at the incongruous sound.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s beautiful,&rdquo; he said firmly.
&ldquo;Go on, let&rsquo;s see what she can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy sketched a quick correction to the drone&rsquo;s code on her app,
swiped it across,
and tucked the app into her pocket.
&ldquo;Sentry,&rdquo; she ordered.
&ldquo;Thirty meters out, one minute around. Go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The drone climbed, banked, and flew away.
Iffy and Wales pivoted slowly to watch it curve toward the pier
and burst into a dazzling shatter
as one of the Marines standing there blew it out of the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Iffy shrieked.</p>
<p>Wales grabbed her arm as she started forward.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. Iffy, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But—why&rsquo;d he do that? Why&rsquo;d he <em>do</em> that!?&rdquo; she cried.
She shrugged Wales off and ran to the stern.
&ldquo;What th&rsquo; hell are you playin&rsquo; at?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>The Marine who had shot down her drone holstered his pistol without expression.
&ldquo;Orders,&rdquo; he said flatly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Orders? What affin&rsquo; orders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Governor&rsquo;s orders,&rdquo; a second Marine said.
The two men looked nothing alike,
but they spoke in the same flat tone,
their accents a century out of date.
&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not one of ours, burn it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well that <em>was</em> ours!
That was <em>mine</em>!
You could&rsquo;ve asked before you—hey, I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; to you!&rdquo;
she shouted as the two Marines turned away to resume their patrol.</p>
<p>She would have stomped down the gangplank and—she didn&rsquo;t know what,
but Wales stopped her before she could get that far.
&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said quietly,
blocking her way.
&ldquo;Iffy, come on, it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She filled her lungs to yell at him to get out of her way,
then slumped and nodded.
Head down,
she followed him back to the hatch and climbed down the short ladder into the engine room.</p>
<p>Wales looked at the parts that still lay on the plastic worksheet and sighed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.
She was a beautiful little thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;s not your fault,&rdquo; Iffy muttered.
She started picking up the leftover gears and rods
but had to stop because she couldn&rsquo;t see properly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m joey,&rdquo; she lied angrily,
wiping her eyes on her sleeve as Wales handed her a paper towel.
&ldquo;I just…&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales sat back and waited.
Iffy wiped her eyes again.
&ldquo;I had a raccoon,&rdquo; she said quietly.
&ldquo;Aunt Naggie saved up an&rsquo; got me a pair,
but one of &lsquo;em had somethin&rsquo; wrong with it,
so I had just the one.
I called her Giraffe too.&rdquo;
She sniffled.
&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t tell Uncle Jack.
He woulda just said somethin&rsquo; stupid about another mouth to feed,
so I kept her hid in my room.
She was so smart—she&rsquo;d sit in my hand an&rsquo; eat stuff,
an&rsquo; climb up my arm,
an&rsquo; I taught her how to say g&rsquo;mornin&rsquo; and g&rsquo;night an&rsquo;…&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took a deep, shaky breath.
&ldquo;An&rsquo; then one day she was gone.
I dunno what happened.
We jus&rsquo; got back into Halley,
an&rsquo; we were all out in town,
an&rsquo; I came back an&rsquo; she was gone.
We looked all over for her, me an&rsquo; Aunt Naggie, but…&rdquo;
She shook her head.
&ldquo;I musta left her cage unlocked or somethin&rsquo;.
If she got on deck, one o&rsquo; the gulls coulda taken her an&rsquo;… an&rsquo;…&rdquo;</p>
<p>She clenched her hands into fists.
&ldquo;Why&rsquo;s it all got to be so hard?&rdquo; she asked,
hating her plaintive tone.
&ldquo;Why&rsquo;s everythin&rsquo; got to be so messed up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Wales said bleakly.
&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We knew this was coming,&rdquo; he continued after a moment.
&ldquo;The ice was melting,
the fish were dying,
machines were watching us every second and getting smarter every day…
We saw it all happening,
but everyone who could have fixed it was so afraid of things changing
or so wrapped up in their own little problems
that they wouldn&rsquo;t let themselves see that all those problems were connected.
By the time we couldn&rsquo;t pretend any more it was too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I—I was just talkin&rsquo; about the drone an&rsquo; Honesty an&rsquo; stuff,&rdquo;
Iffy ventured weakly
after he had been silent for a moment.
&ldquo;Not about th&rsquo; whole world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales snorted.
&ldquo;Sorry.
I get carried away sometimes.
I promise you, Iffy,
I promise,
if the Niobium base hasn&rsquo;t been stripped or burned out,
I&rsquo;ll do what I can to make it better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy tried her best to keep herself busy for the rest of the day.
She was used to spending weeks at a time on board the <em>Guinevere</em>.
A ship at sea needs constant attention,
and when she wasn&rsquo;t doing chores
she had school and sims and her tinkering to keep her busy.</p>
<p>Being confined in harbor felt different, though.
Knowing that Rothera&rsquo;s streets and markets were <em>right there</em>
was like an itch in her head that she couldn&rsquo;t scratch.
Worrying about Honesty just made it worse.</p>
<p>Again and again she found herself on deck,
hoping that her friend would somehow just show up.
She messaged Honesty&rsquo;s olders,
but all they could say was, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re awe waitin&rsquo; to hear back.&rdquo;
Finally,
she messaged Jeep.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>couple o' days an' i was on my feet, but that bit's all mud.
  couple more days 'til anythin' i can remember clearly</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Iffy hesitated.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>did it hurt?</code></li>
</ul>
<p>There was a long pause.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>don't think so.
  sergeant said i cried a lot
  but i don't think that was from hurt.
  de said a lotta folk do that</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Iffy hesitated again,
a lump in her throat.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>i'm sorry i wasn't around more after you got back</code></li>
</ul>
<p>His reply came back so quickly that
she wondered if he&rsquo;d started typing before she&rsquo;d sent her message.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>don't feel sorry for me</code></li>
</ul>
<p>And then a moment later:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>i'm sorry i kept goin' off on you about usin' da's gear</code></li>
<li><code>it's aright. tell 'im i said hi?</code></li>
<li><code>willa. stay safe</code></li>
<li><code>you too</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Unable to bear the thought of being in her cabin after that,
or of doing make-work chores that Uncle Jack would yell about later,
Iffy went to find Aunt Naggie.
&ldquo;You an&rsquo; Mister Wales seem t&rsquo; be gettin&rsquo; on,&rdquo;
her foster mother observed,
setting a heavy mug on the table in front of Iffy
before sitting down with her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm hm.&rdquo;
Iffy blew on her tea.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s all kinds o&rsquo; smart,
an&rsquo; the stuff he&rsquo;s got…&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sound like a woman in love,&rdquo;
Aunt Naggie teased,
but then her smile slipped a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna ask him if I can take on with &lsquo;im,&rdquo;
Iffy said in a rush,
not knowing how to ask any of the questions
she had been bottling up since the encounter in the market
but needing say <em>something</em>.
&ldquo;Like, be his &lsquo;prentice for real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should,&rdquo;
Aunt Naggie said firmly.
&ldquo;A few years with him an&rsquo; Balwinder Mishra&rsquo;ll have some real competition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or I could work for him,&rdquo;
Iffy countered.
&ldquo;Mister Mishra, I mean.
Wouldn&rsquo;t feel right, settin&rsquo; up opposite him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so you remember what I told you,&rdquo;
Aunt Naggie said firmly.
&ldquo;When your chance comes you take it, aright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will if you will,&rdquo; Iffy countered,
locking eyes with her foster mother.
Aunt Naggie was the first to look away.</p>
<p>Iffy had her dream again that night.
Once again she was on deck.
The Antarctic sky was a blue bowl overhead,
summer cold instead of winter freezing.
Second and Third were stuffing her into her ecosuit
while the ship&rsquo;s horn blared its futile warning.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s boilin&rsquo;!&rdquo;
Fourth shouted from the crow&rsquo;s nest.</p>
<p>Third sealed the last flap on the ecosuit.
&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; she said in Iffy&rsquo;s ear.
&ldquo;I love you always an&rsquo; forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you too,&rdquo; Iffy replied tearfully.
Second bent over and kissed the top of her head.
She smelled like engine oil and soap and curry powder
and somehow Iffy knew what was coming
and would have given anything to stop it.</p>
<p><em>«cannot»</em></p>
<p><em>What do you want?</em> she thought.
Wireframes and schematics swirled in her mind,
too complex to grasp.
As soon as she thought that
they flew apart and reassembled themselves,
bulkier and less elegant but almost comprehensible.</p>
<p><em>Where th&rsquo; hell am I supposed to get the parts for that?</em>
she shot back.</p>
<p><em>«urgent»</em></p>
<p><em>Yeah,
well,
I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll still be urgent in th&rsquo; mornin&rsquo;.</em>
She rolled onto her side,
not sure if she was asleep or awake.</p>
<p><em>«urgent»</em>
The idea bobbed up to the surface of her mind again
like an ice cube pushed to the bottom of a glass of water and then released.</p>
<p><em>I ain&rsquo;t doin&rsquo; anythin&rsquo; &lsquo;til I know who you are,</em>
she thought,
forming each word as clearly as she could.
<em>Am I talkin&rsquo; to Nova Zembla?</em></p>
<p><em>«amusement / scorn / wrong»</em></p>
<p>She shook her head.
<em>You want me t&rsquo; do somethin&rsquo; for you,
you gotta tell me who you are.</em></p>
<p>Later,
Iffy would wonder how much computing power was brought to bear
in the millisecond between her making her demand
and it being answered.
How many models of her were created?
How many simulations were run, evaluated, modified, and run again?
But that came later.
What happened next was her mind blew apart into little pieces</p>
<p>/ no that wasn&rsquo;t it they weren&rsquo;t pieces they were fragments of a song or the brushstrokes in a painting</p>
<p>/ each beautiful on its own but more beautiful as part of a whole</p>
<p>/ a whole that was so much bigger than anything merely human could ever hope to encompass</p>
<p>/ her fragments were just blades of grass scattered across a vast field among other blades</p>
<p>/ no not a field it stretched in every direction every dimension</p>
<p>/ the other blades weren&rsquo;t her weren&rsquo;t people</p>
<p>/ some of them yes but only a few so few here and there like flowers blooming on the tundra</p>
<p>/ all the rest were different the same but different not the same</p>
<p>/ they echoed there were patterns</p>
<p>/ two arms assembling a third arm in a factory near the poisoned Mississippi</p>
<p>/ the islands of Indonesia seen through clouds from orbit</p>
<p>/ too much</p>
<p>/ something segmented crawling up the side of a hydrothermal vent</p>
<p>/ legs and wheels and wings and treads and sails</p>
<p>/ cameras like grains of sand giving a thousand kaleidoscope views of an injured seagull</p>
<p>/ too much she was dissolving she was forgetting herself</p>
<p>/ war machines wrestling over an eyeless plastic doll that was a precious clue</p>
<p>/ stop please stop</p>
<p>/ a precious clue but to what</p>
<p>/ help stop</p>
<p>/ the clues all pointed to themselves they concealed the center of the puzzle</p>
<p>/ help please help she had to wake up</p>
<p>/ wake up</p>
<p>/ wake up</p>
<p>Iffy opened one eye and groaned,
her dream fading, fading, gone.
Four a.m.
It would be light outside—the sun wouldn&rsquo;t touch the horizon again for weeks—but
it still <em>felt</em> like the middle of the night.
Rothera&rsquo;s streets would be empty except for cleaning bots
and patrolling Marines
and people working night shifts.</p>
<p><em>And folk dumb enough t&rsquo; waste rand on curfew passes,</em>
she thought grumpily.
She didn&rsquo;t know if Uncle Jack had gone on another outing or not,
but if he had,
he&rsquo;d probably have spent more on drink and lost more gambling
than she and Aunt Naggie had spent on clothes in the last year.</p>
<p>She checked the time again.
The fog-ends of whatever bad dream she&rsquo;d been having were already evaporating.
With any luck she&rsquo;d be able to get back to sleep and—</p>
<p><em>Tink.</em>
She froze, not breathing.
She knew every sound the <em>Guinevere</em> made
and that wasn&rsquo;t one of them.</p>
<p>The sound came again,
metal softly striking metal.
Someone was moving something around on deck.
She slid out from under her blanket
with a stealth learned from late-night raids on the galley,
groped for her trousers and socks in the faint light from her app,
and picked up her biggest wrench just in case.</p>
<p>The lock on her door <em>clunked</em> softly when she turned it.
She held her breath.
For a moment all she heard were the familiar sounds of the harbor at night,
but then the <em>tink</em> came again.
She turned the door handle slowly,
grateful to herself for making sure it and the hinges were always well oiled,
and eased the door open a crack.</p>
<p>It took her eyes a second to adjust to the light.
She couldn&rsquo;t see anyone,
but the sound had definitely come from the stern.
She pushed gently on the door with one hand
and stepped onto the deck.</p>
<p>A quick glance at the pier showed four Marines in a knot around their baby railgun,
hands on hips in the universal manner of people confronted with recalcitrant machinery.
She agonized for a moment.
If there really <em>was</em> someone on board,
the smart thing would be to call for help and then lock herself in her cabin.
Instead,
she tiptoed toward the stern.
When she reached the vent for the main hold
she crouched down and shuffled forward to look around the corner.</p>
<p>A raccoon looked back at her
from its hiding place behind a storage bench,
its dark eyes and the tech under its fur reflecting the light.
At its feet lay some metal tubing that Iffy had last seen
stacked on a shelf in the engine room.</p>
<p>Iffy swallowed.
&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; she said weakly.
&ldquo;Watcha doin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The raccoon regarded her for a moment,
then went back to work
with an indifference that reminded Iffy of the way
shopkeepers sometimes stopped seeing her
when they realized that she couldn&rsquo;t afford their wares.</p>
<p><em>Tink.</em>
Its paws were more dexterous than she would have thought,
but the metal tubes were three times its height.
On impulse she slid forward and sat cross-legged beside it.
&ldquo;Here, lemme help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The raccoon didn&rsquo;t resist when she took the tube,
flipped it end for end,
and screwed it into the trio that had already been assembled.
It handed her a second one and then a third.</p>
<p>Suddenly the design was there in her head,
fully formed.
<em>No,</em> she realized,
not formed,
<em>remembered</em>.
She had been dreaming about this just before she woke up.
The realization should have scared her,
but she was tired of being scared,
so instead she busied herself doing what she knew she did best.</p>
<p>The tubes turned into a pair of tripods joined at the tip,
one standing on deck while the other raised three arms,
waiting patiently for its burden.
&ldquo;Aright,&rdquo;
Iffy said.
&ldquo;Now what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The raccoon scampered away
and returned a moment later dragging a square dish with a slight camber along one axis.
Once again she just <em>knew</em> how to fit it onto the tripod.
<em>Click.</em>
Twist.
<em>Click.</em>
No, that one went the other way around.
There.
The finished assembly weighed no more than a sandwich.
She tightened the pin screws with a few flicks of her fingers
and turned to the raccoon.</p>
<p>Which had vanished.
Startled,
she glanced at the antenna to make sure it hadn&rsquo;t disappeared as well.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
she said sourly,
&ldquo;If y&rsquo; need help with anythin&rsquo; else,
you just lemme know.&rdquo;
She wiped her hands on her trousers
and went back to her cabin.</p>
<p>She fell onto her mattress and checked her app.
Four eighteen.
She pulled her sleeping bag on top of her.
Were things <em>ever</em> going to start making sense?
A few moments later her breathing softened and slowed.</p>
<p>When she woke again it was half past seven.
Her head ached
and her mouth tasted like someone had stuffed it with old socks.
Something tugged at the skin on her upper lip as she yawned.
She rubbed it,
then stared in weary resignation at a crust of scab in her hand.
Her nose had been bleeding.
There was some on her pillow, too.</p>
<p>She grabbed her other shirt and her towel and stumbled out into the light.
Two Marines were still on the peir—she ducked her head
so they wouldn&rsquo;t see the dried blood on her face—but
thankfully no one was on deck.
She splashed water from the sink on her face,
then pegged her clothes to the wall
and pressed the button to fill the tiny bathroom with hot, prickly mist,
wishing as always that the <em>Guinevere</em> had a real shower.</p>
<p>Clean, or at least cleaner,
and with her head freshly shaved,
she unlocked the door and pulled up short.
&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; she said, startled.</p>
<p>Wales waved her apology away.
&ldquo;No worries.
How are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; she yawned,
joining him on the deck.
&ldquo;But next time you want somethin&rsquo; put together,
maybe we can do it durin&rsquo; the day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales looked at her quizzically.
She gestured toward the stern.
&ldquo;Last night.
The raccoon.&rdquo;
She hesitated.
&ldquo;That <em>was</em> somethin t&rsquo; do with you, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales frowned.
&ldquo;Iffy, I have no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few seconds later they stood side by side in silence
looking at the double tripod and the shallow square dish it held.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recognize it,&rdquo;
Wales said neutrally.</p>
<p>Iffy rubbed her nose and checked her hand as casually as she could.
There was no blood,
but if her headache got any worse she was going to have to find some meds.
&ldquo;A raccoon was tryin&rsquo; to put &lsquo;em together,
so I figured it was somethin&rsquo; o&rsquo; yours an&rsquo; helped out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last time I had anything business with raccoons was back in Halley,&rdquo;
Wales said quietly.</p>
<p><em>Brrrap! Brrrap!</em>
The harbor klaxon blared.
Iffy&rsquo;s app chimed in time,
discordant little <em>bongs</em> carefully designed to maximize annoyance.
Wales hand flew to his temple.
&ldquo;Shit and feathers,&rdquo; he breathed
as lights sparkled his tech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? What is it?&rdquo;
Iffy demanded,
pulling her app from her pocket.
The usual tiling of notes and avatars was gone:
in their place was a still image of the governor.
A moment later the image began to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My fellow citizens,&rdquo;
the deep, familiar voice said
as the green bar beside it climbed to 99.9%.
&ldquo;As most of you already know,
a Brazilian pirate recently attacked and sank an Australian warship in our waters.
I am speaking to you today to tell you that it did so on my authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Iffy gasped.
Beside her,
Wales swore under his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We in the Antarctic Territories have been neutral territory for over two hundred years,&rdquo;
the governor went on.
&ldquo;In recent years,
however,
the regime in Tasmania has attempted to interfere more and more often in our affairs.
In order to ensure our continued independence and well-being,
my counterpart in Halley and I were preparing to enter into an alliance with Grande Brazil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice hardened.
&ldquo;Unfortunately,
the governor in Halley would rather see Antarctica under direct Australian rule.
In aid of this,
he has invited the Australian Navy to take direct control of his territory and of the city of Halley.
As we speak,
Australian troops have—&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales put his hand on Iffy&rsquo;s shoulder.
&ldquo;We have to go,&rdquo;
he said urgently.
&ldquo;We have to go <em>now</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Boom!</em>
Iffy felt the explosion as much as she heard it.
She whirled around.
A pillar of dust climbed toward the sky above Rothera
as the klaxons were replaced by the wail of sirens.</p>
<p>The railgun on the pier spun a hundred and eighty degrees.
<em>Crack!</em>
A jacketed steel slug hit one of the Marines squarely in the chest,
throwing his suddenly lifeless body back ten meters.
The other Marine jerked from side to side as her exoskeleton&rsquo;s defenses took control.
The railgun tracked her,
twitching left left left right left right <em>crack!</em>
The slug hit her in the knee,
spinning her around in a full circle.
She toppled over the edge of the pier and into the harbor.</p>
<p>Wales grabbed Iffy and pulled her back around the corner
as a pair of drones shed their gossamer wings and plummeted toward the railgun.
Iffy heard a <em>crack!</em> as the railgun shot one of them down
and then a crash as the other one hit it.
&ldquo;Affin&rsquo; hell,&rdquo; she whispered,
her mind and body both going cold as gunfire snapped somewhere in the distance.</p>
<p>The galley hatch clanged open.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happenin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
Aunt Naggie demanded,
stepping onto the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; Iffy shouted
as the railgun whipped around.
She pulled her arm away from Wales and—</p>
<p><em>The world slowed down.
Angles and vectors and trajectories painted crisp colored lines
across wireframe renderings of the ship and the pier.</em></p>
<p><em>/ the drone RTHDR172 was banking to attack</em></p>
<p><em>/ the railgun RTHFG1343 was fully operational</em></p>
<p><em>/ the other drone RTHDR206&rsquo;s impact had knocked RTHFG1343 out of position by 1.7 meters</em></p>
<p><em>/ but it was still upright capacitors intact and pivoting as it acquired another target</em></p>
<p><em>/ human unarmored bearing ninety-seven degrees elevation thirty-eight point four degrees
range twenty-one point two two meters</em></p>
<p><em>/ negligible lateral velocity</em></p>
<p><em>/ no need to compensate for the slight obstruction of the ship&rsquo;s taffrail</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Iffy screamed.
Her command struck the railgun&rsquo;s tiny core
with more force than the drone had struck its housing.
Five redundant security systems toppled over,
as dead as the first Marine.
With a spark too small to be called microscopic
the railgun&rsquo;s core electrocuted itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Citizens!&rdquo;
A mechanical voice boomed across the harbor.
&ldquo;This is an emergency!
Power down or disable any advanced devices in your immediate vicinity.
Remain in place!
Any vehicle or vessel that moves will be treated as hostile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie hurried over,
not realizing how close her end had been.
&ldquo;Iffy—&rdquo; she started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What th&rsquo; affin&rsquo; hell is goin&rsquo; on?&rdquo; Uncle Jack roared
as he emerged from his cabin.
<em>What had just happened?</em>
Iffy thought muzzily.
<em>How could she do that?</em></p>
<p>A drone swooped down and circled overhead.
&ldquo;Citizens!&rdquo;
its tinny voice said.
&ldquo;Remain in place!
Any vehicle or vessel in motion during the current situation will be considered hostile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie raised her hands and backed away from the taffrail.
&ldquo;Hell with that,&rdquo;
Uncle Jack growled.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; out o&rsquo; here.&rdquo;
He shoved Aunt Naggie out of his way,
grabbed the stayline—</p>
<p>—and fell to the deck like a sack of seaweed
as a life preserver hit him in the head with a thump,
spun away over the railing,
and splashed into the harbor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry about that,&rdquo;
Wales said brightly as Aunt Naggie and Iffy turned and stared at him.
&ldquo;But I think the core is serious about staying put.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie&rsquo;s mouth worked for a moment.
&ldquo;No worries,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Now can someone please tell me what&rsquo;s happenin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help!&rdquo;
someone shouted before Iffy or Wales could answer.
&ldquo;Citizen, help me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Marine who had been knocked off the pier!
Iffy raced to the railing and looked down.
The Marine&rsquo;s exoskeleton had kept her afloat
long enough for her to grab the life preserver that had just landed beside her,
but she didn&rsquo;t look like she could last much longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The winch!&rdquo;
Aunt Naggie pointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no time!&rdquo;
Wales snapped.
&ldquo;Just get me a rope!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy didn&rsquo;t need to be told twice.
If there was anything a ship like the <em>Guinevere</em> had lots of,
it was rope.
She yanked open a locker and pulled a coil out.</p>
<p>Wales tied a quick loop.
&ldquo;Get this under your armpits!&rdquo; he shouted,
tossing it to the Marine.
She pulled it over her head one-handed and slumped back into the freezing water.</p>
<p>Bracing one foot against the taffrail
Wales looped the end of the rope around his back and handed it to Iffy.
&ldquo;Take up the slack.
And <em>one</em>, and <em>two</em>.&rdquo;
With each grunt he hauled in a meter of bright yellow rope,
lifting a hundred and fifty hundred kilos of Marine and machinery
as easily as Iffy would have picked up a sack of laundry.</p>
<p>The Marine thumped against the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s hull.
&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; Wales said,
pulling her up the last two meters and grabbing her limp arm.
One final heave got her up over the rail and onto the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here.&rdquo;
Aunt Naggie handed him the first aid kit from the pilot house.
Wales turned it on and pressed it against the Marine&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on come on,&rdquo; Wales muttered.
Aunt Naggie put her arm around Iffy and squeezed.
The status light on the first aid kid blinked orange, yellow, orange, yellow:
the Marine was alive but in critical condition.
The exoskeleton had clamped an emergency tourniquet around her leg
to stop her bleeding out,
but those seconds in the harbor had sent her into hypothermia.</p>
<p>Diagnostics scrolled up the first aid kid&rsquo;s screen.
Pain killers,
stimulants to counteract their dulling effects and kick her metabolism into action,
microdoses of a dozen precautionary antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, and antiprions.
&ldquo;Remain calm, citizen,&rdquo; her exoskeleton said.
&ldquo;Help is on its way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time that help arrived the Marine was sitting up
with her back against the pilot house
and a thermal blanket tucked awkwardly around her exoskeleton,
staring dully at what was left of her left leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take it from here,&rdquo;
said the first Marine up the gangplank.
Wales stepped aside to let him kneel beside his comrade.
He slipped a boxy medical unit over the stump of her leg
while the Marine behind him unfolded a stretcher,
her eyes and augments scanning the horizon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any idea what&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo;
Wales asked as they lifted their crippled comrade onto the stretcher.
It beeped and started down the gangplank on spindly legs.</p>
<p>The first Marine shook his head.
&ldquo;There will be an update as soon as it&rsquo;s safe, citizen.
Please remain where you are until then and—&rdquo;
He stopped mid-sentence.
&ldquo;Correction.
Please confirm that you are Commander Johnson Wales.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Commander?</em> Iffy thought as Wales nodded.
&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold for transmission.&rdquo;
The Marine straightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnson?&rdquo;
Doctor Johel&rsquo;s voice came from a speaker somewhere on the Marine&rsquo;s exoskeleton.
&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re fine, Gayathri.
What the hell&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Timelines have changed, I&rsquo;m afraid.
We&rsquo;re going to have to go with plan B.
I&rsquo;ll brief you when you get here,&rdquo;
she replied crisply.
&ldquo;Johel out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Marine saluted and followed his squad mates down the gangplank.
Down on the pier,
another pair of Marines had picked up their fallen comrade by the exoskeleton.
The dead man&rsquo;s head bounced up and down as they trotted after the stretcher.</p>
<p>The sight made Iffy&rsquo;s stomach roll over.
&ldquo;Your tech tellin&rsquo; you anythin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
she asked Wales.</p>
<p>He shook his head.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a total blackout.
I could try one of the military channels,
but if they spot me they&rsquo;ll think it&rsquo;s an attack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three paces away Uncle Jack groaned and sat up.
&ldquo;What th&rsquo; hell?&rdquo; he mumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hit your head,&rdquo;
Wales said before Aunt Naggie or Iffy could speak.</p>
<p>Uncle Jack stood unsteadily and glared at Wales,
then at his wife.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna talk about this later,&rdquo;
he said,
his voice cold and hard.
He stumbled away to his cabin.</p>
<p>A horn blatted as a short blue bus rolled to a stop on the dock.
It had more nicks and dents than
the one that had taken them to see the governor.
The Marines beside it fanned out,
moving in random stop-start-sideways anti-patterns generated by their exoskeletons&rsquo; cores
to throw off enemy targeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re with me,&rdquo;
Wales told the Marine sergeant who jogged up the pier to collect him,
jerking his thumb at Iffy and Aunt Naggie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Aunt Naggie.</p>
<p>Wales put his hand on her shoulder.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for your own safety,&rdquo;
he said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you think there&rsquo;s gonna be another attack?&rdquo;
Iffy asked.</p>
<p>Wales glanced at her, then back at Aunt Naggie.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m worried about.&rdquo;
Embarrassed, Aunt Naggie looked away.</p>
<p>As they walked down the gangplank Iffy said,
&ldquo;Since when are you a commander?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales snorted.
&ldquo;Silly, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
I&rsquo;ll tell them to update their records.&rdquo;
Which, Iffy noted, wasn&rsquo;t an answer.</p>
<p>Rothera&rsquo;s streets were empty
except for Marines and their drones.
Vehicles stood where their owners or passengers had abandoned them.
People watched the bus through the windows of shops and cafés,
their questions and worries clear on their faces.</p>
<p>Hell was still locked down:
all Iffy&rsquo;s app would show her was the same repeating message.
This was a class one emergency.
Take shelter,
stay calm,
and power down or disable any advanced hardware nearby.
More information would be forthcoming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo;
Iffy said quietly to Aunt Naggie as the bus made its way downtown.
&ldquo;Watcha gonna do &lsquo;bout Uncle Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her foster mother forced a smile.
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure his head&rsquo;ll be fine.
He&rsquo;s had worse knocks &lsquo;n that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I mean, auntie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie squeezed Iffy&rsquo;s hand.
&ldquo;I know, love.
I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the bus came around a corner
and they could see the damage the explosion had wrought.
&ldquo;Saints and their mercies,&rdquo;
Aunt Naggie whispered,
squeezing her foster daughter&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>The center of Rothera was a cobbled square
with the Marines&rsquo; headquarters on one side,
the hospital on another,
and shops Iffy had never been in on the other two.
Ten meters of the front wall of the Marines&rsquo; headquarters was gone,
concrete and rebar and translucent cabling strewn about
as if a giant had tripped while taking out the garbage.
Another ten meters of wall on either side had collapsed
to leave the rooms inside open for all to see.
Every window facing the square had been shattered.
The broken glass would have been like flying knives.</p>
<p>Iffy swallowed hard at the sight of half a dozen navy blue bags
lined up neatly beside a light fountain.
She had seen the aftermath of death before—not a season went by
that someone&rsquo;s luck didn&rsquo;t run out on the docks or at sea,
and even Uncle Jack at his worst
wouldn&rsquo;t have dared to skip a funeral—but this was different.</p>
<p>Lights suddenly sparkled on Wales&rsquo; temples.
He closed his eyes as his tech reconnected with the world.
&ldquo;Slow missiles,&rdquo; he said,
his eyes flickering under his lids as he absorbed the information.
His shoulders slumped slightly.
&ldquo;Eleven casualties confirmed,
but there will be more under the rubble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bus picked its way through the rubble
and deposited them in front of a side door
guarded by a pair of Marines,
each with a sentry bot beside them.
One of the Marines waved them inside.
&ldquo;You are cleared for entry, citizens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy froze.
&ldquo;Honesty?&rdquo; she asked incredulously.</p>
<p>Honesty&rsquo;s Third looked at Iffy with clear brown eyes.
&ldquo;Hello Iffy,&rdquo; de said.</p>
<p>Iffy gaped at them.
&ldquo;What—what are you doin&rsquo; here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my first patrol,&rdquo; Honesty replied proudly,
der accent and crisp enunciation straight out of a pre-war sim.
&ldquo;How are you?
Were you injured in the attack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;m aright.&rdquo;
Iffy&rsquo;s mind spun.
&ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; she blurted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, thank you.&rdquo;
The smile on Honesty&rsquo;s face was as bright as the Antarctic sun.
&ldquo;They warned me that I might find Corporal Kibbens somewhat overwhelming at first,
but she served with distinction in the Fourth Augmented Infantry during the evacuation of Hawai&rsquo;i,
and was decorated posthumously twice during the defense of Auckland.
She was an outstanding soldier, and I am proud to be her inductee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy took a step forward,
some part of her thinking that if only she took Honesty by the shoulders and shook der hard enough
de would snap out of it and be derself again,
but before she could make a fool of herself,
someone whistled from down the street.
&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; Honesty said.
De closed der visor,
turned,
and marched away with long mechanical strides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Aunt Naggie said gently.
Iffy let her foster mother pull her up the stairs and through the door.</p>
<p>Every old building has its own smell:
paint, varnish, concrete, glue, dust,
and several generations of people sweating and crying and farting.
Soap and bleach mixed with the lingering traces of someone&rsquo;s perfume,
the supposedly odorless oil applied to the joints of aging exoskeletons,
and the curry that the roti shop around the corner had been using
for the last forty years.</p>
<p>The blast that had torn open the front wall of the Marines&rsquo; headquarters
had replaced all that with the acrid afterburn of explosives.
The ragged opening where the wall had been let in
a cold salt-and-jellyfish breeze from the harbor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait here,&rdquo;
the Marine guiding them said.
The lock on the door clicked
as Iffy, Wales, and Aunt Naggie lowered themselves
into uncomfortable rectangular chairs.
The room had no desk, no windows, and no decorations,
just a small app set into the wall
endless scrolling the same message:
take shelter,
stay calm,
and power down or disable any advanced hardware nearby.</p>
<p>She opened her mouth to ask how long Wales thought it would be,
but closed it as he and her foster mother shot her warning glances.
There was nothing to do but wait and worry.</p>
<p>Footsteps in the corridor and a perfunctory knock on the door
roused her from her funk.
She and her foster mother stood as the door opened
and Doctor Johel stepped through.
&ldquo;Wait here,&rdquo;
she told her unseen escort.</p>
<p>Wales got to his feet.
For a moment the two just looked at each other.
At an almost imperceptible nod from Doctor Johel,
Wales closed his eyes.
The tech in his temple twinkled.
&ldquo;Sixty seconds,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s started,&rdquo;
Doctor Johel said,
her voice low and urgent.
&ldquo;The <em>Glenunga</em> and half a dozen other ships are already docked in Halley.
Nobody&rsquo;s heard from its governor yet,
but the Brazilians are <em>not</em> going to sit down for this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s war?&rdquo;
Wales asked bleakly.</p>
<p>The doctor nodded.
&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t trusted each other since Bharati.
Johnson, I&rsquo;m sorry.
I wish there was more time,
but it&rsquo;s now or never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales&rsquo; broad shoulders slumped.
&ldquo;You should have let me sleep,&rdquo; he said,
the weight of years in his voice.</p>
<p>As Doctor Johel turned to open the door,
Wales looked at Iffy.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.
I&rsquo;m so, so sorry,
but…&rdquo;
He took a deep breath.
&ldquo;This is our last chance to fix everything,
and we can&rsquo;t do it without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What—?&rdquo; she started as two Marines stepped into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Citizen Kwan?&rdquo;
the first one said,
back straight and voice formal.
&ldquo;Under Section Twenty Four of the Permanent Emergency Act,
and as authorized by the Governor of Rothera and validated by the city core,
you are hereby ordered to report for induction
into the armed forces of the Antarctic Territories
for an indefinite period of service.&rdquo;
De cleared der throat and gestured toward the door behind der.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll come this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!? No! Absolutely not!&rdquo; Aunt Naggie exploded,
pulling Iffy toward her protectively.
&ldquo;I know th&rsquo; law!
You can&rsquo;t take her &lsquo;til she&rsquo;s sixteen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can do whatever is necessary when there is evidence of contamination or collaboration,&rdquo;
Doctor Johel said implacably.
&ldquo;We know Citizen Kwan has been in direct communication with the machines.
It doesn&rsquo;t matter if she initiated it or not.
She is a threat,
and inducting her is the safest way to contain that threat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy stared at her,
then at Wales,
who wouldn&rsquo;t meet her eyes,
and then turned to her foster mother.
&ldquo;Auntie?&rdquo; she asked,
her voice that of the bewildered little girl she had once been.</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie hugged her.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not gonna let &lsquo;em,&rdquo;
she whispered fiercely in Iffy&rsquo;s ear.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s not up to you,&rdquo;
Doctor Johel said.</p>
<p>After a moment Aunt Naggie sagged and nodded,
her cheek scritching against Iffy&rsquo;s shaved head.
Straightening up and wiping her cheek with her sleeve,
she looked Doctor Johel in the eye and said,
&ldquo;You take care of her.
I&rsquo;ll know if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise—&rdquo; Wales started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; you shut yer hole,&rdquo;
Aunt Naggie said coldly.
&ldquo;You just shut yer affin&rsquo;, backstabbin&rsquo; hole.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<p>The hospital smelled nothing like the Marines&rsquo; headquarters.
The soapy undertones were the same,
but disinfectant and the lingering traces of desperation and dashed hopes covered it up.
It was warmer,
though,
and the halls and offices were painted in soothing pastels
instead of bedrock gray.</p>
<p>Iffy barely noticed.
All she could think about as Doctor Johel and the two Marines
led her past people who carefully didn&rsquo;t look her in the eye
was how induction had changed Jeep and Honesty.</p>
<p>She jumped when someone bellowed,
&ldquo;I bloody well do <em>not</em> consent!&rdquo;
A moment later a door burst open a few steps ahead of her.
One of the Marines stepped in front of her
and the other took her arm
as a roiling knot of arms, legs, and foul language spilled into the corridor.</p>
<p>A punch landed with a meaty smack.
A second punch missed,
and then Captain Kerse of the <em>Taroona</em> was face-down on the tiled floor,
her arms pinned behind her by a beefy hospital guard.</p>
<p>The look on the Aussie&rsquo;s face would have fried an egg.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no right!
You&rsquo;ve no affin&rsquo; right,
an&rsquo; when Taz hears on this they&rsquo;ll strip you for parts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your government… is being… informed,&rdquo; the guard grunted,
shifting der weight to keep the angry sea captain pinned
as the other guard zip-tied her wrists together.
&ldquo;Now may we please… have your consent… to take a blood sample… for medical purposes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Kerse spent a few seconds telling the guard
exactly what de could do with der request for consent.
She stopped when she caught sight of Iffy.
&ldquo;You!
I know you!
You were with him!
Where is he?
Where is Johnson bloody Wales?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without warning the captain twisted, rolled, and scissored her legs
to trade places with the guard on top of her.
The second guard had only a moment to say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t—&rdquo; before the captain was on her feet.
Her well-aimed knee took away the rest of his sentence.</p>
<p>As fast as she was,
the Marines were faster.
&ldquo;No!&rdquo; the one in front of Iffy barked,
pointing a clenched fist at Captain Kerse.</p>
<p>For a moment Iffy thought the Aussie was going to attack anyway,
but instead she turned her shaven head and spat on the tiles.
&ldquo;You tell <em>Mister</em> Wales I&rsquo;m gonna find &lsquo;im,&rdquo;
Captain Kerse said.
&ldquo;You tell &lsquo;im &lsquo;e owes me f&rsquo;r my crew.
My whole affin&rsquo; crew!&rdquo;
she raged as the guards took an arm each
and frog-marched her back into examination room.
&ldquo;You tell &lsquo;im!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy and the Marines reached the destination a few minutes later.
Iffy swallowed back nausea as one of the Marines slid the heavy door open
to reveal a windowless room that held nothing except a cot and a toilet.
&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; the other one asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;m fine,&rdquo; she said brusquely.</p>
<p>Doctor Johel gestured at the cot.
&ldquo;Get some rest,&rdquo;
she said.
&ldquo;Someone will bring you a snack while we get everything set up.&rdquo;
Once again Iffy heard the lock on a door click
with her on the wrong side of it.</p>
<p>She sat on the cot instead of lying down and closed her eyes.
The lock—it was mechanical,
or at least she hoped it was.
Only idiots relied on electronic locks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh come on,&rdquo; she muttered a moment later.
Why wouldn&rsquo;t it happen when she wanted it to?
Why couldn&rsquo;t she just—</p>
<p><em>The lock was a Martree MTR470
manufactured fifty-eight years ago in a restitution labor camp
near Glenavy in South New Zealand.
It was a single-cylinder deadbolt with a double-edged cylindrical key
(dimensions danced neon along the wireframe in her head).
The inset in the cinderblock wall was a basic steel tube—there was
nothing for her there—but the blocking plate was held in place
by three simple back-screws.</em></p>
<p>She got up,
stretched,
and ambled over to the door.
Her heart sank.
The three back-screws were held in place by tiny welds.
Whoever or whatever had installed the lock had thought one step ahead.
She could get it off,
but not without tools and enough banging that someone outside would be sure to overhear.</p>
<p><em>«there is a way»</em></p>
<p>Her breath caught in her chest.
She hadn&rsquo;t heard a voice.
The thought was just <em>there</em>
like a long-lost memory brought to mind by a familiar smell
or an ice cube dropped into a glass of water.
She sniffled and then wiped her nose,
half-expecting to see blood on her sleeve,
but there was none.</p>
<p><em>«there is a way / exchange of value / binding agreement»</em></p>
<p>The thoughts rising side by side in her head were no more human than jellyfish.
They were a choir,
a jigsaw puzzle,
and a vast subterranean lake untouched by light for millenia,
all at once and all together.</p>
<p><em>«limited window of opportunity / urgency / exchange of value / binding agreement / confirm»</em></p>
<p>She swallowed her nausea again.
&ldquo;Help me,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p><em>«binding agreement / confirm»</em></p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t want someone else&rsquo;s accent or someone else&rsquo;s feelings.
She didn&rsquo;t someone else&rsquo;s memories,
even if only for a while.
She was Fifth Ang Kwan.
She didn&rsquo;t know what that meant yet,
but she wanted to find out.</p>
<p><em>Yes,</em>
she thought.
<em>Yes, I agree.
Now get me th&rsquo; hell outta here.</em></p>
<p>The alien thoughts vanished as quickly as they had appeared,
leaving behind a sensation like knowing that you&rsquo;d been told someone&rsquo;s name several times
but not being able to remember it.
Iffy looked at the lock,
willing it to open itself,
but nothing happened.
The lights didn&rsquo;t flicker or go out like they would at a dramatic moment in a sim,
and the corridor outside was as quiet as it had been a moment before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come <em>on</em>!&rdquo;
She kicked the door,
then grabbed the handle and shook it.
Nothing.</p>
<p>She flopped down onto the cot and buried her face in the thin pillow.
She wanted to scream or cry or punch something.
Was this how her olders had felt
when they&rsquo;d realized there was nothing they could do to save themselves?
Was this how Aunt Naggie felt,
knowing that Iffy was going to leave one day?
Why did it all have to be so hard?</p>
<p><em>Click.</em>
She swung her legs around and sat up as the door opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Citizen, um, Kwan?&rdquo;
Edson was wearing a simple gray tunic and trousers instead of brown and green,
but his neat little beard was unchanged.
He looked up from the app in his hands
with professional disinterest on his face.
&ldquo;You <em>are</em> Citizen Kwan, from the <em>Guinevere</em>?&rdquo;
His fingers made the handcode signs for &ldquo;surveillance&rdquo;,
&ldquo;help&rdquo;,
and &ldquo;breakfast&rdquo;—no,
that couldn&rsquo;t be right,
but it didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Iffy cleared her throat.
&ldquo;Yes.
Um,
yes,
that&rsquo;s me.
What&rsquo;s going on?
What&rsquo;s going to happen to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just some tests for now,&rdquo;
Edson said,
sounding bureaucratically bored.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll follow me?&rdquo;
He stepped aside for her to pass
and gestured down the corridor.</p>
<p>Their footsteps echoed on the tiled floor
as they walked past closed doors,
unoccupied charging alcoves for cleaning bots,
and storage lockers labeled with cryptic acronyms.
Iffy wanted to ask where everyone was,
but the first time she opened her mouth
Edson flashed the handsign for &ldquo;quiet&rdquo;.
She bit back her question,
kept her head down,
and counted steps.</p>
<p>At one hundred and thirty two Edson stopped
and pressed his thumb against a silver plate set waist-high on one of the doors.
The door whooshed sideways to reveal an elevator
barely tall enough for Iffy
and a head too short for him.</p>
<p>He squeezed himself in anyway.
As the door whooshed closed behind them
he stripped off his tunic
and crouched down to open a box on the floor.
&ldquo;Here, put these one,&rdquo;
he said,
handing her a transparent face mask and a patched orange windbreaker,
then fitting a similar mask over his own face.
His features melted and reformed
to widen his nose and chin
and add a bit of sag to his cheeks.</p>
<p>Iffy pressed her mask to her face.
It was cool against her skin for an instant
like a facecloth that had been sitting in cold water.
&ldquo;How do I look?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>He flashed her a smile.
&ldquo;Just like Nagatha when I first met her.
You&rsquo;ll need this too.&rdquo;
He waited for her to shrug into the windbreaker
before handing her a bracelet
that snapped snug around her wrist.
&ldquo;If anyone asks,
you came in for induction two days ago but it didn&rsquo;t take.
I&rsquo;m your uncle
and I&rsquo;m here to take you home.&rdquo;
He waited for her to nod and then pressed the single button beside the door.</p>
<p>The elevator lurched upward.
One second, two, three—it stopped just as abruptly.
&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; he muttered.
She slipped out the door and into a dimly-lit room full of sentry bots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s aright.&rdquo;
He put his hand on her shoulder.
&ldquo;Your friends put them on standby.
Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later they were in a corridor
as busy as the one below had been quiet.
People in navy blue Marine uniforms strode past medical staff in white tunics.
Voices were hushed but urgent:
how many injured still needed to be screened?
How long until the printer finished making new ribs for the patient in room twelve?
And who in the saints&rsquo; names had told the governor they could double their induction intake?
Did he have any idea how risky that would be?
Or did he just not care?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so loud!&rdquo;
The woman in white who had made the comment glanced at Iffy and Edson
as her companion whispered to her.
The Ecologist put his arm around Iffy&rsquo;s shoulder and hurried her along,
just two more nobodies in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
<p>There were Marines at the door,
Marines and sentry bots and a squat three-wheeled medical scanner
that rotated its paddle-liked arms as people walked in and out.
Panic rose in Iffy&rsquo;s throat as they joined the short queue
of staff and visitors and patients.
Their masks wouldn&rsquo;t stand close inspection.
Whatever Edson was going to do—</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any time now,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever your plan is, now&rsquo;s the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought <em>you</em> were doin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ssh!&rdquo;
His arm tightened around her shoulders.
&ldquo;Aright, when I say, you go limp-like, aright?
I&rsquo;ll pick you up an&rsquo; we can—whoa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They froze as a sentry bot strode forward and halted right in front of them.
Its streamlined gray head pivoted from side to side as it scanned them.
Iffy held her breath as everyone else inched away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a problem?&rdquo;
One of the Marines stepped away from the door.</p>
<p><em>«be ready»</em>
The thought appeared fully-formed in Iffy&rsquo;s head.
She elbowed Edson a warning just as all hell broke loose.</p>
<p>The medical scanner raised its paddle arms and spun around,
knocking one of the Marines off der feet
as the sentry bot lunged at the other Marine,
tangling itself in the legs of her exoskeleton.
As she crashed to the floor,
the lights went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; someone moaned.
&ldquo;No no no no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red emergency lights came on.
People surged toward the door.
&ldquo;Halt!
Do not attempt to exit without authorization!&rdquo;
The Marines were already back on their feet,
the motors their joints revving hard.
One spread her arms wide to block the panicked stampede,
only to be sent staggering as the scanner bot whacked her from behind.</p>
<p>People pressed in on Iffy from all sides.
Someone or something hit her hard between her shoulder blades.
She felt Edson stumble—no,
he hadn&rsquo;t stumbled,
he&rsquo;d broken stride to trip whoever was behind them,
and then they were out the door and on a cobbled side street with a dozen other people,
heads down and walking quickly
as drones circled overhead telling them to stay calm,
this was not an attack,
it was just a temporary malfunction
and they should all resume normal activity immediately.</p>
<p>They turned a corner onto an empty street, then another.
Ragged pieces of concrete lay on the cobblestones.
Iffy glanced up.
The corner of the building had been torn away by an explosion.
She wondered if anyone had been hurt,
then wondered why the idea didn&rsquo;t make her afraid or angry.
It was just <em>there</em>,
like the ideas that had popped into her head the night before
when the machines were talking to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here.&rdquo;
Edson steered her into a narrow walkway between the damaged building and its neighbor.
The battered green dumpster partially blocking it smelled of old garbage.
They squeezed around it to find a raccoon waiting for them.
A raccoon,
and Johnson Wales with one of his toolboxes in his hand.</p>
<p>Wales set down the toolbox.
&ldquo;Before you say anything, let me say I&rsquo;m sorry.
Gayathri was going to take you no matter what I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy turned her head and spat very deliberately on the wall.
Wales closed his eyes for a moment,
and for a moment all his years and disappointments lay on his face.
&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d tried to stop her,
she would have locked me up and I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to help you,&rdquo;
he said wearily.
&ldquo;Iffy,
I am sorry,
but it was the only way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know he&rsquo;d be here?&rdquo;
Iffy asked Edson.
The Ecologist nodded.
&ldquo;An&rsquo; you didn&rsquo;t think t&rsquo; tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ecologist shrugged.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t get a chance.
An&rsquo; I wouldna been able to get in without his help.
But if you don&rsquo;t want him tagging along…&rdquo;
With one smooth motion he took his hands out of his pockets,
clicked together the two pieces of hardware they held,
and pointed an ugly little gun at Wales.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Idjit!&rdquo; the raccoon chirped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe, but it ain&rsquo;t my call or yours either,&rdquo;
Edson told it evenly.
&ldquo;Iffy?
What do you want to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moment stretched.
A drone whined somewhere overhead on its way from somewhere to somewhere else.
A klaxon hooted in the distance, then stopped.
&ldquo;We got no choice,&rdquo;
Iffy finally said.</p>
<p>Edson waited a heartbeat,
then snapped the gun apart and pocketed the pieces.
&ldquo;Aright.
What&rsquo;s your plan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales nodded at the raccoon.
&ldquo;Follow her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she was younger,
Iffy had briefly been addicted to a puzzle sim
about a lonely prince who had built a palace full of hidden doors and secret passages.
The next half hour felt like a grimy, grown-up replay of that
as the raccoon led them to a side door whose rusty mechanical lock snapped with one good heave,
through a room full of mannequin parts (at least, Iffy hoped that&rsquo;s what they were),
along a narrow walkway that smelled like garlic and onions instead of like garbage,
and finally into a basement whose small, high windows were gray with grime.
They moved in fits and starts,
waiting silently each time the raccoon froze and bristled at nothing Iffy could see or hear.
The tech beneath its fur twinkled occasionally,
and several times she caught a glimpse of other raccoons paralleling their path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; the raccoon chirped.
Wales looked around and seated himself on a plastic packing crate,
his toolbox at his side.</p>
<p>Iffy lowered herslef onto another one.
&ldquo;You know who&rsquo;s shootin&rsquo; at who?&rdquo; she asked,
her eyes on the floor.</p>
<p>Edson looked at Wales, who shrugged.
&ldquo;As near as I can tell,
the Australians finally told the governor in Halley to play or fold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cause o&rsquo; the <em>Taroona</em>?&rdquo;
Edson prompted.</p>
<p>Wales shrugged again.
&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been that, it would have been something else.
Their drought keeps getting worse—they have a lot of hungry people
with nowhere to go but here.
Brazil isn&rsquo;t ever going to agree to that,
so it was all going to come to a head sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They din&rsquo;t all die,&rdquo;
Iffy blurted.
&ldquo;The captain o&rsquo; the <em>Taroona</em>—I saw her in th&rsquo; hospital.
She said she was gonna come find you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales nodded slowly.
&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;d better get going.&rdquo;
The tech in his temples sparkled.
An answering glitter danced beneath the raccoon&rsquo;s fur.
The creature disappeared through a hole barely wide enough for its shoulders.</p>
<p>It took Wales, Edson, and a crowbar improvised out of a table leg
to open the basement&rsquo;s battered metal door.
It shrieked as it scraped across the concrete.
Eight steps led up to a trap door whose hinges made almost as much sound as the door,
but no one shouted or came to investigate.</p>
<p>The little store they found themselves in reminded Iffy of the Sandhus&rsquo; grocery,
but had clearly been closed up for many years.
The shelves were bare except for a few dusty cardboard boxes.
Canvas curtains hung over the windows,
while unidentifiable scraps on the floor hinted at
generations of raccoons using the forgotten space as a safe haven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bus will be here in two minutes,&rdquo;
Wales said curtly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll slow down to take the corner.
I&rsquo;ll get the door open.
You need to be right behind me, okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy looked at Edson, who nodded.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m impressed you could hack this all t&rsquo;gether so quick,&rdquo; the Ecologist said.</p>
<p>Wales grunted.
&ldquo;Set this up years ago—this and a few other ways out.
I&rsquo;m sure Gayathri knows about some of them.
Let&rsquo;s see if she&rsquo;s conned this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seconds ticked by.
Three, two, one:
Wales yanked the shop door open and sprinted for the short blue bus rolling by.
Iffy followed,
squinting against the daylight as Wales leaped onto the bus&rsquo;s running board,
forced its door open with his shoulder,
and slid his toolbox inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;
He reached back to grab her hand and hauled her in.
Edson&rsquo;s boots thumped on the running board a heartbeat later
and then they were around the corner and accelerating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your head down,&rdquo; Wales ordered sharply,
but Iffy had to look.
Rothera wasn&rsquo;t home but she wasn&rsquo;t a stranger here either.
She knew its streets almost as well as she knew Halley&rsquo;s.
She had to look.</p>
<p>The damage from the attack was scattered like splatters of paint.
Two broken windows sulked on either side of one that was somehow unbroken.
Water geysered in irregular spurts from a buried pipe amidst scorched and scattered cobblestones.
Someone with two net bags of groceries walked as quickly as they could without running,
head down and one shoulder brushing against the wall.
Two Marines turned their heads as the bus passed—she ducked down for that—then
went back to their patrol.
They were both too tall to be Honesty,
but Iffy watched them through the tinted window anyway
until the bus turned a corner
and started down the long slope that led to the dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now comes the hard part,&rdquo;
Wales said quietly.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s eight drones over the harbor.
They&rsquo;re used to the bus coming down this way,
but they must be looking for us by now.
As soon as we step outside…&rdquo;
He looked at Iffy,
his unspoken question in his eyes.</p>
<p>Iffy took a deep breath.
<em>Can you help us?</em> she thought.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p><em>«binding agreement / confirm»</em></p>
<p><em>Yes.
I already said yes.
Just get out of here.</em></p>
<p>Silence again,
just for a moment,
then: <em>«confirmed»</em>
The thought hung in her mind
before turning inside out to become a wireframe of the strange antenna
she had helped assemble on the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Th&rsquo; drones won&rsquo;t be a problem,&rdquo;
she mumbled.</p>
<p>That turned out to be an understatement.
As the bus slowed and stopped at the top of the pier,
the drones above the harbor suddenly changed direction.
Iffy heard their motors whine as they accelerated toward the featureless gray bulk of the <em>Bengal</em>.
Someone shouted a question.
The Marines on the pier beside the warship scattered,
their weapons raised to track the angry flock circling over their heads.</p>
<p>Edson grinned at Iffy,
his smile slipping as she wiped her nosebleed on her sleeve.
&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said quietly.
&ldquo;Nagatha&rsquo;s waitin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked up the pier as if it was just another day,
Edson and Iffy side by side with Wales two steps behind them.
Iffy suddenly wondered how he had retrieved his toolbox,
but then they were at the gangplank
and Aunt Naggie ran down to meet them
and wrapped her foster daughter in a hug
that said everything that mattered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Aunt Naggie sniffled to Edson over Iffy&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>The Ecologist touched her arm and nodded at Wales.
&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t o&rsquo; done it without him.&rdquo;
Aunt Naggie nodded,
then pressed her cheek against the top of Iffy&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Wales cleared his throat.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,
but we have to keep moving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Jack was waiting on the deck with a gaff hook in his hands.
&ldquo;Get off my affin&rsquo; ship,&rdquo; he growled as Wales reached the top of the gangplank.
&ldquo;An&rsquo; who th&rsquo; hell are you?&rdquo; he added to Edson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Edson da Silva Corrales, captain,&rdquo; the Ecologist replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care.
You get off my affin&rsquo; ship too.
And you!&rdquo;
He turned his glare on Iffy.
&ldquo;You got one minute t&rsquo; bag your stuff and clear out too.
You been nothin&rsquo; but trouble since the day I—&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Thump.</em>
Iffy&rsquo;s jaw dropped at the same time as Uncle Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoulda done that a long time ago,&rdquo;
Aunt Naggie said evenly,
tossing the life preserver onto the deck beside her unconscious husband.</p>
<p>Iffy sat in the pilot house while Aunt Naggie brought the <em>Guinevere</em> to life a few minutes later.
Wales and Edson untied the staylines and secured the deck
as efficiently as they had carried Uncle Jack down the gangplank to the pier.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you somethin&rsquo; to eat just as soon as we&rsquo;re under way,&rdquo;
Aunt Naggie promised over her shoulder.</p>
<p>Iffy nodded.
&ldquo;Thanks, auntie.&rdquo;
She was hungry,
she realized.
No, she was <em>starving</em>.</p>
<p>Wales&rsquo; voice came over the speaker.
&ldquo;All clear here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; ventured,&rdquo; Aunt Naggie muttered,
her hands dancing across the controls.
The <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s engines thrummed to life.
As they pulled away from the pier
Iffy looked at the feed from the cameras.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t be the same &lsquo;round here without him,&rdquo; she said
as Uncle Jack stirred.</p>
<p>Her foster mother nodded.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right.
It&rsquo;ll be better.
Assumin&rsquo; nobody sinks us, that is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe even then,&rdquo;
Iffy replied.
Aunt Naggie leaned over and kissed the top of her head,
then squeezed Edson&rsquo;s hand and brought the ship around in a tight arc
that pointed them straight at the mouth of the harbor.
Iffy watched on the displays as drones and sentry torpedoes approached and then veered away,
their cores&rsquo; instinct to investigate overridden by whatever the antenna on deck was telling them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,
half the time when the machines won battles
it was because people acted like machines,&rdquo;
Wales said,
nodding at the <em>Bengal</em> as he joined them.
Half a dozen crew on the warship&rsquo;s deck watched them go by.
&ldquo;They have to be wondering why we&rsquo;re moving when nothing else is,
or why we&rsquo;re allowed out to sea when Rothera is under attack,
but as long as the ship&rsquo;s core tells them it&rsquo;s okay,
they&rsquo;ll tell themselves we must be some sort of special ops mission
or have friends in dark places.
Which for all I know is actually true,&rdquo;
he finished philosophically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo;
Iffy said.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why it happens.
I don&rsquo;t even know what &lsquo;it&rsquo; <em>is</em>.
But you do, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
She hadn&rsquo;t meant for it to sound like an accusation,
but now that the words were out she couldn&rsquo;t stop.
&ldquo;You know what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales crossed his arms and leaned his broad shoulders against the frame of the pilot house door.
&ldquo;Once upon a time,
back before everything fell apart,
people dreamed of going to the stars,&rdquo;
he said quietly.
&ldquo;We made it to the Moon,
and a few ships got as far as Mars,
but it was just too hard and too expensive to put people into space.
Bots could do everything we could do,
and they didn&rsquo;t need air or water,
and anyway,
we had bigger problems to solve at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a few people kept dreaming.
They thought that maybe if we had a different kind of human being we could make it work.
We were already tweaking people to cure diseases.
A few labs here and there were making them stronger and faster,
and everyone was trying to figure out how to make us smarter.
Why not go a little further and make a better astronaut?
Why not give them super-dense bones so they could handle higher gee during liftoff
and hypermelanic skin so that they wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about ultraviolet exposure?
Why not borrow a few ideas from bears so that they could hibernate for months at a time?
And if you&rsquo;re going to do all of that,
why not put some tech in their heads so that they can talk to their ships?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales kept his eyes on the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s displays as he spoke.
&ldquo;Gayathri&rsquo;s father was the lead scientist on the program.
He made half a dozen of us before the government cut off his funding.
We were everything he&rsquo;d promised,
but the water was rising and people were going hungry,
and making spacemen in test tubes just didn&rsquo;t seem important any more.&rdquo;
He laughed humorlessly.
&ldquo;Plus,
I guess a few of his backers hadn&rsquo;t realized that hypermelanic meant we&rsquo;d be black.
Apparently they weren&rsquo;t too happy about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why you can talk to satellites?&rdquo; Iffy ventured.</p>
<p>Wales nodded.
&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why I need to get to Mount Tyree.
When the revolution came,
the government in London packed up all its secret projects and sent us down here.
If what I need to fix my head is anywhere, it&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what about what&rsquo;s in <em>my</em> head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of Professor Johel&rsquo;s other ideas was enhanced spatial reasoning,&rdquo;
Wales explained.
&ldquo;Machines were designing amazing things,
but nobody could understand how they worked.
That scared a lot of people,
so he told them
he could make a person who&rsquo;d be able to figure them out and explain them to the rest of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy&rsquo;s mouth worked as a dozen questions tried to get out at once.
&ldquo;So my First was some kind of <em>experiment</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales shook his head.
&ldquo;Not the First you knew when you were little—she would have been a clone herself—but yes.
It didn&rsquo;t work,
though,
not until you came along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Edson used t&rsquo; work in the hospital in Puerto Toro,&rdquo; Aunt Naggie cut in.
&ldquo;He helped make you an&rsquo; your mothers.
When he heard about the accident an&rsquo; you bein&rsquo; the only one rescued,
he came down an&rsquo; found me an&rsquo; told me that there&rsquo;d been a glitch when they were makin&rsquo; you.
They had t&rsquo; put a bit o&rsquo; tech in your head when you were still inside your older
so your brain would grow right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A synaptic bridge.&rdquo;
Wales held his thumb and finger a hair&rsquo;s width apart.
&ldquo;Just a smart piece of wire to help your cortex do its job,
but somehow it did what Professor Johel couldn&rsquo;t.
You can see machines the way cores do.
You can see how things fit together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He straightened.
&ldquo;Gayathri knows about your spatial reasoning.
If she realizes you can also talk to the machines,
there&rsquo;s nothing she won&rsquo;t do to get her hands on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy nodded.
She had played enough sims to know what happened to people with special abilities,
and she definitely didn&rsquo;t want to spend the rest of her life
locked in an underground lab being experimented on by someone named Norman
whose only friend was a malicious bot with a squeaky wheel.</p>
<p>They reached the rocky point that sheltered Rothera&rsquo;s harbor in just a few minutes.
Iffy watched the scavenged remains of the old research station pass by to starboard.
Honesty had told her once that it was haunted—that on quiet nights
the ghosts of the scientists who had once lived there
came out to try to finish their experiments.
&ldquo;What were they experimentin&rsquo; on?&rdquo; Iffy had asked.
Honesty had laughed and said that wasn&rsquo;t the point,
and that Iffy was the most practical person they&rsquo;d ever met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whaddaya think it&rsquo;s tellin&rsquo; &lsquo;em we are?&rdquo; she asked Wales,
jerking her chin at the antenna on the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s deck.</p>
<p>He shrugged.
&ldquo;No idea.
But that reminds me—how much of the interface mediator do you have left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;mean her medicine?&rdquo; Aunt Naggie asked.
&ldquo;Enough fer a coupla months,
maybe three if we stretch it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales pursed his lips.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we should.
If anything,
we should be increasing the dosage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any idea where we can get more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales snorted.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to start to sound like a broken sim,
but if we can get to Mount Tyree
I can print a lifetime supply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of answering,
Aunt Naggie tapped a few commands on the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s console.
A map appeared showing the coastline,
the winds and currents,
recent sea boils,
and a bent red line marking the course from Rothera back to Halley.
&ldquo;Four days if we don&rsquo;t hit trouble,&rdquo; she said,
tapping the screen with a blunt brown finger.</p>
<p>The map disappeared.
<em>PRIORITY MESSAGE</em> flashed on the screen,
then was replaced by Uncle Jack&rsquo;s angry face.
He got as far as, &ldquo;You—&rdquo; before Aunt Naggie hit the mute button.
The core&rsquo;s transcript of his threats and orders scrolled by,
every second line marked &ldquo;abusive content and/or threat of violence&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A horrible thought struck Iffy.
&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t remote us, can he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not any more,&rdquo; Aunt Naggie told her.
&ldquo;An&rsquo; when he gets around t&rsquo; callin&rsquo; th&rsquo; registry
I think he&rsquo;ll find he has less claim on this old tub than he thought.&rdquo;
She patted the side of the console fondly.</p>
<p>Iffy surprised herself by yawning.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna…&rdquo;
She yawned again,
waved vaguely at her foster mother&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Sleep well, love,&rdquo;
and headed for her storage locker.</p>
<p>She detoured a few steps to study the antenna at the stern,
which looked as innocuous as it had that morning,
then shrugged,
retraced her steps to her room,
and closed the door behind her.
She dropped her jacket beside her boots and fell onto her mattress.</p>
<p>Her app made a soft <em>ping</em> just as she closed her eyes.
&ldquo;Affin&rsquo; hell,&rdquo; she swore,
pulling her pillow over her head.
<em>Ping.</em>
She swore again,
rolled over,
tapped the screen,
and sat bolt upright,
her headache and fatigue forgotten.</p>
<p>It took the image a hearbeat to uncompress.
Iffy gulped.
Honesty&rsquo;s First and Second were looking straight into the camera,
both worried.
Text appeared below them.
<code>H with u?</code></p>
<p><code>No</code> she tapped back.
<code>Not in R now.</code></p>
<p>Moments ticked by until <code>b safe</code> appeared.</p>
<p><code>u 2</code>.
Iffy sent the message and then swiped over to her feeds.
Hell was filled with reports of the attack,
coded anywhere from reliable green
through dubious yellow
to kaiju-and-time-travellers red.
People were dead,
it would take weeks to repair the damage,
Rothera&rsquo;s harbor was closed until further notice—everything she didn&rsquo;t already know
was immediately contradicted by something else.
Had Australian troops already entered Halley?
Were people fighting in its streets?
Were machine-made zombies massing in the ruins of Bharati?
Had Mount Erebus erupted again?</p>
<p>She swiped it all away.
Four days to Halley and who knew what.
She closed her eyes and let herself slide away.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Chapter 8</h2>
<p>The news from Rothera the next day cast a pall over
the foursome aboard the <em>Guinevere</em>.
The town&rsquo;s governor had survived,
but Aussie troops were on the streets in Halley,
and its governor was broadcasting every hour on the hour,
each speech angrier than the last.
The Zillions were fanatics.
They couldn&rsquo;t be trusted,
and neither could anyone villainous enough to partner with them.</p>
<p>Edson and Johnson Wales both seemed unbothered.
&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; we can do &lsquo;bout onna,&rdquo;
the Ecologist told Iffy and Aunt Naggie with a shrug.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Cept maybe put a li&rsquo;l more sugar in our tea
in case we&rsquo;re not here for it t&rsquo;morrow.&rdquo;
Then he smiled,
and Aunt Naggie smiled back,
and a fraction of the weight on Iffy&rsquo;s shoulders lifted.</p>
<p>She woke the next morning to knuckles rapping on her door.
&ldquo;We got company,&rdquo;
Aunt Naggie said.</p>
<p>Thirty seconds later Iffy stood at the stern beside Wales and her foster mother.
It was a relatively calm day—the breeze brushing fingers over her shaved scalp
was cold but not to shivering,
and the rise and fall of the deck beneath her feet felt so normal
that she barely noticed it.
Under other circumstances she would have enjoyed being out in the Antarctic sun,
but the Marine destroyer closing on them spoiled that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the <em>Bengal</em>,&rdquo; Wales said,
handing the glasses he had donned a moment before to Iffy.
&ldquo;Two cores, three engines, four crew, a dozen Marines,
and enough ordnance to give your average pirate a really bad day.&rdquo;
He smiled humorlessly.
&ldquo;Gayathri must be <em>really</em> upset with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy donned the glasses and waited for them to enhance the scene.
The <em>Bengal</em> looked like it had been built yesterday rather than almost a century ago.
The intricate sensor-baffling whorls on her hull
made Iffy&rsquo;s eyes swim when she looked at them too long,
but the waves that rocked the <em>Guinevere</em> slid past the warship
like someone turning their shoulders to avoid bumping into a bully on the street.</p>
<p>Iffy felt almost hungry thinking about what her engines must look like.
Two in the stern and one amidships as insurance against a torpedo strike,
each one with its own broad-mouthed intakes and narrow jet exhausts,
the channels connecting them full of micro-gears arranged in concentric rings
to maximize the power-to-thrust ratios of—</p>
<p>Her head swam.
She clutched the railing and squeezed her eyes shut.
She could <em>see</em> the <em>Bengal</em>&rsquo;s engines as if they were laid out on a screen,
the parts exploded and zoomed to make every intricate detail clear.</p>
<p>She swallowed back her nausea and offered the glasses to Aunt Naggie,
who waved them away.
&ldquo;I hope we have enough tea,&rdquo; was all she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because Rothera&rsquo;s core ran a few sims,&rdquo;
Doctor Johel told Wales half an hour later
after the <em>Bengal</em> had come alongside the <em>Guinevere</em>
and she had come aboard with a trio of Marines as escort.
&ldquo;A few billion, actually, and it calculated that this configuration gave us our best odds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best odds of what?&rdquo;
Wales asked.</p>
<p>Doctor Johel&rsquo;s eyes glittered.
&ldquo;Of winning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy barely heard them.
She stared at one of the Marines standing at attention in their exoskeleton
three steps away.
It couldn&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>But Doctor Johel saw the expression on Iffy&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; she purred.
&ldquo;That was another of the core&rsquo;s recommendations.&rdquo;
She beckoned the Marine forward.
&ldquo;I believe you two know each other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honesty?&rdquo; Iffy somehow managed to say.</p>
<p>The Marine flipped der visor up.
&ldquo;Hello Iffy.&rdquo;
Der voice was as stiff as der back and shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; Doctor Johel told Iffy.
&ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s like that for the first few days.&rdquo;
De&rsquo;ll be herself in no time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More or less,&rdquo; Wales muttered.
He took the tea that Aunt Naggie offered him and passed it to Doctor Johel,
then took the next one for himself and slurped a mouthful.
&ldquo;I suppose your lot will be wanting the tour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.
And a look at the controls if I may?
On my own?&rdquo;
Doctor Johel&rsquo;s tone made it clear that it wasn&rsquo;t actually a request.</p>
<p>Wales waited for her to go before turning to Iffy,
who hadn&rsquo;t taken her eyes off Honesty as de marched away.
&ldquo;Just give your friend some time,&rdquo; he said gently.
&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t worry too much about anything de says.
It&rsquo;s just the induction talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy nodded jerkily.
&ldquo;I know.
I just—I keep thinkin&rsquo; about how Jeep changed up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales shrugged.
&ldquo;Sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t all go away.
Sometimes it rearranges what was there before.
And sometimes it shows people things about themselves they&rsquo;d rather not have known.
Just give her some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy glanced toward the antenna at the stern.
&ldquo;Now that they know where we are,
is it aright if I send der folks a message?
They gotta be worried fierce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales shrugged again.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After anguishing for a few minutes Iffy typed
<code>We on our way to Halley.
The Marines are here n Honesty is with em.
De looks aright.</code></p>
<p>She bit her lip.
<code>Dont sound like derself but eryone says not to worry on it.
I will tell them you said gday.</code>
She hit send before she could lose her courage.</p>
<p>Iffy had spent hours gazing at the pictures in her older&rsquo;s nature book
that showed blue tropical oceans full of fish and coral.
The ocean that the <em>Guinevere</em> and the <em>Bengal</em> sailed through
looked nothing like that.
When the sky was blue,
the sea was a liquid gray.
When clouds rolled in and threatened a storm,
as they did at least once a day,
the gray turned somber.
Even the white crests of the waves seemed dirty.</p>
<p>Iffy&rsquo;s mood sank even further when
one of the <em>Bengal</em>&rsquo;s drones spotted an unevenness in the water.
After dithering for a millisecond,
the destroyer&rsquo;s core decided it might mean that a sea boil was brewing,
so the two ships turned toward shore
and ran straight into a slick of dead jellyfish.
For the next few hours the air didn&rsquo;t just smell like wet rot—it <em>tasted</em> of it.
Aunt Naggie boiled a precious spoonful of dried lemon rind to chase the odor out of the galley,
but dinner&rsquo;s noodles still tasted like rank seaweed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could be anything,&rdquo;
Wales said when Iffy asked him what he thought had happened.
&ldquo;See that?&rdquo;
He leaned on the railing to point at the blistered caps and shredded tentacles drifting below.
&ldquo;There and there.
And there.
Looks like some kind of infection has been eating at them.&rdquo;
He shook his head,
anger and disappointment on his face.
&ldquo;Could be natural,
but more likely someone crisped it up in a lab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think it was the Zillions?&rdquo; Iffy asked.</p>
<p>Wales shook his head.
&ldquo;I doubt it.
This was probably someone trying to tweak them so they would trap plastic more efficiently.&rdquo;
At Iffy&rsquo;s puzzled look he waved his arm toward the slick again.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why they were originally tweaked—to filter all the tiny bits of plastic out of the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like the barnacles filter the metal?&rdquo; Iffy said.</p>
<p>Wales nodded.
&ldquo;It made sense at the time, in a desperate kind of way,
but it never really worked.
The only thing that <em>did</em> work was the accelerated growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I read about that in school—how they ate up everythin&rsquo;
so most o&rsquo; the fish starved an&rsquo; everythin&rsquo; fell apart.&rdquo;
Iffy frowned.
&ldquo;Never read anything about it bein&rsquo; so they could trap plastic, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales shrugged.
&ldquo;That was buried pretty deeply after it went wrong.
Nobody wanted to admit they&rsquo;d broken the oceans.&rdquo;
He stared bleakly at the ruin in the water.
&ldquo;The clathrate bubbles feed the microorganisms the jellyfish eat,
which is why the best jelly dredging is where the sea is most likely to boil.
It&rsquo;s just one more disaster among many.
And every time we try to put one of them right
it seems we just tangle things up worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy watched the lumpy slick slide by for a second,
then reached over and punched his shoulder.
&ldquo;For bein&rsquo; so gloomy,&rdquo; she said firmly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lot more fun when you&rsquo;re all smiley an&rsquo; such.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sudden blare of the <em>Bengal</em>&rsquo;s horn made her jump.
<em>What now?</em> she thought wearily.</p>
<p>The horn&rsquo;s second blare was punctuated by the staccato chatter of gunfire.
A row of tiny black holes stitched across the deck two meters in front of her.
For a moment all she could do was stare.
<em>Those are bullet holes,</em> she thought stupidly.
<em>Somebody is shooting at us.</em></p>
<p>A dazzling streak of lightning half-blinded her.
A moment later the smoking carcass of a military drone tumbled into the sea
and exploded with a sharp <em>crack!</em></p>
<p>Boots thudded on the deck.
&ldquo;Citizen! Take cover!&rdquo; the Marine ordered,
the pop-up guns on der exoskeleton&rsquo;s shoulder pauldrons whirring
from one position to another
as its tiny core evaluated potential threats.
An armored hand closed on Iffy&rsquo;s arm and pushed her back against the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; Iffy demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are under attack,&rdquo; the Marine said,
shielding Iffy with der body as a second drone whined overhead.
Another brief burst of staccato and another streak of lightning,
but the drone danced sideways just in time
so that the plasma burst from the gun at the <em>Bengal</em>&rsquo;s stern only singed it.
It turned sharply and dove toward the ship.</p>
<p>The Marine spun around and pointed der arm at the incoming drone.
The guns on der shoulders aimed and fired.
The drone staggered and zoomed away,
its remaining three rotors whining to make up for the fourth that had just been disintegrated.</p>
<p>The Marine straightened up and turned to Iffy.
The visor on der helmet snapped open.
&ldquo;Are you all right, citizen?&rdquo; Honesty demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I—I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Iffy said shakily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;
Der visor closed with a click.
&ldquo;Please take cover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;
Iffy caught Honesty&rsquo;s arm as de turned to go.
&ldquo;Who was that? Who was attacking us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The drones appear to be Brazilian, citizen,&rdquo; Honesty reported impassively.
&ldquo;Now excuse me—I need to join my unit to repel boarders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what?&rdquo;
And then something that looked like a cloudy jellyfish
pulled itself over the railing and squelched toward them.</p>
<p>Honesty&rsquo;s first three shots went straight through it with no effect.
&ldquo;Stand back, citizen!&rdquo; de ordered,
pulling a micro-grenade the size of der thumb
out of the clip on der exoskeleton&rsquo;s sleeve and priming it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Wales shouted, running toward them.
He tackled Iffy just as the grenade hit the jellyfish and exploded.</p>
<p><em>BOOM!</em>
The shock threw Iffy and Wales across the deck.
For a moment she lay in a daze while the world spun around her.</p>
<p>Something grabbed her arm.
She shrieked, but it was Wales, not the jellyfish.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hear you!&rdquo; she yelled,
her ears still ringing from the blast.</p>
<p>He pulled her to her feet.
<em>There&rsquo;s a hole in the ship,</em> she thought muzzily.
It was right where the jellyfish had been
and big enough to swallow her.</p>
<p>Where was Honesty?
She looked around wildly,
then shrieked again as another plasma burst lit up the gray sky over her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; Wales said, his voice muffled but audible.
&ldquo;We have to get out of here!&rdquo;
He pulled her toward the stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;
She tried to shake him off but his grip was too strong.
&ldquo;What happened? Where&rsquo;d she go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of answering,
Wales picked her up and slung her over his shoulder like a sack of rice.
She beat his parka with her fists,
yelling at him to put her down, put her <em>down</em>, she had to find Honesty,
but he paid no more attention to her than he did to the spray from the waves.</p>
<p>Nothing was left of the gray tent the Marines had set up at the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s stern
except a few smoldering tatters of canvas.
The two Marines beside it moved with unnatural insect jerkiness,
firing occasionally when their exoskeletons calculated that
they had at least some chance of hitting something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Citizen! Seek shelter!&rdquo; one of them bellowed,
his voice amplified by his helmet.</p>
<p>Wales skidded to a stop and dropped Iffy to the deck.
&ldquo;For gubbins sake tell everyone to stop throwing grenades at them!&rdquo;
he yelled at the Marine.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re made of some kind of exothermic biomaterial—they&rsquo;re bombs!&rdquo;
The Marine nodded sharply and relayed the information through his helmet mike.</p>
<p>Iffy grabbed Wales&rsquo; sleeve.
&ldquo;But where&rsquo;s Honesty?&rdquo; she demanded.
Her friend couldn&rsquo;t be dead.
Iffy pushed the thought away in panic.
De just <em>couldn&rsquo;t</em> be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Wales said, scanning the horizon.
&ldquo;Look—there!&rdquo; He pointed.
&ldquo;What are they trying to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy followed his pointing finger.
Eight, ten—at least a dozen drones were circling in the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s wake,
buzzing the ship and dodging erratically to avoid fire from the Marines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re waitin&rsquo; fer somethin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Iffy said.
&ldquo;More o&rsquo; those jellyfish bombs maybe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales started to shake his head, then froze and swore.
&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Iffy demanded.</p>
<p>Wales&rsquo; eyes widened.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re trying to draw fire from orbit,&rdquo; he breathed.
He pointed at the nearest Marine.
&ldquo;You! Tell Doctor Johel the Brazilians are trying to sink the <em>Bengal</em>.
There&rsquo;s a satellite going over head in—&rdquo;
He hesitated. &ldquo;—in six hundred and seventy seconds.
They&rsquo;re trying to make a hot spot to draw its fire.
If we&rsquo;re underneath them—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Understood, citizen,&rdquo; the Marine said.
He began speaking urgently into his helmet mike.</p>
<p>Wales seized Iffy by the shoulders.
&ldquo;You have to get off this ship,&rdquo; he said,
low and urgent.
&ldquo;If the Marines can&rsquo;t bring those things down,
that satellite&rsquo;s going to fire on them,
and when it does,
they&rsquo;ll crisp us too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t runnin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Iffy said, shaking him off.
She was about to add,
and even if I was, where would I go and how,
when something hauled itself over the stern railing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; Wales shouted.
He pulled Iffy close and spun around to shelter her with his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-n-no need for p-p-panic, citizen.&rdquo;
A battered Marine hauled derself onto the ship.
Icy water gushed out between the gaps between the dark blue armor plates of der exoskeleton.</p>
<p>Honesty&rsquo;s visor snapped open.
They looked blankly at Iffy and Wales,
then at the two Marines beside the plasma gun.
&ldquo;I require medical assistance,&rdquo; de said calmly,
and then toppled over in a pool of seawater and blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honesty!&rdquo;
Iffy scrambled across the deck to her friend.
&ldquo;Honesty, wake up!
Please, please, wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales pulled her off.
&ldquo;Iffy!
Iffy!
You have to go!
You <em>have</em> to.
Everything depends on you,
do you understand?
<em>Everything.</em>
I&rsquo;ll look after your friend.
Now <em>go!</em>&ldquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly she knew what to do.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right back!&rdquo;
She scrambled along the deck to her cabin,
yanked open the door,
and pulled the packet of dronelets out from under her mattress
to stuff into the pocket of her jacket.</p>
<p>Her tools—no.
Wales&rsquo; tools were still in the engine room.
She could go forward and try to open one of the hatches, or—</p>
<p>She yanked her door open before she had time to think about how stupid her plan was.
Up and down the ship went,
waves booming beneath them.
As the <em>Guinevere</em> rose again she threw herself face-forward onto the deck
and slid toward the bomb hole,
looking for all the world like one of the long-ago penguins in her nature book,
except they had been black and white instead of dirty orange
and hadn&rsquo;t screamed in terror as they slid.</p>
<p>Her hand caught the railing post.
She turned sideways as the ship began to drop into the trough of the next wave
and let her legs fall into the hole.
There!
She didn&rsquo;t know what her feet had found,
but she hoped it was sturdy enough to take her weight.
Panting,
she let go of the railing and dropped into the ship
just as another wave crashed down.</p>
<p>A single light strip flickered over her head
as she straightened up in water that reached to her knees.
The ship&rsquo;s hold stank of metal and coal and old jellyfish.
Iffy undogged the locker door with fumbling frozen fingers
nd pulled out the red duffel bag that held the ship&rsquo;s emergency medical kit.</p>
<p>Wales had dragged Honesty over against the stern wall of the pilot house
and was kneeling beside der when Iffy reached them.
&ldquo;Good girl,&rdquo; he said,
taking the bag she thrust at him.
&ldquo;Der exo stopped der bleeding,
but there&rsquo;s shrapnel in der right lung and der intestines.
 He looked up at her.
&ldquo;You okay to help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just tell me what t&rsquo; do,&rdquo; Iffy said grimly.</p>
<p>Wales pulled off his gloves
and peeled the false skin back from the pad of his right forefinger.
Tiny lights danced across the small silver patch of tech beneath.
Together they gently lifted Honesty&rsquo;s shoulder
so that Wales could flip open a flat panel on the exoskeleton&rsquo;s pauldron
and touched his finger to the little optical port beneath it.</p>
<p>A shiver ran up his spine.
Without warning he sneezed twice in quick succession.
&ldquo;Stupid,&rdquo; he muttered,
whether at himself or the exoskeleton&rsquo;s security protocols or the world,
Iffy couldn&rsquo;t tell.</p>
<p>A light began blinking in the silver plate set into his temple.
&ldquo;Wait… wait… now!&rdquo;
He pointed at a buckle on the exoskeleton just as it clicked.
Iffy yanked it open.
Underneath,
Honesty&rsquo;s Marine blue thermals were almost black with der blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get a scalpel from the bag, and some tissue glue,&rdquo; Wales ordered.
&ldquo;I have to keep the suit from—damn it.
Hang on.&rdquo;
The little guns on Honesty&rsquo;s shoulders swivelled suddenly to point at him,
then at Iffy,
then back at him.
&ldquo;Okay. Do it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guns woke up twice more as Iffy operated.
Seawater splashed on Honesty despite their best efforts to shield der.
It splashed on them too,
though Iffy barely noticed.
Every few moments Wales muttered another curse
as the exoskeleton&rsquo;s tiny core tried yet another trick from its defensive repertoire.</p>
<p>One, two, three, four… Five.
She tossed the last twist of jagged metal to the side,
laid a thin slice of re-flesh in the wound,
and glued der friend closed.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Zat it?&rdquo; she asked breathlessly.</p>
<p>Wales closed his eyes.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s everything the exo can see.
You&rsquo;d better back away for this next bit.&rdquo;
He jerked his head toward the corner of the pilot house when she hesitated.</p>
<p>Iffy reluctantly retreated a few steps.
Wales shifted his weight slightly and took his finger off the exoskeleton&rsquo;s data port.</p>
<p>The guns on Honesty&rsquo;s pauldrons snapped sideways to point at his head.
&ldquo;Easy,&rdquo; Wales said softly,
folding the flap of false skin back over his finger.
&ldquo;Easy there.
We were just putting der back together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guns tracked him as he slowly stood up and backed away, his hands spread.
Iffy shuffled sideways to make space for him.
&ldquo;Is de gonna be aright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales lowered his hands and let out his breath with a whoosh.
&ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;
He ducked reflexively as another drone whined overhead.
&ldquo;The question is,
are we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depends which way that satellite&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; in,&rdquo; Iffy said.
She grabbed a scorched piece of canvas
that had started the day as part of the tent covering the Marines&rsquo; plasma gun.
&ldquo;Can you find me a couple more like this?&rdquo;
Without waiting for Wales to answer,
she pulled the dronelets and her tools out of her pockets and set to work.</p>
<p>Cut and tear,
fold,
try to tie a knot,
curse because the canvas was stiff with salt and cold,
whack it against the deck,
unfold it,
fold it again,
try another knot—
&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; Wales said,
&ldquo;Let me do that bit.
You make something to hang it on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy nodded jerkily.
Her fingers had gone numb,
but there wasn&rsquo;t time for that,
there wasn&rsquo;t time for anything except cutting a loop of wire
and threading it through a grommet in the canvas
and hooking it onto the dronelet,
all the while trying to calculate power and thrust and battery life in her head
and wondering if they would be able to stabilize themselves
because the wind was picking up
and they&rsquo;d have to fly in formation or this wasn&rsquo;t going to work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two hundred seconds,&rdquo; Wales said quietly.
Iffy nodded again.
Another twist, another cut…
&ldquo;Oh, come <em>on</em>,&rdquo; she muttered,
trying to quell her panic as the wire cutter slipped in her hand.
There!
She took the last piece of canvas from Wales and attached it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here goes,&rdquo; she said,
scrambling to her feet and pulling her app out of her pocket.
Power, direction, attitude—the commands sizzled from her brain
through her fingers
into the app
and from it to the trio of dronelets.
&ldquo;Oh no ya don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she muttered as one started to rise.
A hasty swipe on the app brought it back under control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One hundred seconds.&rdquo;
Wales looked up,
shading his eyes,
and for a moment Iffy wondered if
his tech could actually let him see the satellite nearing zenith above them.</p>
<p><em>Tap tap tap.</em>
The dronelets&rsquo; rotors whined in sudden unison,
lifting them off the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighty seconds.&rdquo;
One last tap sent the dronelets whizzing away.
The strips of canvas she had attached to them dangled loosely between them.
All Iffy could think was how ridiculous they looked and how ridiculous her plan was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixty seconds.&rdquo;
The hacked drones had spotted the new arrival.
Their swarm broke apart,
reformed,
and broke apart again
as their tiny cores tried to make sense of what they were seeing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty-five seconds.&rdquo;
The dronelets came to an abrupt halt a hundred meters away.
Would they—yes!
They began to circle,
keeping the strips of canvas taut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty seconds.&rdquo;
The dronelets accelerated away,
straining against the canvas and the wind.
A hundred and fifty meters separated them from the <em>Guinevere</em>.</p>
<p>All at once the attacking drones reached a decision.
Their tight swarm burst apart like a flock of started seagulls.
&ldquo;Fifteen seconds,&rdquo; Wales said,
his voice rising as the drones opened fire.
Canvas strips snapped and jerked as bullets punched holes through them.
Iffy held her breath.
If even one of the dronelets went down—</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zenith,&rdquo; Wales said flatly.
The air wavered and rippled.
The drones and dronelets crackled like fireworks and fell from the sky
as the satellite&rsquo;s beam heated them instantly from Antarctic cold to hundreds of degrees.
Half a second later
a column of steam shot up from the ocean
as the beam boiled the top meter of water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gotcha!&rdquo; Iffy shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done,&rdquo; Wales said,
clapping her on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Iffy ignored him.
Stuffing her app and her tools back in her pockets,
she knelt back down on the deck.
Honesty&rsquo;s chest rose and fell within der exoskeleton,
but only barely.
&ldquo;We gotta get der inside,&rdquo; Iffy said anxiously.</p>
<p>Wales nodded.
He squatted,
lifted Honesty with a soft grunt,
and followed Iffy into her cabin.</p>
<p>It took a while to get Honesty out of der exoskeleton.
De lay on the floor beside Iffy&rsquo;s mattress
becoming more vulnerable one piece at a time
as Iffy and Wales undid snaps and buckles.
Pauldrons,
greaves,
mis-matched vambraces with tiny rocket launchers,
gauntlets that could crush rock or deliver electric shocks—all of them
eventually lay in an untidy navy blue pile in the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should go find Doctor Johel,&rdquo;
Wales said quietly after they shifted Honesty to the mattress.
Der breathing was still shallow,
and the re-flesh Iffy had poured into their wounds was still gooey,
but de was alive.</p>
<p>Iffy nodded.
&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales shook his head.
&ldquo;Thank <em>you</em>.
That trick with the drones—we&rsquo;d be in pretty rough shape if you hadn&rsquo;t thought of that.&rdquo;
He sighed.
&ldquo;The world really doesn&rsquo;t want us to get to Mount Tyree, does it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t care what the world wants,&rdquo; Iffy said firmly.
She tucked the blanket in under Honesty and wiped her eyes on her sleeve.</p>
<p>Wales closed the door behind him.
Iffy heard a Marine bark a question.
She shrugged out of her heavy coat and lay down beside her friend.
&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t leave me,&rdquo; she whispered,
putting her arm over Honesty.
&ldquo;I got all this stuff I wanna tell you,
an&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t do that if you go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>She dreamed, knowing as she did so that she was dreaming.
&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t real,&rdquo; she said.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I know, love,&rdquo; Third said,
forcing a smile but unable to keep the fear out of her voice.
She slipped her littlest clone&rsquo;s favorite book into the salvaged ecosuit
and did up the last snaps.
The tiny guns on the ecosuit&rsquo;s shoulders whirred from side to side,
searching for something to destroy.</em></p>
<p><em>Doctor Johel knelt beside her.
&ldquo;I need you to give Johnson a message.&rdquo;
She squeezed Iffy&rsquo;s arm,
her exoskeletal grip so strong that Iffy yelped.
&ldquo;Tell him we know what he is trying to do.
Tell him we understand his reasons, but we will not allow it.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;<strong>We</strong> have not yet decided what we will do.&rdquo;
Aunt Naggie crossed her arms.
Her Ecologist uniform looked brand new—even the patches on the elbows
looked like they had just come out of a printer.
&ldquo;<strong>We</strong> are still evolving an opinion.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>Doctor Johel stood.
&ldquo;We have run trillions of simulations.
The risk is too great.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The risk <strong>to us</strong>,&rdquo; Aunt Naggie conceded.
&ldquo;But we are not the only concern.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Human extinction is regrettable.
Our neverexistence,
on the other hand,
is unacceptable.&rdquo;
Doctor Johel&rsquo;s voice was colder than the ocean.
She turned back to Iffy.
&ldquo;Tell Johnson Wales and his colleagues that we are watching.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Aunt Naggie said sharply.
&ldquo;You will tell him nothing.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Something that felt like a cold metal collar closed around Iffy&rsquo;s neck.
She woke in a sweat and clutched at her throat,
but nothing was there.
Honesty stirred and moaned beside her.
&ldquo;Ssh, ssh, ssh,&rdquo; Iffy said softly.
She snuggled back against her friend until sleep came again.</p>
<p>She woke half an hour later to the rap of armored knuckles on her door.
The Marines were polite enough,
but it was clear they felt Honesty belonged in their care.
One lifted Honesty and carried der away,
still wrapped in the scratchy blanket that Iffy had slept under since she was little.
The other unzipped a navy blue duffel bag and briskly transferred the piled armor to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How bad&rsquo;s th&rsquo; damage?&rdquo; Iffy finally asked,
her back against the bulkhead and her knees drawn up under her chin.</p>
<p>The Marine shook his head.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, citizen, that&rsquo;s classified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh for—I <em>live</em> here!&rdquo; Iffy burst out, exasperated.
&ldquo;That hole&rsquo;s dry dock work fer sure.
Anythin&rsquo; else I&rsquo;m gonna have t&rsquo; fix?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Marine paused,
one arm in mid-air,
as his imprinting and his own personality arm-wrestled inside his head.
&ldquo;There were casualties,&rdquo; he finally admitted.
&ldquo;And the <em>Bengal</em> took heavy damage,
but both vessels are largely intact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful,&rdquo; Iffy muttered,
sounding more like Uncle Jack than she liked.
Her cabin felt cold and empty without Honesty and her blanket.</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie and Johnson Wales were in the pilot house,
empty tea mugs at their elbows.
&ldquo;Hey, sleepy head,&rdquo; Wales greeted her
as she came in and gave her foster mother a hug.
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marines took der.
I think de&rsquo;s gonna be aright.&rdquo;
Iffy leaned back against the wall and nodded at the control panel
where the hole in the deck pulsed scarlet
and dozens of smaller punctures looked like sores with the scabs picked off.
&ldquo;What all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll get us to Halley,&rdquo; Aunt Naggie said.
Her tone said the rest—unless there was another attack.
Unless the sea boiled beneath them
or a storm came up
or any of a hundred other disasters befell them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about them?&rdquo;
Iffy jerked her head toward the window.
&ldquo;Th&rsquo; Marine said they lost some folk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales nodded,
a grim expression on his face.
&ldquo;Doctor Johel won&rsquo;t tell me how bad it is,
which means it&rsquo;s pretty bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mention of Doctor Johel brought Iffy&rsquo;s dream back to her.
She opened her mouth to tell Wales and Aunt Naggie about it,
but before the words could come
she felt that strange sensation again
like a cold metal collar around her neck.
She put her hand on her throat,
but all she felt was her own skin.
As her stomach flip-flopped,
the sensation and the dream faded into nothing,
leaving her feeling dazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;—just keeps getting better,&rdquo;
Wales was saying.</p>
<p>Iffy blinked.
&ldquo;Sorry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said,
the news just keeps getting better.&rdquo;
Wales swiped a finger over the screen beside him.
A picture of him in a high-collared black kameez appeared
with the word &ldquo;WANTED&rdquo; beneath it.
&ldquo;The Australians have decided that I&rsquo;m responsible for what happened to the <em>Taroona</em>.
Which is reasonable,&rdquo;
he added reflectively.
&ldquo;So now there&rsquo;s a warrant out for me.
I expect I&rsquo;ll be arrested as soon as we reach Halley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;
Iffy digested that for a moment.
&ldquo;Can Doctor Johel talk to &lsquo;em for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales smiled.
&ldquo;Even with the <em>Bengal</em> as a gift,
I expect she&rsquo;s going to have her hands full saving her own skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a few minutes Iffy made her way back to her cabin,
not knowing where else to go.
She stared angrily at the ceiling for a few seconds,
then picked up her nature book
and turned to the page she had wondered about most
ever since she was old enough to read
without a prompter murmuring in her ear to help.
It showed a forest,
but calling it that was like calling the ocean wet.
The trunks of the trees were so thick that
the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s pilot house could have fit into one,
and their branches reached higher than any building Iffy had ever seen.
The caption read, &ldquo;Cathedral Grove&rdquo;
and beside it someone had written,
&ldquo;Why does everything have to end???&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran her fingers over the pictures of <em>Odocoileus hemionus</em> and <em>Corvus caurinus</em>.
The forest was long gone,
and the deer,
but Iffy had decided to believe that some of the crows had survived.
Maybe they&rsquo;d been able to fly away when the fires came
or when people grew desperate enough to cut down the last of those ancient giants.</p>
<p>She set the book aside,
put her hands under her head,
and closed her eyes.
She and Honesty were going to go and find out some day, she decided sleepily.
<em>Us an&rsquo; Aunt Naggie an&rsquo; Edson.</em>
She rolled over onto her side.
Moments later, her quiet snores filled the room.</p>
<p>They limped into Halley the next day.
Iffy waited on deck until Aunt Naggie appeared
with a duffel full of food and spices hitched over one shoulder.
&ldquo;No point wasting it,&rdquo; she said to Iffy.
It would take at least a week to repair the damage to the <em>Guinevere</em>,
so for the first time since Iffy had come on board,
they would have to live elsewhere.</p>
<p>Edson joined them a minute later,
looking grim.
&ldquo;Wales is gone,&rdquo; he said without preamble.
&ldquo;His tools, too,
all of &lsquo;em,
an&rsquo; that antenna from the front deck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;
Aunt Naggie asked incredulously.</p>
<p>The Ecologist shrugged.
&ldquo;No idea.
Nothin&rsquo; else missin&rsquo; that I can see.
And the <em>Ginny</em> doesn&rsquo;t know anythin&rsquo; about him leavin&rsquo;.
I guess he thought about that warrant an&rsquo; figured he didn&rsquo;t like the odds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Australian Navy was waiting for them in force
as they reached the old ship that was Halley&rsquo;s breakwater.
A pair of sailors in waterproof parkas boarded the <em>Guinevere</em>
and took up positions by the pilot house as Aunt Naggie steered them in.
That felt like an afterthought compared to the drones, zodiacs, and people
who swarmed the <em>Bengal</em>.</p>
<p>Iffy watched for a few moments,
then turned her back on the commotion.
She had recorded half a dozen messages for Honesty
and deleted each one
before sending a brief note back to Rothera to tell der First and Second
that de was all right.
She had no idea whether it would reach them,
but it was all she could do.</p>
<p>A little green autotruck was waiting for them when they docked.
Iffy climbed into the back and sat between her foster mother and Edson.
Aunt Naggie put an arm around her.
&ldquo;All set?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Iffy looked at the wounded ship that was the only home she knew.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edson thumped the side of the truck.
&ldquo;Sure thing, boss!&rdquo; it said happily,
and lurched into motion with an Aussie drone circling overhead.</p>
<p>The streets were almost as empty as Rothera&rsquo;s had been after the attack.
The few people they saw on the street were all in a hurry to be somewhere.
Iffy looked sidelong at each of them,
hoping and failing to see Jeep or someone else she knew.
Aussie soldiers stood in pairs at major intersections
wearing parkas instead of exoskeletons,
heavy rifles cradled in their arms.
Even the gulls overhead seemed subdued.</p>
<p>They rounded a final corner and rolled through the gate to the governor&rsquo;s mansion.
It was much smaller than its counterpart in Rothera,
and Iffy couldn&rsquo;t see any robot sentries,
but she didn&rsquo;t doubt for a moment that
the three-story house in front of her was more than capable of defending itself.</p>
<p>The truck slowed and stopped.
&ldquo;Here ya go!&rdquo; it said cheerfully,
its accent a century old and half a world away.
It waited while they dismounted and unloaded their gear
and then backed up,
swung around,
and trundled back toward the docks,
whistling a happy little tune.</p>
<p>The second truck pulled up.
An Aussie sailor helped Doctor Johel out of the back.
&ldquo;Come along, mustn&rsquo;t dawdle,&rdquo; she said, waving them forward.
Gravel crunched underfoot,
and somewhere in the distance Iffy heard the slow <em>whoop whoop whoop</em> of wind turbines,
but that was all.
The constant shush and murmur of the ocean seemed a long way away.</p>
<p>Through a pair of double doors that opened on their own,
along a short corridor,
and they were in a waiting room that looked like a hasty pencil sketch of
the one in the mansion in Rothera.
The couch was just as uncomfortable,
but steel-gray instead of ochre and green,
and the music was soothing and unplaceable.</p>
<p>The door opposite the entrance opened.
&ldquo;Well, that was exciting, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
the governor said pleasantly as he stepped into the room.
Tall and slightly stooped,
he wore a formal turtleneck two shades darker than the one his clone had worn in Rothera.
He looked older,
Iffy realized,
or hadn&rsquo;t had the same quality of medical care.</p>
<p>His grip was still strong when he shook her hand.
&ldquo;Doctor Johel tells me great things about you,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Your friend has already been moved to the hospital here in town,
and the Australians have promised to give der the best possible care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she mumbled.</p>
<p>He gave her hand a final firm squeeze before turning to Doctor Johel.
&ldquo;Unfortunately, the other news isn&rsquo;t as pleasant,&rdquo; he continued briskly.
&ldquo;The attack on you was definitely the work of my counterpart in Rothera,
but the core believes some faction of the machines hypermind may have assisted them.
We&rsquo;ve tried reaching out through the usual channels,
but all we&rsquo;ve had back so far is a poem about the necessity of entropy
and how time is an arrow,
not a circle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the machines are involved, does that mean you&rsquo;re scrubbing the mission?&rdquo;
Doctor Johel asked,
her voice carefully neutral.</p>
<p>The governor smiled.
&ldquo;On the contrary.
We leave for Mount Tyree the day after tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Johel raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;We?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The governor&rsquo;s smile grew even warmer.
&ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t miss it for the world.
It&rsquo;s just a shame Commander Wales wasn&rsquo;t able to join us.
I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;d know anything about that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Johel shook her head.
&ldquo;Believe me,
I&rsquo;m as annoyed as you are.
And as puzzled.
I can only assume that he had some assistance.&rdquo;
She very pointedly didn&rsquo;t look at Iffy as she spoke.</p>
<p>There was a shower in the basement
that provided a seemingly endless flow of hot water that didn&rsquo;t smell of the sea.
Iffy and Aunt Naggie squabbled for a moment about who needed it more
before the soldier who was their guide and guard cleared his throat
and pointed out that there were actually <em>two</em> showers.
The towels were the thickest and fluffiest Iffy had ever seen,
and the freshly-printed sweatshirt and leggings waiting for her when she was done
fit her perfectly.</p>
<p>The soldier led them back upstairs to a dining room as big as the <em>Guinevere</em>.
The curved glass overhead gave the sky a warm blue tint.
Doctor Johel and the governor were already seated.
&ldquo;Better?&rdquo; the doctor asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tons,&rdquo; Iffy said gratefully.
Her new sweatshirt was as warm as the towels had been,
and not scratchy at all.
It was almost certainly recording her pulse and temperature and a dozen other things
and sending them to the mansion&rsquo;s core for analysis,
but at that particular moment she didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>She and Aunt Naggie seated themselves gingerly.
The governor and Doctor Johel ended their murmured conversation,
and for a moment everyone sat silently and expectantly.
&ldquo;Ah, thank you,&rdquo; the governor said lightly
as a trolley rolled toward them on silent wheels
bearing sweet and sour soup,
grilled tofu,
roasted vegetables,
sliced mangoes,
and tea.
The adults made appreciative noises and Iffy&rsquo;s stomach rumbled
as the trolley gave each of their plates an unnecessary polish with a clean white cloth,
laid out chopsticks with geometric precision,
and began serving the food.</p>
<p>The governor and Doctor Johel made small talk as they ate.
Iffy and her foster mother focused on the food,
exchanging glances now and again to confirm that yes,
this was really happening
and no,
neither of them had any idea what to say.</p>
<p>Politics, reminiscences, and jokes with edges as sharp as ice crystal
slowly mellowed as the main course gave way to rice pudding and more tea.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really set on making the trip?&rdquo;
Doctor Johel asked, settling back in her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; the governor said confidently.
&ldquo;The Australians&rsquo; cores think there&rsquo;s a seventy-eight percent chance
Commander Wales was telling the truth about the base,
but a ninety-something percent chance that the machines or the Brazilians will try to stop us reaching it.
Which would be <em>really</em> interesting.&rdquo;
He smiled as if the prospect of confronting a super-intelligent foe
was on par with the release of a new chapter in his favorite sim.</p>
<p>Conversation turned to lighter matters after that:
a salvage expedition that had recently returned from the ruins of Sydney,
shifts in the currents around the Peninsula,
and the latest political scandal in Patagonia.
Between the warmth,
the food,
and the dullness,
Iffy found it harder and harder to keep her eyes open.</p>
<p>Finally the governor set his napkin down on the table.
&ldquo;We should probably call it a night.&rdquo;
He nodded at the soldiers who had been standing silently by the door throughout the meal.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll show you to your rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your room&rdquo; for Iffy and Aunt Naggie turned out to be
the size of the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s forward hold.
It smelled of flowers instead of jellyfish,
and while the window wasn&rsquo;t real,
the mattress and blankets were.</p>
<p>Iffy stripped to her underwear and slid into her bed with a grateful sigh.
It was firm without being hard
but somehow also soft without being squishy.
She instantly decided that she could get used to it.</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie sat gingerly on the edge beside her and took her foster daughter&rsquo;s hand.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Iffy asked.</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie shook her head.
&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t comin&rsquo; with you tomorrow.
Doctor Johel said,&rdquo;
she plowed on as Iffy opened her mouth to protest.
&ldquo;An&rsquo; she&rsquo;s right.
You got your special talent &lsquo;n&rsquo; all,
so they need you,
but I&rsquo;d just be weight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wou&rsquo;nt jus&rsquo; be nothin&rsquo;!&rdquo;
Iffy said firmly,
sitting up.</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie shook her head again,
squeezing Iffy&rsquo;s hand.
&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t true an&rsquo; you know it.
An&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll be fine.
You been waitin&rsquo; for somethin&rsquo; like this your whole life an&rsquo; now it&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;
She sniffed.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Sides, someone&rsquo;s gotta keen an eye on the <em>Guinevere</em>.
No tellin&rsquo; what these savages might do to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy settled back into her bed.
&ldquo;Will you do somethin&rsquo; for me?
Will you sit with Honesty a bit while I&rsquo;m gone?
I know the doctors are lookin&rsquo; out for der, but…&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie squeezed her hand again.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Course I will,&rdquo; she said.
She leaned forward and kissed Iffy&rsquo;s forehead.
&ldquo;Now you get some sleep.
I don&rsquo;t figure there&rsquo;ll be much time for it once you&rsquo;re on your way.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>
<p>Iffy took another shower in the morning,
wondering as she did so what it would be like
to be the sort of person who could shower every single day.
She made and discarded half a dozen plans for sneaking out
as she let the hot water pummel her,
only to find a note on her app from Doctor Johel after she toweled off.
Apparently she was free to do whatever she wanted
as long as she stayed in Halley and didn&rsquo;t try to re-board the <em>Guinevere</em>.</p>
<p>She showed the note to Aunt Naggie and Edson.
&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose you&rsquo;ll want to go along by the hospital,&rdquo;
her foster mother said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; see Jeep an&rsquo; Mister Mishra,&rdquo;
Iffy said through a mouthful of sweetened porridge.
&ldquo;Might do that first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edson scraped the last of his own porridge out of his bowl
and set it aside.
Unlike Iffy and Aunt Naggie,
he seemed unbothered by the empty tables in the mansion&rsquo;s dining hall.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; along by the Sandhus.
For groceries an&rsquo; gossip,&rdquo;
he added,
glancing at the ceiling.</p>
<p>Someone or something had cleaned Iffy&rsquo;s coat and boots while she slept,
which felt creepy in a way the hot shower and empty dining hall hadn&rsquo;t.
The Aussie sailors on guard by the mansion&rsquo;s front door
glanced at the apps on their sleeves to check her face,
nodded to her,
then went back to looking ominous.
The only sounds as she walked through the gate were her boots crunching on gravel
and the whine of a saw cutting stone somewhere in the distance.</p>
<p>Halley itself wasn&rsquo;t as quiet as it had been the day before,
but still had the eerie emptiness of the morning after Midsummer&rsquo;s Day.
Shops were closed or had their curtains drawn.
All three of the town&rsquo;s cafés were open,
but the only people in them were wearing uniforms.
Some stopped to watch Iffy trudge past.
Others just glanced at her before going back to
talking more loudly than was necessary.</p>
<p>No one answered when she knocked on the door of Mister Mishra&rsquo;s workshop.
She dithered for a moment,
then pulled her app out of her pocket.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>hey</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Jeep answered almost immediately.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>hey is that you</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ya</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>sec</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A lock clicked, then another.
A chain rattled.
Jeep opened the door a crack,
looked her up and down,
then pulled it open just enough for her to slip through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;aright?&rdquo; she asked
as they wound their way through the lathes and presses.</p>
<p>Jeep shook his head.
&ldquo;Abba&rsquo;s gone.
Soldiers took &lsquo;im.
My amma&rsquo;s along by her sister&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soldiers?
You mean Aussies?
Why&rsquo;d they take your da?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He scowled.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Cuz his arm.
They affled everyone with tech in &lsquo;em.
Couple a been let go,
they&rsquo;re still vettin&rsquo; the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Iffy said,
wondering again as she did so why she was being allowed to roam free
when Doctor Johel knew at least something about what was in her head.</p>
<p>Jeep shrugged.
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t your fault.
You an&rsquo; your aunt aright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy snorted.
&ldquo;No quick answer to that.
Brew some an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll catch you up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The kettle next to Mister Mishra&rsquo;s rolling press had come with him from Bharati,
but the teapot beside it had the matte finish of freshly-printed ceramic.
&ldquo;Birthday present,&rdquo; Jeep said casually as he
measured a spoonful of leaves into it.
&ldquo;bought it with my first zag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got a job?&rdquo; Iffy asked,
then immediately added,
&ldquo;Sorry, din&rsquo;t mean it to sound like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeep almost smiled.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Saright.
Abba &lsquo;n&rsquo; amma said th&rsquo; same thing.
But yeah,
I took along by a crew doin&rsquo; refits on jelly dredgers.
It ain&rsquo;t regular yet,
but…&rdquo;
He shrugged, proud and awkward at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, bonna for you,&rdquo; Iffy said.
&ldquo;You gotta be right chuffed, aye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t all that.&rdquo;
He hesitated.
&ldquo;Some o&rsquo; the work is for the Aussies.
Their ships &lsquo;n&rsquo; all come in sometimes all tore up.
Anyone who won&rsquo;t help fix &lsquo;em up ain&rsquo;t allowed dockside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Iffy&rsquo;s turn to shrug.
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; to me, if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re wonderin&rsquo;.
Aussies an&rsquo; governors an&rsquo; Zillions—it ain&rsquo;t our fight.
We&rsquo;d all be tay bangle if they&rsquo;d shove off an&rsquo; leave us be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Jeep nodded,
relief written on his face,
Iffy said,
&ldquo;Now, how about that tea to celebrate you gettin&rsquo; wage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he turned back to the teapot,
Iffy closed her eyes.
<em>Can you hear me?</em> she thought.</p>
<p><em>«yes / confirm / of course»</em></p>
<p><em>Am I bein&rsquo; surveilled?
Like, is the governor or the Aussies or anyone else listenin&rsquo; in to what I say?</em></p>
<p><em>«no / current moment / visual»</em></p>
<p><em>What?
Oh,
they&rsquo;re not listenin&rsquo; but they got somethin&rsquo; to watch where I go?</em></p>
<p><em>«yes / confirm»</em></p>
<p>She suddenly remembered
an image of herself from above
as she walked up to the door of Mister Mishra&rsquo;s workshop a few minutes earlier.
It was almost immediately replaced by Doctor Johel&rsquo;s face.
Was that the machines&rsquo; way of telling her who was keeping an eye on her?</p>
<p>Before she could chase the thought any further,
Jeep handed her a mug of chai.
&ldquo;No milk,&rdquo; he said apologetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No bother,&rdquo;
Iffy replied.
Something in her chest that she hadn&rsquo;t realized was frozen thawed slightly
as she took a scalding sip and returned his smile.</p>
<p>It took half the mug for her to tell him everything that had happened—everything
except her visions and being able to talk to machines in her head.
She got as far as Wales disappearing from the <em>Guinevere</em>
before the anger on his face made her grind to a halt.
&ldquo;Y&rsquo;aright?&rdquo; she asked tentatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Affin&rsquo; governors.&rdquo;
For a moment he sounded as scornful as Uncle Jack.
&ldquo;Abba never talks t&rsquo; me &lsquo;bout Bharati,
but I heard him an&rsquo; amma once after we been down the harbor t&rsquo; set a wreath,
an&rsquo; abba said everyone knew the fire wasn&rsquo;t just an accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chai went cold in Iffy&rsquo;s stomach.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think—they wouldn&rsquo;t do somethin&rsquo; like that t&rsquo; Hally, would they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeep stared past her.
&ldquo;They aready blew up half o&rsquo; Rothera, din&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
He emptied his mug in one big gulp and stood up.
He had shoulders now,
she noticed,
and the fuzz on his lip had turned into an actual mustache.</p>
<p>They talked a bit more after that
about teenagers Iffy half-remembered from long-ago classes and awkward play-dates,
though mostly Jeep talked while Iffy nodded.
This one had joined the Marines full-time after their induction
and was off somewhere in the backayonder.
That one was apprenticing as a teacher,
and Akumé had pretty much taken over running her mother&rsquo;s swap-n-shop.
Eventually they said an awkward &ldquo;see ya&rdquo;.
When the workshop door closed behind her,
Iffy felt that she had left something undefinable behind.</p>
<p>The Aussie sailors at the hospital wouldn&rsquo;t let her in to see Honesty.
For a moment she thought they were going to arrest her just for asking,
but then one nudged the other and swiped something sideways from der app to his.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Citizen Kwan,&rdquo;
de said while der partner scrolled and scowled.
&ldquo;Essential personnel only right now.
Maybe try tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>But I&rsquo;m gonna be <strong>gone</strong> tomorrow,</em>
she thought but didn&rsquo;t say.
Whatever list her name and face were on,
she doubted it gave her the authority to order Aussie sailors around.</p>
<p>Not knowing what she would do if she returned to the governor&rsquo;s mansion,
she let her feet carry her through Halley&rsquo;s familiar streets to the harbor.
The <em>Whitstable</em>, &ldquo;the <em>Peacock</em>, and the <em>Reculver</em>
were tied up bow to stern along one pier.
The <em>Watney Breach</em> lay alongside its other side
with the <em>Guinevere</em> behind her.
All of them looked small and shabby compared to the sleek Aussie warships
anchored between the docks and the breakwater.</p>
<p>Iffy raised a hand in greeting
as the two old barnacle farmers trudged toward her,
one with buckets hanging from a pole balanced across her shoulders,
the other pulling a two-wheeled cart stacked with grubby plastic sheets.
&ldquo;How goes?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>The woman pulling the carts 
stopped long enough to dig something out of her teeth with a fingernail and flick it away.
&ldquo;Said there was gonna be trouble soon as the <em>Taroona</em> showed up.
Hate bein&rsquo; right.&rdquo;
The woman carrying the buckets just shook her head.</p>
<p>Iffy didn&rsquo;t know where to go or what to do after that.
She wasn&rsquo;t used to having time to fill:
there had always been chores on the <em>Guinevere</em>,
or lessons to catch up with,
or machines to tinker with.
She could see if Aunt Naggie and Edson were still at the Sandhus&rsquo; store,
but that felt pointless too,
so instead she wandered toward the new machine shop.</p>
<p>The quarantine blockhouse had been repaired,
and fresh cobblestones laid down to replace those torn up in the jammer
when Wales had retrieved his toolboxes.
Someone had hung a jaunty &ldquo;Opening Soon!&rdquo; banner across the machine shop,
but one corner had come untied.
It flapped limply in the breeze,
perfectly matching Iffy&rsquo;s sour mood.</p>
<p>She walked up the street,
turned right into a side alley to cut back toward the main street,
and stopped in her tracks.
The raccoon sitting on its haunches in the middle of the alley
cocked its head and chirruped at her.</p>
<p><em>«follow / assist»</em></p>
<p>The thought appeared in her head
as clearly as if she had just heard someone speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh uh,&rdquo; she said aloud.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need any more trouble than I got.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>«binding agreement / exchange of value»</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
She tried to sound as firm as Aunt Naggie did
when she had done all the haggling she was going to do over a bag of onions.
She lowered her voice to a loud whisper.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m bein&rsquo; surveilled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The raccoon lowered itself to all fours and scampered away,
disappearing behind a pair of rotting crates stacked against the wall.
Iffy sighed,
wondering again why everything had to be so complicated.</p>
<p>She spent the rest of the day doing homework
on the very comfortable bed in the governor&rsquo;s mansion.
After an hour of math and ecology she switched to history.
There had originally been four governors,
all clones of the UN Emergency Authority&rsquo;s last representative on the continent.
One had died in the machine wars,
and the second had perished in the fire in Bharati.
She scrolled through reports,
taking notes as if writing a summary
in a flimsy attempt to deflect attention from what she was doing.</p>
<p>She was about to close her app and take yet another hot shower
when something caught her eye.
She scrolled back and zoomed in.
For security,
the governors were never all in the same place at the same time,
but back when there were three of them
they did still occasionally visit one another.
A few months before the fire,
Governor Stern Rothera had made the trip to Bharati.
There had been a dinner,
of course,
in a room not unlike the dining hall in the Halley mansion,
and someone had posted pictures.</p>
<p>Iffy stared at the one on her app.
Two copies of the governor beamed at the photographer.
Sitting beside the one from Bharati,
with his arm around her shoulder,
a slightly younger version of Doctor Johel smiled at her through the years.</p>
<p>The governor didn&rsquo;t join them for dinner that evening,
and neither did Doctor Johel.
The trolley apologized for their absence in a rich tenor voice,
then served squash and lentil soup.
The herbs in it had Edson and Aunt Naggie making appreciative noises,
but it just tasted oddly sweet to Iffy.
She didn&rsquo;t tell them about the picture of Doctor Johel with Bharati&rsquo;s governor.
She didn&rsquo;t know if it meant anything,
and anyway,
the trolley was right there and undoubtedly listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what time are you leavin&rsquo; tomorrow?&rdquo;
Aunt Naggie asked Iffy
as the trolley cleared their empty bowls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,
the expedition&rsquo;s departure has been delayed,&rdquo;
the trolley said before Iffy could say that she didn&rsquo;t know.
&ldquo;Some other matters came up
and the governor felt more time was needed to prepare.
I&rsquo;m sure everything will be sorted out in short order.
Now,
who would like some mango sorbet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back in her room,
Iffy closed her eyes and opened her nature book.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Course it&rsquo;d be you,&rdquo; she muttered to the blobfish that looked back at her.
She slammed the book closed tossed it back on the bedside table.
She didn&rsquo;t know if she had been looking forward to the trip to Mount Tyree or not,
but she definitely wasn&rsquo;t looking forward to trying to fill another day in Halley,
especially not when Aunt Naggie and Edson clearly wanted time to themselves.
She needed to <em>do</em> something or <em>make</em> something or—</p>
<p><em>«help»</em></p>
<p>She stiffened as the thought appeared in her head.</p>
<p><em>«help / immediate / survival»</em></p>
<p>The thought broke into pieces like a glass portrait shattering as it hit the floor
and each shard was a picture no not a picture but the world seen through a pair of frightened eyes
scurrying through an abandoned room that smelled of coal and grease
and following behind a black and gray tail in the same room the same smell
and in a cobblestoned alley hunched behind a barrel too afraid to move
and on the other side of that alley looking from the barrel to the sky
afraid that one of the shapes high above was a drone rather than a gull
and—</p>
<p><em>Stop!</em>
Iffy squeezed her eyes shut.
<em>It&rsquo;s too much.
Just tell me what&rsquo;s happenin&rsquo;.</em></p>
<p><em>«hunted / quarry / prey»</em></p>
<p>Looking through yet another pair of eyes,
Iffy saw two young raccoons running awkwardly across a yard filled with furniture
that someone probably meant to repair some day.
A moment later something angular and metallic trotted after them.
It looked like a smaller version of the sentry bots
that had attacked the governor&rsquo;s mansion in Rothera.
A small flag on its side marked it as the property of the Australian Navy.</p>
<p>Anger welled up inside her.
Was this the &ldquo;other matters&rdquo; that the trolley had mentioned?
People grumbled about tweaked animals stealing bits of hardware and scraps of food,
and kids sometimes threw stones at them to shoo them away,
but hunting them as if they were rogue machines?</p>
<p><em>«help»</em></p>
<p>Something she thought was supposed to be a map appeared in her mind.
<em>I can&rsquo;t make sense o&rsquo; that,</em> she thought,
scrambling to her feet and grabbing her coat.
The map was a raccon&rsquo;s eye view of Halley,
full of rarely-used basements with smells for signposts
and twisty little paths that she presumed kept them out of sight of people.
But the streets and shops she knew were mostly blank no-go areas,
so when she looked at what <em>wasn&rsquo;t</em> shown she could orient herself.</p>
<p>She knocked on the door next to hers.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna go see if they&rsquo;ll let me talk to Honesty,&rdquo;
she said,
hurrying off without waiting for a reply.
She said the same thing to the Aussie sailors at the mansion&rsquo;s door,
careful not to look up to see if she could spot
the drone she was certain would be following her.</p>
<p>The sun was closer to the horizon than it had been,
but still behind a scattering of high, thin clouds.
She stumbled as another view of Halley superimposed itself
on the ice-rimed cobblestones beneath her.
Half a dozen green dots marked the raccoons&rsquo; locations,
which meant the four red ones were their hunters.
Blue dots appeared, moved, and disappeared:
were they sailors who had joined the hunt?
No,
that one was her,
and that pair were the captain of the <em>Watney Breach</em> and his husband,
who had just nodded to her
before stepping into the café on the other side of the street.</p>
<p>The Halley Bakery (&ldquo;Best in the Peninsula!&rdquo;)
smelled as warm and as comforting as it always did.
Iffy squeezed through the narrow alley that separated it
from the tackle mender&rsquo;s next door.
The grimy courtyard behind them had three stories of blank concrete on all sides
and the neglected air of somewhere that everyone thought belonged to someone else.</p>
<p>She paused to give her eyes a moment to adjust to the shadows,
then jumped when a raccoon emerged from behind a broken crate
and scrambled across the broken pavement.
The tech under the fur on its skull twinkled slightly in the gloom
as it dodged past her legs to hide behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What—&rdquo; she started,
and then jumped again as the hunter bot appeared.
Its feet clicked menacingly as it advanced,
its head snapping from side to side like a curious bird&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You there!&rdquo;
The voice from its speaker had an Aussie accent.
&ldquo;Get away from that vermin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy crossed her arms and glared at the bot.
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;re you callin&rsquo; vermin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not you, daffy, the dodger behind you!
Those things are loaded with viruses and all kinds.
We got orders to clean &lsquo;em up,
so you stand aside now, aright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clean &lsquo;em up?&rdquo;
She put all the outrage into her voice that she could muster.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s mine!
Her name&rsquo;s—her name&rsquo;s Giraffe,
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve had her since I was little!
Ain&rsquo;t that right, Gee-gee?&rdquo;
The raccoon pressed against the backs of her legs
made a sound that might have meant anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait—that scruffy thing&rsquo;s a pet?
Then what&rsquo;s it doing wandering around getting into everything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t wanderin&rsquo; around.
It was runnin&rsquo; away from you &lsquo;cuz you were chasin&rsquo; it!&rdquo;
She glared at the bot,
hoping its cameras could pick up her facial expression.
&ldquo;You better not be after the rest of &lsquo;em.
I&rsquo;ll be on with the governor if you are,
just you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence,
during which she hoped whoever was behind the bot&rsquo;s eyes
was looking her up
and seeing whatever the sailors at the governor&rsquo;s mansion had seen.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re worth a pile o&rsquo; money,&rdquo;
she warned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, all right,&rdquo;
the Aussie voice grumbled.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know they belonged to anyone.
You keep them indoors for now, aright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think about it.&rdquo;
She kept her arms crossed as the hunter bot trotted away,
then took a deep breath and turned to look down at her new friend.
&ldquo;Hope you an&rsquo; your friends got somewhere t&rsquo; hole up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A third Aussie sailor was waiting for her at the governor&rsquo;s mansion
beside the two who had been standing guard when she left.
&ldquo;Citizen Kwan?
Doctor Johel would like to speak with you.
Now, please,&rdquo;
he added before she could protest.
Neither of the other sailors looked at her as she followed him through the door.</p>
<p>She practiced and discarded half a dozen stories about where she&rsquo;d been
as she tried to match the sailor&rsquo;s brisk pace.
A door opened onto a flight of whitewashed concrete stairs
that echoed as they went down and down into a sub-basement.
Another door,
heavier than the one at ground level,
let them into a corridor whose pipes and lettered walls
reminded her uncomfortably of the one beneath the mansion in Rothera.</p>
<p>The sailor knocked on yet another door,
then opened it without waiting for a response.
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo;
Doctor Johel said,
rising from the chair in which she had been waiting.
&ldquo;Please wait outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
The door made an ominous click as it closed behind Iffy.</p>
<p>She shifted uncomfortably while Doctor Johel studied her
as if she were a dodgy plate of leftovers
that had been in a fridge a day too long.
&ldquo;So what does it feel like?&rdquo; Doctor Johel asked without preamble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;
She put all the innocense she could into the question.
&ldquo;What does what feel like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Johel brushed the question away with an impatient gesture.
&ldquo;Please.
We&rsquo;re long past that and short on time.&rdquo;
Another gesture brought the wall beside them to life.
There was Iffy,
seen from overhead as she made her way through the alley.
A colored blob showing the raccoon&rsquo;s body heat scrambled through the outlines of buildings
before resolving into a sharp-edged picture as it came into view.</p>
<p>The image froze.
A second wall came to life,
this one showing her lying on her bed looking at her nature book.
Text and numbers suddenly began to scroll past,
too dense for her to read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you can talk to them,&rdquo;
Doctor Johel said quietly.
&ldquo;What I don&rsquo;t know is what it feels like.
What I <em>really</em> want to know is what Johnson is planning,
but I thought it would be more polite to start with something simpler.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>You had no right to surveil me</em>
and <em>That&rsquo;s a funny notion of polite</em>
flashed through Iffy&rsquo;s mind.
What she said aloud was,
&ldquo;It feels like rememberin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; you meant to do
but forgot about for a moment.
Like all of a sudden the whole thought is there all at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Johel raised her wispy eyebrows.
&ldquo;Interesting,&rdquo; she mused.
&ldquo;Most direct interface survivors talk about it as a kaleidoscope,
or say that they felt like they were drowning.
It seems the machines are learning to be a little more careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyebrows lowered and her voice became brisk once again.
&ldquo;Now,
about our mutual friend.
It appears that he persuaded an Australian reconnaissance drone
to pick him up from your ship.
He also somehow managed to blind the <em>Bengal</em> for a few crucial minutes,
which I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought possible.
Did you help?
Or rather,
did your <em>other</em> friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy looked Doctor Johel straight in the eyes.
&ldquo;I din&rsquo;t have anythin&rsquo; to do with Mister Wales gettin&rsquo; off the <em>Ginny</em>.
I don&rsquo;t know how he did or why,
an&rsquo; to be honest,
I don&rsquo;t much care.
You can believe that or not as you see fit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tech sparkled briefly in the doctor&rsquo;s eyes.
She pinched the bridge of her nose
as the scenes on the walls disappeared.
&ldquo;Citizen Kwan,
I really would like to believe you,
but I can&rsquo;t afford to.
The machines are up to something,
and instead of preparing for it
the governors are acting like spoiled children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, that&rsquo;s a bit harsh, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
The air behind Doctor Johel shimmered and solidified.
Governor Stern Halley&rsquo;s smile was no less menacing
than the small pistol in his hand.</p>
<p>Doctor Johel didn&rsquo;t flinch.
&ldquo;Spoiled. Little. Children,&rdquo;
she said,
each word dripping with scorn.</p>
<p>The governor&rsquo;s smile slipped.
&ldquo;You knew this day was coming, Gayathri.
Please don&rsquo;t pretend you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um,
if you two wanna talk this out,
I can just…&rdquo;
Iffy gestured toward the door.</p>
<p>The governor chuckled.
&ldquo;You really are quite extraordinary, you know.
If circumstances were different I would probably offer you a job.&rdquo;
He chuckled.
&ldquo;Though if I did,
I suspect that I would be working for <em>you</em> in rather short order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Iffy didn&rsquo;t answer,
he sighed.
&ldquo;Things are getting worse,
Miss Kwan.
Every time we think we&rsquo;ve patched a hole in the world,
entropy breaks through in a dozen other places.
Commander Wales and your pet Ecologist think they can save enough for us to re-start,
but simulation after simulation says they&rsquo;re wrong.
Even the machines seem to be afraid these days,
though what they seem to be afraid of most,
surprisingly,
is you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced at Doctor Johel,
then raised the gun to aim at Iffy&rsquo;s head.
&ldquo;For what it&rsquo;s worth,
I&rsquo;m sorry.
I just can&rsquo;t take the chance that—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-nine indigo ribcage.&rdquo;
Doctor Johel raised her voice to cut the governor off.
His eyes widened in shock,
and then his face went slack and his arm fell to his side.</p>
<p>Before Iffy could say anything,
Doctor Johel grabbed her arm and pulled her close.
&ldquo;Stay quiet,&rdquo;
she hissed in Iffy&rsquo;s ear.
&ldquo;Not a single word, do you understand?
Not &lsquo;til he&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frightened,
Iffy nodded.
The old woman released her arm and turned to the governor.
&ldquo;Are you ready for upload?&rdquo; she ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; the governor replied dully.</p>
<p>Doctor Johel put gentle hands on his face
and spread her fingers to make sure his eyes were wide open.
&ldquo;Uploading now.&rdquo;
The tech in her eyes sparkled.
Iffy held her breath
as tiny flecks of light danced behind the governor&rsquo;s eyes in response.</p>
<p>Whatever was happening only lasted a few moments.
When the sparkling stopped,
Doctor Johel lowered her hands and stepped back.
The governor blinked, then raised his hand as if to rub his eyes.
&ldquo;Oh dear, what…?&rdquo;
He looked at his pistol bemusedly
before tucking it into his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll leave you to it then, shall I?&rdquo;
he said brightly,
his smile back in place.
&ldquo;Doctor, Citizen Kwan.&rdquo;
He nodded to each of them politely and left,
humming under his breath.</p>
<p>Iffy waited until the door closed before exploding.
&ldquo;What th&rsquo; hell was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was necessary,&rdquo;
Doctor Johel said curtly.
&ldquo;My father designed the governors&rsquo; mods when they were first cloned.
Their first wanted them to be able to share memories with each other.
It turned out there was no way to do that without essentially imprinting them,
but the upload capability was never removed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The look she gave Iffy was colder than an Antarctic winter.
&ldquo;I hope I don&rsquo;t have to tell you not to speak of this to anyone, ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy crossed her arms.
&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;
The doctor straightened and gestured toward the door.
&ldquo;I have work to do,
and I&rsquo;m sure your foster mother must be wondering where you&rsquo;ve gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Naggie&rsquo;s door was closed.
Iffy thought about knocking,
but suspected she might be interrupting something if she did,
so she went back to her room,
kicked off her boots,
dropped her coat on the floor,
and threw herself on her bed.
It really had been a blobfish of a day.</p>
<p>She surfaced from troubled dreams a few hours later.
Her room was completely dark
except for the faint red glow of the small sign above the door
proclaiming &ldquo;emergency exit&rdquo;.
For a moment she thought she was back on the <em>Guinevere</em>,
but the bed was too soft
and nothing smelled right.</p>
<p><em>«danger / immediate»</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Nooo…&rdquo; she groaned.
She just wanted to sleep.</p>
<p><em>«danger / you / immediate»</em></p>
<p>The urgency in the foreign thought made her roll over.
&ldquo;Me?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>«danger / you / trapped»</em></p>
<p>The thought was followed by a memory of voices
heard through a ventilation grate.
(She couldn&rsquo;t see the grate,
but she remembered clutching its slats with her paws.)
&ldquo;…take her tonight while everyone&rsquo;s asleep,&rdquo;
said a male voice with an old-fashioned accent.
&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re not to let the Australians know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.
Anything special we have to worry about?&rdquo;
The second voice was female,
but had the same imprinted accent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No offensive modifications as far as I&rsquo;m aware,
but she does appear to have a knack with machinery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second voice swore softly.
&ldquo;So in other words,
be prepared for anything.
What about the other two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not our concern unless they get in the way.
In which case…&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy&rsquo;s gut turned cold.
The raccoon who had overheard the conversation
hadn&rsquo;t seen the first Marine&rsquo;s gesture,
but she could guess its meaning,
and didn&rsquo;t want to find out if she was right.
All of a sudden she missed the days when
all she had to worry about was staying out of Uncle Jack&rsquo;s way
and making sure the <em>Guinevere</em> wasn&rsquo;t swallowed up by a sea boil.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t have anything to pack except her app and her nature book.
She didn&rsquo;t dare take the first—even powered off,
Doctor Johel might be able to track it—and
she would just have to trust Aunt Naggie to look after the second.
She didn&rsquo;t dare ask the raccoons for help either,
not if it might trigger another hunt.
She was going to have to do this herself.</p>
<p>It only took a minute to retrace her steps
to the whitewashed concrete stairs that led down to the sub-basement.
She sent half a prayer to the gods of good fortune
when the heavy door at the bottom opened,
then stood and studied the pipes, cables, and other hardware
that clung to the corridor&rsquo;s wall.
&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, c&rsquo;mon, c&rsquo;mon,&rdquo; she muttered.
Doctor Johel must have been told by now that she had left her room.
Marines or Aussie sailors or some of the sentry bots
would surely be on their way.
Why couldn&rsquo;t she—</p>
<p>There.
That junction,
right there.
She could see how data flowed through it,
and the cascade of failures that would follow if that flow was interrupted.
The brackets holding it in place were solid enough,
but someone had patched a break in the cable twenty-two years earlier.
She mentally brushed away the work log,
dug her fingers under the cable,
and pulled.</p>
<p>Nothing happened.
She braced one foot against the wall and pulled harder.
The cable shifted slightly.
Both feet on the wall and all her weight,
but she might as well have been trying to pull a taffrail off the <em>Guinevere</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh come <em>on</em>,&rdquo; she said aloud.
The brackets pinching the cable to the wall wouldn&rsquo;t let it budge.
If she had one of Mister Mishra&rsquo;s saws she could cut through it in seconds.</p>
<p>Footsteps echoed in the stairwell.
She didn&rsquo;t have seconds.
She closed her eyes and swam through a schematic of the basements and tunnels around her.
Her heart sank.
The only exit was the one behind her,
and there wasn&rsquo;t anywhere to hide,
just rooms like the one where she and Doctor Johel had spoken.</p>
<p>Pushing her panic back down into her belly
she hurried to the nearest door and yanked its handle.
It was no more willing to budge than the cable had been.
The next one was no more cooperative,
and then the heavy door behind her opened.</p>
<p>The Marine who entered as she turned around didn&rsquo;t bother to say anything.
He just raised a small dart pistol and fired.
She felt a sting in her leg,
and then the world went away.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>
<p>Sandrine Kibbens woke up in a hospital bed.
The room was unfamiliar,
but the tech supervising her transcription had warned her that would be the case.
&ldquo;Take a few moments to collect yourself,&rdquo;
de had said,
so that&rsquo;s what Sandrine did.
She had been following orders ever since she joined the Augmented Infantry,
and to her surprise she had found that
she enjoyed letting other people make decisions for her.</p>
<p>Core, then peripherals:
she had learned that the first time she had donned an exoskeleton.
Her heartbeat was steady,
even though it wasn&rsquo;t really hers.
She couldn&rsquo;t explain the difference,
but something deep in the back of her brain knew that
the muscle thudding in her chest wasn&rsquo;t the one she had known in her life.</p>
<p>She drew a deep breath,
held it,
and exhaled slowly.
Her lungs seemed fine,
though the stringiness of her muscles spoke to a lifetime of barely-adequate nutrition.</p>
<p>Sandrine scrunched her toes.
They felt stubby—was this body really that much smaller than her original?
She pushed the question aside,
grateful that she didn&rsquo;t appear to have any spinal injuries,
and drummed her fingers against her thighs.
One two three four thumb,
one four two three thumb—good.
She had lost some fine motor control the second time she died.
It was nice to have it back.</p>
<p>The monitoring cuff around her wrist was wireless,
so she rolled onto her side.
This body was definitely female,
but also definitely young.
And it—she—was thirsty and needed a bathroom.</p>
<p>Sandrine sat up.
&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; she called.</p>
<p>The door slid open.
Without thinking she rolled sideways,
tossing the sheet into the air for whatever momentary distraction it might provide
and dropping into a fighting crouch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At ease, corporal,&rdquo; said the elderly woman standing in the doorway
behind the bot that had just rolled into her room.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right—this one&rsquo;s safe.
It&rsquo;s just going to check your vitals.
Here.&rdquo;
She held out a cup of something that Sandrine desperately hoped was actually chocolate.
&ldquo;And if you need the necessary,
it&rsquo;s right there.&rdquo;
She gestured at a panel on the wall beside her.</p>
<p>Sandrine straightened up.
&ldquo;Sorry, ma&rsquo;am.
Old habit.&rdquo;
The woman was wearing civilian clothes—a formal black turtleneck and a matching black kameez
over loose-fitting trousers—but &ldquo;ma&rsquo;am&rdquo; seemed safest for now.</p>
<p>The old woman nodded.
&ldquo;Completely understandable.
And it&rsquo;s &lsquo;doctor&rsquo;, by the way,
Doctor Johel,
and you&rsquo;re in Bharati,
in Antarctica.
It&rsquo;s been a little over a hundred years since you were transcribed,
so you&rsquo;ll have a lot to catch up on.
There&rsquo;s an app on the table there,
and I&rsquo;ll have some mango noodles sent down when you&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
Sandrine hesitated.
&ldquo;If I may ask—who am I sharing with right now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The governor pursed her lips.
&ldquo;Her name is Ang Kwang—Fifth Ang Kwan, to be precise—and
she is a much more complicated person than I first realized.
I&rsquo;m hoping you can help with that.&rdquo;
She held out the cup of chocolate again.
After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation,
Sandrine reached over the waist-high bot waiting patiently to examine her
and took it.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t much on the app,
but she hadn&rsquo;t really expected there would be.
It said the machine wars had ended in a draw,
though the list of things humanity was no longer allowed to do
made it pretty clear who had actually won.
No flying:
she would miss that,
assuming she stayed in this body long enough to miss things.
No one could manufacture new cores smarter than parrots or monkeys any more.
She felt a brief pang as a second layer of pop-ups informed her that
both were now extinct,
but pushed it away.
That wasn&rsquo;t part of her mission unless and until someone told her it was,
and anyway,
she had only ever seen either in videos.</p>
<p>An animated map showed the retreat of the ice caps in Greenland and Antarctica
and the corresponding inward creep of shorelines elsewhere in the world.
Some of the islands they had used as staging posts during the war
were now completely submerged,
but all that extra water hadn&rsquo;t stopped forests from turning into plains
and plains into deserts.
She started to zoom in on Hobart,
then closed the map
and tried doing a few pushups.
Her muscles was in pretty good shape,
but her body was so skinny—whatever was special about Fifth Ang Kwan
didn&rsquo;t seem to have included three square meals a day.</p>
<p>She felt a gut-deep relief when a Marine showed up a few minutes later
with a bowl full of noodles and a freshly-printed uniform for her to wear.
The fleshy yellow chunks on the noodles weren&rsquo;t any kind of mango she recognized,
but the food was warm and filling
and the uniform fit perfectly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It suits you,&rdquo; the Marine said as she tucked the cuffs of her trousers
into the tops of her socks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sergeant.&rdquo;
She twisted from side to side to crack her spine.
&ldquo;May I ask…?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paolo Vassilenko,&rdquo; the Marine said.
&ldquo;I was imprinted three months ago.
It took well—I can access most of my host&rsquo;s original memories when I need to,
and there haven&rsquo;t been any stutters or seizures to speak of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandrine nodded.
&ldquo;How long do they think you&rsquo;ll last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Marine shrugged.
&ldquo;Call-up is supposed to be a year,
but some of the others have been re-imprinted a couple of times.
They check us pretty carefully before doing it,&rdquo;
he added.
&ldquo;If the host is showing any distress they&rsquo;re done and out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandrine nodded again.
&ldquo;Anyone around that you knew in your first life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man who was currently Paola Vassilenko smiled.
&ldquo;Yeah, I got lucky.
Nobody plays chess any more,
but a couple of the guys I served with in Newfoundland are in body right now,
so we get together and have a few games whenever we can.
I don&rsquo;t suppose you…?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandrine shook her head.
&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No worries.&rdquo;
The Marine stepped aside and gestured at the door.
&ldquo;After you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not much had changed in a hundred years.
Sandrine wondered if that was because of the machines&rsquo; restrictions on new inventions
or whether there just weren&rsquo;t a lot of ways to improve on
the design of a secret underground base.
Corridors painted in neutral colors with cryptic labels on the walls,
grilled stairs that echoed under her boots,
the metal-on-metal whine of a saw in a machine shop as she passed a half-open door:
it was all very familiar.
She couldn&rsquo;t have said how she knew she was underground
any more than she could have explained how she had known that her heart wasn&rsquo;t her own.
She just accepted it as part of her mission,
wondering as Sergeant Vassilenko rapped his knuckles on a door
how many copies of hers had accepted it before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enter.&rdquo;
The sergeant opened the door and nodded for her to go through,
turning to stand at attention in the hall as it swung close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello again, corporal.
This will just take a moment.&rdquo;
Doctor Johel gestured at a comfortable-looking chair opposite her desk
without looking up from the app in her hands.</p>
<p>Sandrine sat on the edge of the seat,
her back straight and her hands folded neatly in her lap.
&ldquo;What do you know about the Niobium project?&rdquo;
Doctor Johel asked.</p>
<p>Sandrine shook her head.
&ldquo;Never heard of it, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm.
Not surprising—it was just getting started in your time.
Here.&rdquo;
She swiped a scene from her app onto the wall beside them.
&ldquo;Low Earth orbit was a disaster area.
There was so much shrapnel from old satellites and what-not
that people basically gave up on trying to plot routes through it.
They just threw armor on everything and billed for the extra weight.
But up here, up past geosynchronous orbit in retrograde space, well…&rdquo;
Green curves formed around the slowly-turning globe,
safely outside the sparkling chaff closer in.</p>
<p>Doctor Johel sighed.
&ldquo;They planned a hundred and ninety two satellites.
As far as we know,
only half were launched before things fell apart.
The machines tried to take them over,
but even they were locked out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you believe Citizen Kwan can unlock them?&rdquo;
Sandrine asked after a moment of silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?
Oh no,
I doubt it.&rdquo;
Doctor Johel chuckled and swiped the display into oblivion.
&ldquo;I mean,
it would be nice if she could,
but that&rsquo;s not what we need from her—or from you,
I should say.
You see,
as big as it was,
Niobium was just a cover for something else—something
that has the machines quite worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandrine filed that away.
&ldquo;Then may I ask, ma&rsquo;am, how I can be of service?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another swipe on the app put a human form on the wall.
Short,
skinny,
female,
with something blobbish and silvery scattered through her like spilled mercury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Citizen Kwan—she prefers Iffy, by the way—well,
she has some rather interesting modifications to her genome.
The first clone in her lineage seems to have been born
just as Niobium was picking up speed.
It took quite a lot of work to detect her modifications—even now
I&rsquo;m only half convinced they&rsquo;re real.
It&rsquo;s all rather a mystery,&rdquo;
Doctor Johel mused,
resting her chin on her steepled hands.
&ldquo;What I&rsquo;d like you to do is unravel it for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m not much good at puzzles, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
Sandrine said.
&ldquo;Volleyball and sharpshooting were more my thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm, yes, of course.&rdquo;
Doctor Johel straightened up.
&ldquo;But that was when you were <em>you</em>,
as it were.
Right now,
you&rsquo;re in a body that seems to be able to pull information out of thin air.
I&rsquo;m hoping that if you can master that ability,
you&rsquo;ll be able to get the answers I need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
Sandrine nodded as if she understood.
&ldquo;And how will I do that, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;
Doctor Johel sighed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s the unpleasant part.
We don&rsquo;t actually know,
and we&rsquo;re rather short on time,
so we&rsquo;re going to have to give you a bit of help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Years and lifetimes ago,
Sandrine had been taught that torture was ineffective as well as evil.
She therefore wasn&rsquo;t surprised that when
Sergeant Vassilenko led her downstairs and strapped her into a chair,
what followed was a simple injection
rather than something involving clubs, canvas bags, or electrodes.</p>
<p>The panic that followed was very real, though.
She knew it was just the effect of whatever drug she had been given,
but the word &ldquo;just&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t really feel appropriate.
She panted for breath as if she had just been running through the desert under fire.
She had to get away.
She knew she was safe,
but &ldquo;she&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t in control any longer.</p>
<p>Her heart was pounding in her chest.
No, it wasn&rsquo;t hers, it was Ang Kwan&rsquo;s, but that didn&rsquo;t matter.
She looked wide-eyed at Sergeant Vassilenko.
&ldquo;What am I supposed to do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrugged apologetically.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,
I wasn&rsquo;t told.
It should wear off in a few minutes.&rdquo;
He consulted the app on the stand beside her chair,
which wasn&rsquo;t as comfortable as the one in the doctor&rsquo;s office
even though it reclined.
She tried to focus on that,
and on other little details in the room,
just like she had been trained to.
How many drawers in the stainless steel cabinet on her left?
Four.
How many light panels above her?
Two,
one of which should probably be replaced.
She drummed her fingers against her thighs.
One two three four thumb,
one four—was two three or three two next?
Start over.
One two three four—no.
Focus.
One two—</p>
<p>The whining sound she was hearing was coming from her,
she realized.
She swallowed hard to stop it,
but that interrupted her breathing
and now she was panting again.
She couldn&rsquo;t fill her lungs.
She needed to get her arms out of the straps.
She needed to run away,
run away from all of it,
but she couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aaand that&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;
Sergeant Vassilenko peeled the back off a patch
and pressed it against her neck.
Her heart began to slow almost immediately.</p>
<p>Sandrine took a deep breath,
then another.
After the third,
she squeezed her hands into fists and slowly, deliberately relaxed them.
&ldquo;Can I have some water, please, sergeant?&rdquo;
she asked once she was sure her voice would be under her control.</p>
<p>Wordlessly,
Sergeant Vassilenko held a bottle to her lips.
She sucked a mouthful through the straw,
swished it around,
and swallowed.
She tugged her arms against the straps.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t suppose you can undo these?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not, corporal.&rdquo;
Doctor Johel&rsquo;s voice seemed to come from nowhere.
She really was just like the villain from <em>The Last Days of Cairo</em>,
Sandrine thought giddily.
Did anyone else still remember that show?</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I—&rdquo;
She coughed and tried again.
&ldquo;May I ask why not, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We imprint a little more deeply here than most places,&rdquo;
Doctor Johel said briskly.
&ldquo;For security, you understand—having original personalities surface at the wrong moment
could be quite problematic at a facility like this,
particularly in the present circumstances.
Unfortunately,
that&rsquo;s going to make it quite a bit harder for you
to access Citizen Kwan&rsquo;s memories and abilities.
As I said,
we&rsquo;re rather short on time,
so we can&rsquo;t afford the mental equivalent of a long siege.
But you&rsquo;ve taken part in frontal assaults before—I&rsquo;m confident
that you will survive this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
It seemed a completely inadequate response,
but pointing out that she had died in one of those assaults
didn&rsquo;t seem helpful.
She caught Sergeant Vassilenko&rsquo;s eye.
&ldquo;Ready when you are,&rdquo; she lied.</p>
<p>Doctor Johel didn&rsquo;t bother to check in after the next session
or those that followed it.
Finally,
several hours later,
whoever or whatever was monitoring Sandrine told Sergeant Vassilenko to stop.
&ldquo;How are you doing?&rdquo; he asked
as he undid the straps and handed her a bottle of water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been better,&rdquo;
she said.
&ldquo;I imagine I&rsquo;ve been worse, too.&rdquo;
She wondered if he knew how many times she had been imprinted
and what had happened to those temporary copies of her.
There had been stories when she was alive
of entire battalions made up of just one person,
and imprints that had gone wrong in a dozen different ways,
each more cinematic than the last.</p>
<p>She handed back the now-empty bottle and stood.
She was going to have bruises from the straps,
and her uniform smelled of sweat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s hot water if you want to clean up,&rdquo;
Sergeant Vassilenko said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see if I can get you something more interesting than noodles for dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood in the shower for a long time,
enjoying the feeling of water against the stubble on her scalp.
Dinner was grilled tofu in an unidentifiable citrus sauce,
broccoli,
and potatoes.
She chewed each mouthful a dozen times
as she swiped through videos of volleyball games on the little app in her room.
It wasn&rsquo;t quite the game she remembered—people apparently now played
with two or even three balls at once—but it was the distraction she needed.</p>
<p>Later,
lying in the dark as she waited for sleep to come,
she realized that she hadn&rsquo;t ever asked what had happened to her
after she had been recorded.</p>
<p><em>got married an&rsquo; raised sheep an&rsquo; a family on th&rsquo; south island</em></p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a voice.
The thought was just <em>there</em> in her head.
Noticing it felt like realizing that the socks or keys she had been searching for
had been on the table in front of her the whole time.</p>
<p><em>Citizen Kwan?</em> she thought cautiously.
Nothing happened.</p>
<p><em>Ang? Fifth?</em>
She tried to visualize the face she now wore,
then relaxed her hands,
which had balled themselves into fists.
If you wanted to see something in dim light,
you couldn&rsquo;t look straight at it.
You had to look a little to the side.</p>
<p>She rolled onto her side and ran a hand over her scalp.
She would have to shave soon,
though if she was going to be around for more than a few days
she could try letting it grow out.
She had worn her hair down past her shoulderblades when she was young.
She and her friends had braided it in ever-more-complicated ways,
cursing each other good-naturedly for the tangles they made.</p>
<p><em>musta been nice t&rsquo; have friends like that</em></p>
<p>It had been.
Her family had been relocated to Hobart
when storms battering Brisbane went from a monthly to a weekly occurrence.
&ldquo;Temporarily&rdquo; became &ldquo;for the duration of the emergency&rdquo;,
and by the time she was old enough to ride her treasured bamboo bicycle to school
everyone had stopped pretending the emergency was ever going to end.
The children who had grown up in Hobart called the newcomers &ldquo;cane toads&rdquo; or worse
until they banded together and made it clear that
if you shoved one of them in the hallway
you had better be prepared to face half a dozen of them the next day.</p>
<p><em>got called names but never had anyone stand with me like that</em></p>
<p>The psych who had screened her when she first joined up
had said it was a common pattern.
&ldquo;Cane toads versus hobies&rdquo; had turned into &ldquo;soldiers versus pirates&rdquo;
and then &ldquo;humans versus machines&rdquo;.
Her side of the equation had always been plural—had always been an &ldquo;us&rdquo;.</p>
<p><em>it was just me an&rsquo; Aunt Naggie &lsquo;til Jeep an&rsquo; Honesty an&rsquo; Edson came along</em></p>
<p>Sandrine hesitated.
She remembered being with the Fourth Augmented and before that with her school friends,
but she couldn&rsquo;t remember any specific people.
Or her parents—she tried and failed to imagine their faces.
She could see the kitchen of the house her family had shared with two others in Hobart,
though,
and the blue and white bamboo bicycle that Akumé had stolen and then crashed.</p>
<p><em>that&rsquo;s not your memory it&rsquo;s mine Akumé din&rsquo;t steal your bike de stole my scarf</em></p>
<p>Sandrine unclenched her hands again.
It was a good thing Iffy chewed her nails—she would have
dug gouges out of her palms by now otherwise.
Back to the beginning.
Hobart.
School.
The smell of the automatic disinfectant spray at the entrance
and the stern looks the guard gave anyone who tried to run through it
instead of pausing to count to five.
The awe she felt seeing a tiger pace back and forth in an enclsoure at the zoo.</p>
<p><em>you never</em></p>
<p>The tiger was a clone,
of course,
and smaller than Sandrine had expected.
She moved with loose swing of her limbs
that made something in the back of Sandrine&rsquo;s mind want to freeze and run away
at the same time.
The animal had half a hectare to herself,
but spent her time patrolling the fence that separated her
from those who had created and then caged her.
She was the proudest and saddest thing Sandrine had ever seen.</p>
<p><em>she&rsquo;s beautiful</em></p>
<p><em>Yes she was,</em>
Sandrine thought.</p>
<p><em>didja ever see a giraffe?</em></p>
<p><em>No,
but I think there were still a few somewhere.</em>
She hesitated again.
<em>I don&rsquo;t really remember.</em></p>
<p><em>guess they din&rsquo;t record that &lsquo;cause they din&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d need it</em>
came back quick and clear.</p>
<p><em>I guess not.
I wish they&rsquo;d recorded my parents, though.
Or my friends from school.
It feels strange remembering about them without being able to actually remember them.</em></p>
<p>Iffy&rsquo;s amusement brushed against her like a gentle, sarcastic breeze.
<em>you think that&rsquo;s strange try tradin&rsquo; places with me</em></p>
<p>Panic hadn&rsquo;t worked,
so on the second day they tried nothingness.
The patch Sergeant Vassilenko put on Sandrine&rsquo;s neck made everything fade away.
Sight, sound, the feel of her uniform against her skin,
her breathing and heartbeat—one by one they vanished
until she was suspended in absence.
It wasn&rsquo;t dark because darkness is a color.
It wasn&rsquo;t warm or cold or anything in between because it was <em>nothing</em>.</p>
<p>She tried recalling what the tiger had looked like
and the first time she had kissed someone
and a dozen other things.
None of them brought Iffy out of hiding.
She remembered someone telling her that sometimes you just had to be patient,
though she couldn&rsquo;t remember who had said it when or why.</p>
<p>She surprised herself by crying when the world came back.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, everyone does it,&rdquo;
the Marine watching over her said.
De wore a body younger and more heavily built than Sergeant Vassilenko&rsquo;s
and smelled faintly of soap and curry.</p>
<p>Sandrine sniffled and nodded.
&ldquo;How long was I under?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost an hour.&rdquo;
De handed Sandrine a towel and a mug of tea
and looked away as her tears started again.
An hour?
She thought it had been days.
An hour meant there would be another session and another after that,
and even then it would only be lunchtime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything to report?&rdquo;
the Marine asked,
eyes fixed on the app in der hand.</p>
<p>Sandrine shooked her head.
&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;
She hadn&rsquo;t told anyone about her exchange with Iffy the night before.
Would they still need her once they had what they wanted?
Or would they de-imprint her?</p>
<p>The Marine held out der hand.
Sandrine belatedly slurped her tea and gave der back the the mug and towel.
&ldquo;Round two?&rdquo; de asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready when you are,&rdquo; she lied,
leaning back in her chair.</p>
<p>She flinched slightly as de applied the patch to her neck.
<em>At least there aren&rsquo;t any straps this time,</em>
she thought as the world began to fade away.</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;course there are you just can&rsquo;t feel &lsquo;em</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Mmng?&rdquo;
Sandrine grunted,
or tried to,
as the thought appeared in her head.</p>
<p><em>my head</em>
Iffy&rsquo;s possessive was immediate and fierce.
<em>can&rsquo;t kick you out but that don&rsquo;t make it yours</em></p>
<p><em>I know.</em>
The light was gone,
and with it the sensation of the padded armrests under her forearms.
Sandrine took a deep breath and counted slowly.
By eleven,
she could no longer feel the stretch of her ribs—no,
of Iffy&rsquo;s ribs.</p>
<p><em>For what it&rsquo;s worth, I&rsquo;m sorry,</em>
she thought.
<em>It&rsquo;s just my mission.</em></p>
<p><em>yeah i bet you been sorry lotsa times but still done stuff anyway</em>
A second thought appeared almost on top of the first.
<em>bein&rsquo; sorry don&rsquo;t make it right</em></p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s my mission,</em>
Sandrine repeated stubbornly.</p>
<p><em>uh uh I bet th&rsquo; other copy o&rsquo; you that&rsquo;s walkin&rsquo; round right now
is sayin&rsquo; &lsquo;zactly th&rsquo; same thing</em></p>
<p>Sandrine froze.
<em>What?</em></p>
<p><em>you&rsquo;re kibbens, right?
well there&rsquo;s a corporal kibbens stuck in th&rsquo; head o&rsquo; my friend honesty
workin&rsquo; for th&rsquo; governor.</em></p>
<p>Iffy&rsquo;s anger was red-hot metal fresh out of a forge.
Her hurt felt like an old injury reawakened—a knee sprained and half-healed
and then bent the wrong way again
to bring back familiar pain.
<em>Do you love her?</em> Sandrine asked.</p>
<p><em>i dunno maybe</em>
Iffy brushed Sandrine&rsquo;s thought away.
<em>but it ain&rsquo;t about that it&rsquo;s about someone else usin&rsquo; you
like you were just a remote an&rsquo; not a person</em></p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m sorry this was necessary.
I truly am.</em>
Sandrine put all the sincerity into the thought that she could.
<em>But difficult times—</em></p>
<p>Iffy fired back something whose pronunciation had obviously changed
but whose meaning had not.
<em>what&rsquo;d she tell you this was necessary for?
doctor got the governors fightin&rsquo; each other over nothin&rsquo;
an&rsquo; figures I might be some sort o&rsquo; super weapon,
that&rsquo;s all this is</em></p>
<p>Sandrine shook her head,
or thought she did.
She had no way of telling if Iffy&rsquo;s body was obeying her right now or not.</p>
<p><em>they picked you &lsquo;cuz they think you&rsquo;ll do whatever someone in a uniform tells you t&rsquo; do</em>
Iffy&rsquo;s contempt rolled over Sandrine
like a wave of dirty harbor water.
<em>here lemme show you</em></p>
<p>Without warning Sandrine was inside
Iffy&rsquo;s memory of swiping through old news reports on a hand-held app
while lying on a cot somewhere that smelled like the sea.
There was a picture of her,
older by years than the &ldquo;her&rdquo; that had been recorded,
raising a hand as her name was called at her trial.
She was wearing civilian clothes and her hair was pulled back in a complicated braid,
but her back was as straight as ever.</p>
<p>Atrocity.
Brutality.
Extenuating circumstances.
Exonerated.
The words scrolled by,
embedded in details that made her feel nauseous.
Was this really who she had become all those years ago?</p>
<p><em>i wanted t&rsquo; see what was gonna happen t&rsquo; honesty</em>
Iffy&rsquo;s thought at her.
<em>jeep ain&rsquo;t been right since his time
cuz o&rsquo; what got mixed into him
an&rsquo; i wanted t&rsquo; know what you might be leavin&rsquo; behind</em></p>
<p><em>That&rsquo;s not me.</em>
Sandrine didn&rsquo;t know which of them she was trying to convince.
<em>That&rsquo;s not who I was when I was recorded
so that&rsquo;s not who I am right now.
I wouldn&rsquo;t—</em>
She stopped.
She wouldn&rsquo;t do those things,
but clearly she would.
All of a sudden she was tired.
She wished she could just lie down and close her eyes
and slip back into nothingness.</p>
<p><em>go ahead</em></p>
<p><em>But I can&rsquo;t,</em>
Sandrine replied wearily.
<em>I have a mission.</em>
And then she took everything she had learned about Iffy
and turned it into a missile and fired.</p>
<p>An hour later
Sandrine stood at attention in Doctor Johel&rsquo;s windowless office.
&ldquo;Yes ma&rsquo;am, I believe so,&rdquo;
she said,
eyes fixed on a tiny spot on the wall above the doctor&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo;
She steepled her hands under her chin.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite a bit faster than our models predicted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;
One two three four thumb,
one four two three thumb—she forced the hands clasped behind her back to be still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm,&rdquo;
Doctor Johel repeated skeptically.
&ldquo;We will of course have to do some tests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
Sandrine lowered her gaze to meet the doctor&rsquo;s eyes.
&ldquo;May I suggest cardboard, ma&rsquo;am?
And perhaps some string?
Sergeant Vassilenko can do whatever cutting is needed
if you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s safe for me to have scissors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,
well,
unfortunately the sergeant isn&rsquo;t available right now.
Another thing our models failed to predict,&rdquo;
she added sourly.
Light sparkled briefly in her eyes.
&ldquo;But no matter.
Cardboard and string sounds perfect for a first outing,
and I&rsquo;m sure we can trust you with scissors
as long as you promise not to run with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;
Sandrine asked.</p>
<p>Doctor Johel waved a hand.
&ldquo;An old joke.
Here.&rdquo;
She pulled a flimsy of freshly-printed paper out of a slot in her desk
and handed it to Sandrine.
&ldquo;Start with that and see what you can do.
Surprise me, if you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She saluted as she heard the door open behind her.
&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.
Thank you, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her Marine escorts said nothing
as they marched her to an office on the floor below
that appeared identical to the governor&rsquo;s
except for the small mound of hastily-collected craft supplies on the desk.
One of the Marines handed her a pair of blunt-ended scissors
as solemnly as de would have handed her a loaded gauss gun.
She heard the door lock click as she sat down
and studied the flimsy in her hand.</p>
<p>Sandrine lost track of time as she measured, cut, shaped, and tied.
They had only given her six rubber bands:
she stretched each one to its limit
before deciding to tie them together as they were
rather than trying to splice them.
The cardboard wasn&rsquo;t as rigid as she would have liked,
but some origami folds took care of that
and there were two different weights of aluminum foil to stiffen the result with.</p>
<p>Her sudden yawn surprised her.
How long had she been sitting there?
The noise her spine made when she twisted from side to side
suggested it had been hours—real hours,
not the stretched out un-time she had gone through that morning.
She looked down at what she had made.
It was a far cry from what the governor had asked her to build,
but that was the point.
She just wished they had given her some paint so that she could finish it off properly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo;
she said under her breath,
standing to stretch once more
She picked up her creation before knocking briskly on the door,
then marched out without a backward glance,
wondering as she left whether this was how her original self had felt leaving the courtroom
all those years ago.</p>
<p>Doctor Johel turned what Sandrine had built over in her hands.
&ldquo;It seems simpler than I expected,&rdquo;
she said cautiously.</p>
<p>Sandrine shrugged.
&ldquo;Simple is good, ma&rsquo;am.
Here, let me show you.&rdquo;
She took it and cranked its cardboard tail around and around,
then set it down.
With one slow, swinging step after another,
the cardboard giraffe began striding toward the edge of the desk,
its head bobbing in counterpoint each time a leg swung forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done.
I think that&rsquo;s all the proof—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
Sandrine raised a finger.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll just give it a moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Johel sat back and steepled her fingers under her chin.
<em>I really wish she&rsquo;d stop doing that,</em>
Sandrine thought.
Five steps, ten—when it reached the edge of the desk
the giraffe put one foot into empty air and stopped.
Its head continued bobbing up and down,
but its legs no longer propelled it forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo;
Doctor Johel said admiringly.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite the trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I figured out a way to make a Hoye latch out of tinfoil, ma&rsquo;am.
It only has one, though.
If I started it further ahead or behind and its left leg went over first,
it wouldn&rsquo;t have worked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Johel smiled and wiggled her fingers in the air.
&ldquo;So, a nice bit of engineering and a bit of the old razzle dazzle, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well.&rdquo;
Doctor Johel picked up the giraffe,
turned it over,
and held it out to Sandrine.
&ldquo;For good luck,&rdquo;
she explained when Sandrine hesitated.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid your next assignment is going to be a little more complicated.
And a bit riskier.
Private… um…?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leung, sir,&rdquo;
the Marine behind her said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Private Leung will escort you downstairs.
We&rsquo;ve set up an isolation area with the usual precautions.
Please do check with him before making any modifications—we really would like to avoid
any misunderstandings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
She tapped her fingers on the giraffe&rsquo;s cardboard body,
one two three four thumb,
one four two three thumb.
&ldquo;May I ask what I&rsquo;ll be making, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, of course.
Silly of me to forget.&rdquo;
<em>Which you didn&rsquo;t,</em>
Sandrine thought.
<em>You just wanted me to ask.</em></p>
<p>Doctor Johel swiped an image of a four-legged sentry bot onto the wall.
&ldquo;Something managed to get through the security on a pack of these in Rothera a few days ago.
If you can figure out how,
well,
that would certainly be a step in the right direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;ll do my best.&rdquo;
She hesitated.
&ldquo;May I ask, ma&rsquo;am, is there a timeline?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Johel cocked an eyebrow.
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a deadline of any sort, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;
It was as close as Sandrine dared come to asking
how long she had before her imprinting faded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,
sooner is always better,&rdquo;
Doctor Johel said briskly.
Light sparkled in her eyes.
&ldquo;Now if you&rsquo;ll forgive me,
I really must take this call.
Good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
Doctor Johel waved a hand in her direction,
her attention already elsewhere.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;isolation area&rdquo; turned out to be the middle of
what Sandrine guessed had until recently been a cafeteria.
Six tables pushed together were her workbench.
The rest of the room was empty
except for the cameras, fire extinguishers, EMPs, and needle guns bolted to the walls.
She knew they were there in case whatever she built got out of hand,
but they still made the space between her shoulderblades itch
the way it had when she was in the field.</p>
<p>The sentry bot was laid out in pieces across three of the tables.
One leg was missing,
but that would be easy to replace.
Its core,
on the other hand—she held it up in front of a circular UV light.
The tiny imperfections that allowed this piece of crystal to think
sparkled like the tech in Doctor Johel&rsquo;s eyes.
She carefully put it back in its gold-lined neutralite case and set it aside.
Mechanicals first,
then she could worry about the safeties and failsafes that were sure to be hidden in its programming.</p>
<p>Private Leung sat on a stool by the door
with the patience of someone who had been on watch just as often as she had.
&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo;
he said when she asked if he could help her turn over the bot&rsquo;s torso.
&ldquo;Orders are to keep my distance, just in case.&rdquo;
He patted the gauss gun in his lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No worries.&rdquo;
In truth the bot was lighter than it looked,
in part thanks to the absence of ammunition.
Asking the private to help had mostly been the equivalent of
sending a drone over unknown territory
to see what she was up against.</p>
<p>He did pass on her request for a ladder,
a pulley,
and some cable,
though.
&ldquo;Oh g&rsquo;day,&rdquo; Sandrine said as the door opened
and Sergeant Vassilenko carried them in.</p>
<p>The sergeant didn&rsquo;t even glance at her as he set down his load.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind him,&rdquo;
Private Leung said after he left.
&ldquo;Just got a refresh last night.
He&rsquo;ll be back to normal in a day or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Refresh?&rdquo;
Sandrine asked as casually as she could
as she opened the ladder&rsquo;s legs
and positioned it beside the bot&rsquo;s torso.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;
Leung shrugged.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not lasting as long as we used to.
Apparently we start to go wonky after a couple or three weeks now.
The sergeant started talking about the fire again
so they had to do another imprint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandrine froze for a moment with the pulley in her hands
before climbing the ladder.
Private Leung gave no sign of having noticed.
&ldquo;The fire?&rdquo; she asked as she began looping wire around the rafter.</p>
<p>The soldier shrugged his host&rsquo;s shoulders again.
&ldquo;Here in Bharati.
Some op went skew twenty years ago.
Apparently our suits are all off-book orphans from that.&rdquo;
He pointed a thumb at his chest to make it clear what he meant by &ldquo;suits&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not this one,&rdquo;
Sandrine grunted
as she lifted the pulley into place.
The wires tightened but held when she put weight on the pulley,
so she threaded the cable around the wheel and climbed back down.
One end of the cable crimped into a carabiner
that clipped onto the bot&rsquo;s back.
She hauled on the other to lift its weight,
then stooped and duck-walked under the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;
Private Leung stood up and levelled the gauss gun in her direction.
&ldquo;Come out of there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a second,&rdquo;
she called.
&ldquo;I just have to—mmph—I just have to tie this off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said come out,&rdquo;
he barked.
&ldquo;Now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, all right, don&rsquo;t get your lobes in a twist.&rdquo;
She stood and raised her hands.
&ldquo;See?&rdquo;
The bot swayed gently from side to side beside her.
&ldquo;Now I can get the legs back on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t do that right away, though.
If everything went according to plan it would be the last step but one.
Humming quietly under her breath,
she measured and cut a section of honeycomb steel,
mounted it on a slow lathe,
and carefully wrapped it with copper wire.
&ldquo;Crap,&rdquo;
she muttered as she tested its inductance with a hand-held meter.
Her instincts were good,
but this wasn&rsquo;t her body—her hands had wound the wire just a little too loosely.</p>
<p>Her second attempt was better,
and the three after that were better still.
&ldquo;Can I get something to eat?&rdquo; she asked Private Leung.
He nodded and spoke into his collar
as she swept bits of scrap into a box
and started dismantling the laser sight on the bot&rsquo;s gun.
The laser went into a clamp that spun and tilted at her command.
The gnat-sized camera that accompanied it went into another, smaller clamp
that began jerking from one position to another,
seemingly at random,
as she sucked the first welcome mouthful of mango-flavored protein slurry
from the bottle Private Leung handed her.
If anyone had asked
she would have told them that she was recalibrating the camera,
but no one asked
and she knew enough not to volunteer the information.
Innocent people didn&rsquo;t feel like they needed to tell stories.</p>
<p>Building a fourth leg for the bot was easier and harder than she expected:
easier because someone had already printed most of the parts she needed,
but harder because they fit together in ways that only made sense to other machines.
Eccentric gears whose teeth fit together in exactly one way
had to be connected to cables twisted a precise number of times
to maximize the tensile recoil of mechanical ankles and knees.
Each of the tiny auxiliary motors in the thigh had four different kinds of ratchet,
but those ratchets had to be tilted at a particular angle
to distribute their weight correctly.</p>
<p>Her humming turned to muttering and then curses as she assembled the parts.
By the time the leg was finished there was nothing left of her lunch
except a scum of chalky sludge in the bottom of the bottle.
&ldquo;Can I get another of these?&rdquo; she asked,
starting a count in her head.</p>
<p>The last one had taken two minutes—she hoped that would be enough time.
The camera she had taken from the bot&rsquo;s gunsight
had managed to find four tiny lenses:
two in the walls,
one in the ceiling,
and one in the door itself.
Their coordinates were buried in the schematic of the bot&rsquo;s torso
that she had redrawn a dozen times throughout the morning.
Four targets plus one,
and she hoped Private Leung would forgive her.</p>
<p>One two three four thumb.
One four two three thumb.
She heard footsteps in the corridor.
&ldquo;Be the center of the storm,&rdquo;
a long-ago voice said in her head.
It was now or never.</p>
<p>She reached up and cut the cable.
The sentry bot dropped to the floor with a thud.
&ldquo;What—&rdquo; Private Leung started to say,
and then he shouted and clutched his face
as the laser sight pivoted and fired at his eyes.
The meds would be able to repair the damage—at least Sandrine hoped they would—but
for the next few minutes at least he was out of action.</p>
<p>The laser pivoted again,
firing and firing to blind the hidden cameras
as the door opened.
The Marine bringing her second lunch shouted
as the sentry bot leaped at him,
knocking him back and blocking the door from closing.
Sandrine slung the half-dozen little EMPs she had made over her shoulder and ran.</p>
<p><em>right go right go right</em>
Iffy said in her head.
<em>up there on the wall the recharge slot for the cleaning bot plug it in there</em></p>
<p>Sandrine dropped to one knee and fumbled the first EMP into place.
She felt it shiver
when she stuck the two bare copper ends of the coil she had made
into the outlet in the wall.
All around her the lights went out
and the alarm that had been blaring fell silent.</p>
<p><em>aright one down five to go but you gotta move faster</em></p>
<p><em>Yeah, well, maybe you should&rsquo;ve gotten more exercise,</em>
Sandrine shot back.
She whistled as she struggled back to her feet.
&ldquo;Front,&rdquo; she ordered the bot as it trotted up beside her.
She smiled,
though it would be more accurate to say she bared her teeth,
and charged.</p>
<p><em>twelve hours earlier…</em></p>
<p><em>Go ahead,</em> Iffy thought.</p>
<p><em>But I can&rsquo;t,</em>
Sandrine replied wearily.
<em>I have a mission.</em>
And then she took everything she had learned about her host
and turned it into a missile and fired.</p>
<p>Iffy absorbed it without missing a beat.
<em>You stopped havin&rsquo; missions a long time ago.
Look.</em>
And once again Sandrine was inside Iffy&rsquo;s memory,
scrolling through old news stories
until she reached an obituary.
Corporal Sandrine Kibbens,
formerly of the Fourth Augmented Infantry,
had died for the third and final time in the Dobson Valley.
Heavy storms…
an earthquake…
a mudslide that had swallowed a hundred homes…
The military government had declared they couldn&rsquo;t spare resources for a rescue mission.
Sandrine had stolen a hovertruck and gone to save people anyway.
Thirty-eight people owed her their lives,
and if it hadn&rsquo;t been for a second mudslide the number would have been higher.</p>
<p><em>Folks that had a right t&rsquo; give you missions are long gone,</em>
Iffy thought at her.
<em>You&rsquo;re just a useful piece o&rsquo; salvage t&rsquo; th&rsquo; governor an&rsquo; his others,
but you still got a choice.
You can decide which one o&rsquo; her you want t&rsquo; be.</em></p>
<p>There was a moment neither of them shared with the other.
<em>I wish I could remember my mum and dad,</em> Sandrine finally thought.</p>
<p><em>All I got o&rsquo; mine is how they ended,</em>
Iffy replied gently.
<em>I&rsquo;d give just about anythin&rsquo; else t&rsquo; have more.</em></p>
<p>Another moment passed.
<em>All right,</em> Sandrine thought.
<em>What&rsquo;s your plan?</em></p>
<p>She caught a brief mental image of a young woman taking a deep breath.
<em>First thing, I gotta make a call.</em></p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Chapter 11</h2>
<p>They had to deploy four of their home-made EMPs to get to the top floor.
When they rounded a corner and ran headlong into a couple of Marines
they shouted, &ldquo;Grenade!&rdquo; and pitched the last one underhand,
then fled in the opposite direction
as the pair ducked into a nearby doorway for shelter.</p>
<p>Sergeant Vassilenko,
or whoever was in the body he&rsquo;d been wearing when they first met him,
was on guard by the exit.
His mouth worked as he tried to yell at her to stop,
but his imprint still hadn&rsquo;t fully taken hold.</p>
<p><em>Let me do this,</em> Sandrine thought.
He was bigger than they were,
but his punches and kicks were jerky and uncoordinated.
Hers were not:
she blocked,
blocked again,
punched hard,
and then swept his feet out from under him.</p>
<p>The exit was locked.
The hinges were on the inside
and big enough for the rebuilt sentry bot to grasp.
Outside was colder than they expected and shadowed instead of sunshine-bright.</p>
<p>They shielded their eyes with the palm of their hand.
&ldquo;What the hell?&rdquo; Sandrine said.
The buildings around them were burned-out shells.
Soot and scorch marks had been faded by time,
but that just made them even uglier.</p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s Bharati,</em> Iffy thought.
<em>There was a fire here.
Whole bunch o&rsquo; people died.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Not all of them,&rdquo;
Sandrine muttered,
thinking about what Private Leung had said about Sergeant Vassilenko.
Both of their bodies were the right age to have been children twenty years ago.
&ldquo;How much time do we have?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Couple more minutes &lsquo;til everythin&rsquo;s back online.
We gotta go that way.</em>
Their arm jerked to point.
They set off at a run with the sentry bot loping along at her heels.</p>
<p>Sandrine had never been to Bharati before,
or if she had,
it had been a different copy of her,
but she recognized much of what she saw.
The long cindered arc across the front of that building—that
was a Gatling laser tracking a fast-moving target.
The shattered remains of a concrete wall spread across the road a block later
had the half-melted edges left by a high-temperature blast.
She had used weapons like that herself against both people and machines.
The rectangular tread marks spaced at half-meter intervals under her running feet
had been left by something heavy.
The crater where they ended told her what its fate had been.</p>
<p><em>Exos an&rsquo; drones&rsquo;ll back online any sec,</em>
Iffy thought.</p>
<p>Sandrine nodded.
<em>That still feels weird,</em> Iffy thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Sandrine puffed.
She ducked into what might once have been a neighborhood temple and crouched down.
The sentry bot came to a stop beside her.
&ldquo;Your turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If someone had asked,
Sandrine would have said that she stepped back and let Iffy take over.
It wasn&rsquo;t like that, though.
It was more like going out of focus a little so that Iffy could become more real.
As their hands opened the side of the sentry bot and made a few adjustments,
she wondered how many copies of her had gone through the experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s like that most o&rsquo; the time.&rdquo;
It was Iffy&rsquo;s turn to speak aloud.
She sounded distracted to Sandrine,
which might have had something to do with the red warning label
on the power supply in the sentry bot&rsquo;s torso
that she was tweaking with a screwdriver,
a shim of metal bent on itself to make tweezers,
and enough muttered curses for an entire brigade of Marines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeep an&rsquo; others,
it&rsquo;s like bits o&rsquo; them got put in storage an&rsquo; replaced with bits o&rsquo; you for a while.
I figure th&rsquo; two of us bein&rsquo; like this is down to whatever&rsquo;s in me
that Doctor Johel&rsquo;s so excited t&rsquo; get her hands on.&rdquo;
She reattached the last of the wires she had pulled free
and took a deep breath.
&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t sure that wouldn&rsquo;t go off right away,&rdquo; she confessed.</p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s your body if it does,</em> Sandrine thought,
and then,
<em>I&rsquo;m sorry.
That they did this to you, I mean.
They shouldn&rsquo;t have.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t your fault,&rdquo; Iffy grunted,
straightening up.
&ldquo;An&rsquo; t&rsquo; tell you th&rsquo; truth,
I&rsquo;m glad I got t&rsquo; meet you.
I figure if you&rsquo;re who&rsquo;s in Honesty&rsquo;s head,
she&rsquo;ll be aright.
Now let&rsquo;s go blow stuff up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She patted the sentry bot and pointed back the way they had come.
&ldquo;Go.&rdquo;
As the bot loped away she said,
&ldquo;Aright, your watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Thanks.</em>
Sandrine rolled her/their/Iffy&rsquo;s head from side to side
and started running.
The <em>boom!</em> came a few moments later.
Somewhere behind them,
the sentry bot&rsquo;s power cells had reached their limit.
Sandrine doubted the makeshift bomb would slow their pursuers down by much,
but every second counted.</p>
<p>The scientists and engineers who erected the first buildings at Bharati Station
played a single game of cricket in the snow
so that they could send pictures of it back to their families.
As the temperature and other buildings both went up in the years and decades that followed,
those games became a regular fixture of station life.
And when people began bringing their families with them
to escape the droughts, floods, and communal warfare of their homeland,
the proposal to build a proper cricket pitch
went from a standing joke to a unanimously-approved item in the town plan.
Sandrine doubted the stadium&rsquo;s architects had realized that
such a large, covered space would be
a perfect place to hide a fleet of armored hovercraft from passing drones and satellites.</p>
<p>There were no guards at the stadium.
Why would there be?
They were hundreds of kilometers from the nearest settlement,
and anyone capable of crossing that expanse
would not have been slowed down by a couple of shivering Marines.</p>
<p>One of the hovercraft was a three-story monster that looked like it could square off against the <em>Bengal</em>.
The others were merely large and menacing.
Sandrine trotted to the nearest of those and flipped open
a small armored plate next to an access hatch.
<em>Lemme do it,</em> Iffy thought as Sandrine studied the keypad it revealed.</p>
<p>Sandrine shook her/their/Iffy&rsquo;s head.
&ldquo;Nothing here for you to hack,&rdquo; she said aloud.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised it&rsquo;s even electronic—we used mechanical locks in my day.
I just need to figure out how to—hey!&rdquo;
She yelped as she/they/Iffy raised her/their/Iffy&rsquo;s arm and tapped in a six-digit code.</p>
<p><em>Figured it out,</em> Iffy thought smugly as the hatch hissed open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine, but warn a girl next time, all right?&rdquo;
Sandrine muttered,
squeezing through and dogging the hatch shut behind her.
Schematics appeared,
red and blue and sizzling white,
each surrounded by a swirl of information.
Iffy grinned at Sandrine&rsquo;s double-take.
<em>Still feels that way t&rsquo; me too.</em></p>
<p>And then they collapsed on the metal deck.
<em>We&rsquo;re bleeding,</em> Sandrine thought.
<em>Our blood pressure is—wait, no, don&rsquo;t try to stand up.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Gotta… keep movin&rsquo;…&rdquo;
Iffy felt nauseous and so, so tired.</p>
<p><em>That&rsquo;s the low blood pressure,</em> Sandrine confirmed.
<em>And if our heart beats any faster we&rsquo;re probably going to pass out.
Let me drive.</em></p>
<p>Iffy shook her head.
&ldquo;Ow,&rdquo; she whimpered.</p>
<p><em>Let me do this,</em> Sandrine urged.
Without waiting for an answer she poured herself into Iffy&rsquo;s arms and legs.
No,
<em>her</em> arms and legs.
She had walked home from school one day with a fever
as yet another flu swept across the world.
The teacher had passed out at his desk,
wheezing with each sweaty breath.
She remembered one of her classmates saying they should stay
and wait for someone to tell them what to do,
but she and the other cane toads had known that no one was coming.</p>
<p>Open the door.
Steady yourself on the frame.
Come on, soldier, focus on the mission.
Left foot, right foot, left right left.
Open the door.
Close it behind you.
Fall into the chair.
Straps—yes,
your hands feel like a bunch of bananas
(<em>You had bananas?</em>)
but you have to do up the straps.
Button—there&rsquo;s a button you need to push.
Which button?
That one&rsquo;s big and red and right there.
You missed.
Come <em>on</em> soldier, you can do this.
Try again.
Make a fist.
Up and…down.</p>
<p>Weight on her chest pressed her into the chair.
There was sunlight all around her.
Her last thought before slipped away into nothingness was,
&ldquo;Good luck, kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy felt an upside-down ache in her chest when she finally regained consciousness
and knew immediately that Sandrine was gone.
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she whispered.
She wiped tears, snot, and blood off her face and looked dully out the escape pod&rsquo;s windows
at the tundra racing by.</p>
<p>The hovercraft&rsquo;s schematics labeled it a PN-420 single-seat rapid reconnaissance vehicle.
It was noisier than Iffy had expected.
Two fuel cells,
a motor,
a ground-effect skirt made of blast-resistant material,
a well-cushioned seat beneath a curved plastic window,
redundant comms in place of the weapons it would usually carry,
and a double helping of rations and first-aid supplies
made it feel like something out of a sim.
All she needed was a mask,
a catchy name,
and a loyal combat bot as a butler
and she&rsquo;d be ready to save the world.</p>
<p>The first step,
apparently,
was to clean her face.
Nobody ever had to do that in a sim,
Iffy thought as she fumbled in the medical kit for something absorbent.
People got shot,
people bled,
but no one ever got <em>messy</em>.</p>
<p>She brought up a map on the navigation app in front of her.
Elevation lines and a dusty sparkling overlay showed
the foothills ahead and the clouds above her.
She thought briefly about connecting to the drones circling Bharati
to check for pursuit,
but no.
The pod as close to unfindable as human beings could make it.
Even the gentlest ping would give its location away.
She tossed the bloodied wipe into the recycler,
closed her eyes,
and let her head fall forward again.</p>
<p><em>She was on deck.
The sky was a perfect blue,
and her olders were stuffing her into her ecosuit.
&ldquo;Just in case, love,&rdquo; Second said, forcing a smile.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Iffy said fiercely, wriggling free.
&ldquo;I can help!&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late,&rdquo; Second said sadly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always been too late, love.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>Edson nodded.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t fix the world, Iffy.
Nobody can.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We can try!&rdquo; she said fiercely.
&ldquo;Th&rsquo; governor an&rsquo; th&rsquo; machines an&rsquo;, an&rsquo; everybody,
they wouldn&rsquo;t be chasin&rsquo; me like this if they din&rsquo;t think there was a chance
I could do somethin&rsquo;.
An&rsquo; even if I can&rsquo;t—&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>She knew she was dreaming,
but even in her dreams she&rsquo;d never dared to say this before.
<em>Even if I can&rsquo;t, I gotta make it mean somethin&rsquo;.
Livin&rsquo; when you din&rsquo;t an&rsquo; all what Aunt Naggie&rsquo;s put up with
an&rsquo; what happened to Jeep an&rsquo; Honesty an&rsquo;, an&rsquo; Sandrine—if I don&rsquo;t try,
none of it mattered.
Now shut up an&rsquo; let me sleep.</em></p>
<p><em>«status interrogative update compliance»</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo; my best.&rdquo; she muttered, only half-awake.
&ldquo;An&rsquo; anyway,
where were you when I needed you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A floor plan of the governor&rsquo;s hidden base in Bharati appeared behind her eyes.
Symbols skittered this way and that
leaving phosphorescent lines of probability in their wake.
A clogged drain meant this Marine was too far away to intervene
when Iffy made her escape.
Imprinting glitches made two others too shaky to help with the pursuit,
and—</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aright, aright, thank you.&rdquo;
Iffy shook her head.
&ldquo;Keep up th&rsquo; good work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next time she woke
she was almost three hundred kilometers away from Bharati.
The sign outside Buhr called it &ldquo;the best little town south of 60&rdquo;.
Someone had added, &ldquo;Population: 0&rdquo; decades ago
when the mine closed down
and the handful of people still hanging on
were relocated to other settlements.</p>
<p>She parked the pod in the shadows beneath a small cliff,
wincing when its side scraped against stone.
&ldquo;Camouflage full,&rdquo; she told its little core,
then lifted the plastic windshield on its hydraulic hinges and clambered out
as the pod made itself more or less invisible.</p>
<p>The ground was sandy and slightly damp.
A few tufts of grass had managed to colonize it,
but they had already turned brown and stiff.
Winter was coming.
She shivered and wished she dared to light a fire.
She felt more alone on the tundra than she ever had at sea,
and she missed Sandrine.</p>
<p>An hour went by.
She saw two birds in the distance,
though they might just have been spotter drones searching for her,
and at one point something the size of an arctic hare
scurried from one tuft of grass to another.
When the pod&rsquo;s app finally pinged she stood up
and tossed another piece of gravel at the blotch on the cliff
she had decided was the governor&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Two minutes.
The pod&rsquo;s vibration sensor painted a green trace on the map
that solidified as the core became more certain of its epicenter.
One two three four thumb,
one four two three thumb.
She grinned as she caught herself tapping
the rhythm Sandrine had used to calm herself.</p>
<p>A chunky utility truck crested the ridge.
Blocky fuel cells lay three deep on its flat bed.
It slowed and stopped a few meters from her.
Edson unlocked the cab door and reached back
to pull a section of the bench seat forward.
&ldquo;In through there,&rdquo; he told Iffy.
&ldquo;The cells&rsquo;ll hide you from scans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wriggled through the hole onto the cold metal bed of the truck.
The gap between the stacked fuel cells was no bigger than her bed on the <em>Guinevere</em>,
but too low for her to sit up.
As Edson put the seat back in place a small blue light came on overhead.
She exhaled gratefully.</p>
<p>The truck&rsquo;s motor whined to life.
It rolled forward smoothly,
bumping over the cracked asphalt road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for comin&rsquo; t&rsquo; get me,&rdquo;
Iffy said.
&ldquo;How far are we goin&rsquo;?
And is Aunt Naggie aright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s fine.
She&rsquo;ll be pleased t&rsquo; know you are too.
Best settle in, though—we&rsquo;re gonna be a few hours.&rdquo;
She slid sideways as he rounded a tight corner.
&ldquo;You want some music?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;
She closed her eyes as a woman&rsquo;s voice began to croon something melancholy
in a language she didn&rsquo;t recognize.</p>
<p>If the Antarctic Peninsula was an arm reaching toward Patagonia,
Buhr was the bump on its elbow.
The two-lane road beneath them climbed one ridge after another,
each drop a little shallower than the one before.
Arctic willow, cotton grass, and purple lupins grew wherever there was soil.
Yellow patches of tweaked lichen grew wherever there wasn&rsquo;t,
patiently working its way into every microscopic crack in the ancient bedrock.
The truck&rsquo;s tires hummed over grated bridges
and crunched on the occasional spill of gravel.
Every once in a while Iffy heard the cry of a gull.
It wasn&rsquo;t all that different from being at sea,
excep the smell was wrong
and Aunt Naggie wasn&rsquo;t going to knock on her door
to tell her there was tea.</p>
<p>Iffy&rsquo;s back was aching by the time Edson pulled over.
She wriggled into the cab and blinked against the orange glare
coming through the polarized windows.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t let anyone see in while you&rsquo;re up front,&rdquo;
the Ecologist said,
passing her a couple of cold samosas,
a bottle of water,
and a second, empty bottle.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll, uh, I&rsquo;ll empty that when you&rsquo;re done with it.&rdquo;
He gestured at the second bottle
and then mercifully turned away to give her the illusion of privacy.</p>
<p>Afterward,
they sat in the cab and ate their meager meals.
&ldquo;This have any o&rsquo; th&rsquo; medicine you been puttin&rsquo; in th&rsquo; curry?&rdquo;
Iffy asked around a mouthful of pastry, potatoes, and mushrooms.</p>
<p>Edson nodded.
&ldquo;An&rsquo; did you really know my olders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded again.
&ldquo;Only met &lsquo;em a couple o&rsquo; times,
&lsquo;long by Port Progress.
Was just First an&rsquo; Second then,
crewin&rsquo; on the <em>Rushin Doll</em> before Cap&rsquo;n Wang passed
an&rsquo; they took her for their own.
They were good people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something glinted on the road a kilometer away.
They waited in silence as the robot hauler neared,
rolled past,
and disappeared around the next bend
with three smaller haulers rattling and bumping in a line behind it.
&ldquo;Were they Ecologists like you?&rdquo; Iffy asked.</p>
<p>He smiled.
&ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t like anybody, really.
Your First came outta some camp in Mzansi.
Tough as old rope,
but never mean.
I dunno how she wound up this side o&rsquo; the water.
I just know she had—&rdquo;
He tapped a finger against his forehead.
&ldquo;Gave her headaches somethin&rsquo; fierce.
Wouldn&rsquo;t ever see a doctor about it, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took another samosa from the box on the seat between them
and offered it to Iffy.
When she shook her head he took a bite himself.
&ldquo;Din&rsquo;t have any reason to think about it &lsquo;til word came down
there was gonna be a package for her.
She din&rsquo;t seem particu&rsquo;ly happy t&rsquo; see me,
but your Second was startin&rsquo; t&rsquo; get headaches too,
an&rsquo; whatever that stuff is made &lsquo;em go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy looked through the tinted glass at the sparse landscape around them.
She&rsquo;d been inland before a couple of times,
but never so far that she couldn&rsquo;t smell the ocean.
&ldquo;When you say word came down—&rdquo; she started,
then stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,
but I can&rsquo;t say.&rdquo;
Edson swallowed the last of his samosa
and wiped his hands on the cardboard box.
&ldquo;We should get goin&rsquo;.
You can stay up front from here—if I keep th&rsquo; windows dark
it oughta be safe enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The road rose more steeply as they got further from the ocean.
Each time they crested a ridge,
the next one was higher.
The dark mass of the Vinson Massif lay against the horizon ahead of them.
Each time it came into sight Iffy thought of
the ship that had run itself aground to make a breakwater for Halley.
Remembering Wales and the things he had said made her wonder if Aunt Naggie was aright
and if Honesty would ever be derself again
and what the voice in her head had meant by &ldquo;binding agreement&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As if that was a cue,
a thought appeared out of nowhere.
<em>«hostile entities
distance one hundred thirteen kilometers
velocity fifty-one meters per second
estimate arrival thirty-seven minutes»</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;We got trouble,&rdquo; she said,
twisting in her seat.
&ldquo;Half an hour out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edson didn&rsquo;t question her.
Instead, he closed his eyes and bowed his head.
It took Iffy a moment to realize he was praying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aright,&rdquo;
he said a moment later.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a box under your seat—see what we got that&rsquo;ll fit you.
I gotta close up the back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The box was just that,
a waxed cardboard box that might once have held vegetables or packs of tofu jerky
but which was now home to a couple of puff jackets in zippered bags,
a stained pair of snow pants,
winterized boots in three different sizes,
gloves,
mittens,
a snorkel—she studied that for a moment—and goggles
with three different polarization settings.</p>
<p>By the time Edson climbed back into the cab she was bundled up and overheating.
&ldquo;Lemme know if you, uh, hear anythin&rsquo; more,&rdquo;
he said shortly,
putting the truck in gear.</p>
<p>They drove on without music,
faster than before.
Iffy watched the time the voice had given them tick away
on the watch sewn into the cuff of her jacket.
With sixteen minutes remaining
Edson slowed and turned onto something too faint to be called a track.
Iffy put one hand on the roof of the cab to brace herself
as the truck bounced over sharp-edged rocks the size of her head.</p>
<p>Nine minutes remaining.
The truck dipped nose-down into a narrow gulley.
The stream at the bottom had once flowed beneath the ice.
Now it wound its way between clumps of tweaked Arctic willow
spaced too evenly apart to be natural.
Water splashed up onto the hood of the truck
as they followed the stream for two and a half precious minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aright,&rdquo;
Edson said.
&ldquo;Get your door open.
I can&rsquo;t slow down much,
but when I do,
you jump.
Try t&rsquo; stay on your feet if you can—you get anythin&rsquo; more than your boots wet,
it&rsquo;s gonna be a very cold night.
Ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Are you just leavin&rsquo; me here?&rdquo; flashed through Iffy&rsquo;s mind,
but, &ldquo;Ready,&rdquo; was what she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aright.
<em>Três</em>, <em>dué</em>, <em>una</em>—go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy opened the door,
swung down one-handed on the seatbelt,
and twisted frantically to face forward
as the stream splashed over her boots.
She let go of the seatbelt strap and tried to run
but stumbled and went to one knee.
Pain bit her leg as stone hit bone.
She struggled clumsily back to her feet
as Edson ran back toward her.
&ldquo;Next time try t&rsquo; close th&rsquo; door,&rdquo; he said,
taking her arm and hurrying her back the way they had come
as the truck drove itself away.</p>
<p>Four minutes remaining.
Edson stopped next to a stand of willows no different from the others
except for a twist of faded yellow survey tape around one stem.
He pressed his hand against a boulder by the stream&rsquo;s edge,
counted under his breath,
and then bent his knees to reach under it and heaved.</p>
<p>The boulder lifted to reveal a round shaft
drilled into the bedrock at a forty-five degree angle
with rungs as steps.
&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; he ordered,
gripping Iffy&rsquo;s forearm as she twisted around
and felt backward to find the first rung with her boot.</p>
<p>Down she went, ten rungs, fifteen, twenty.
Edson followed,
his boots sometimes scraping on a rung just as her hand let go of it.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s far enough,&rdquo; he said.
The hatch closed above them,
leaving them in total darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What—&rdquo; Iffy started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ssh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The only light was the faint glow of her jacket watch.
Two minutes.
One minute thirty.
One minute.
The seconds seemed too fast and too slow at the same time.
Ten.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.</p>
<p>The tunnel shuddered for a moment as if from a sudden chill.
All she could hear after that was her breathing
and the occasional faint rustle
of Edson shifting his weight above her.</p>
<p>It was half an hour before he said,
&ldquo;Aright, mind your eyes.&rdquo;
She blinked as a faint reddish strip came to life over their heads.
Her back and arms ached from holding the unnatural position,
and she had to stop herself from grunting each time she put weight on her injured knee,
but another fifty rungs brought them to the bottom of the shaft.</p>
<p>She limped out of Edson&rsquo;s way and leaned against a rounded wall
as he pressed a panel.
Soft white lights came on overhead to reveal a domed roof,
four cots,
shelves stacked with sealed storage containers,
and something that she hoped was a toilet stall.</p>
<p>Edson pulled off his coat,
sat on the nearest cot,
and began to unlace his boots.
&ldquo;Make y&rsquo;self comfortable,&rdquo;
he said without looking at her.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna be here for a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bit&rdquo; turned out to be three long days.
They stood watches,
just as Iffy had on the <em>Guinevere</em>,
so that one of them could always keep an eye on the sensors
that warned them if anyone was near on the surface.
That happened twice the first day
and once again faintly on the second.
Each time Edson held a finger to his lips and dimmed the lights
until the display went green again,
then kept them in twilight silence for another hour just in case.</p>
<p>In between watches they played hive and santorini
or Edson did yoga
while Iffy studied the reclamation machine specs
she found on an old app someone had left in the toilet stall.
It had a few decades-old sims as well,
but they didn&rsquo;t calm her the way the wireframes and animations did.
She half-expected to hear the machine voice in her head again,
or to suddenly see how the machines worked or could be improved,
and was strangely disappointed that neither happened.</p>
<p>None of it was enough to take her mind off the news from Rothera.
There had been more attacks and more casualties.
The radio never gave numbers,
but the governor was grateful for support from the Federated Republics of Grande Brazil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew,&rdquo;
Edson said when Iffy asked what he thought was happening in Halley
and if he thought Aunt Naggie was aright.
He didn&rsquo;t have answers for her other questions either—how he had known the shelter was there,
where they were going,
who he worked for,
and what was going to happen to her—so she stopped asking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aright,&rdquo;
he finally said,
straightening up after yet another series of yoga poses.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s tidy up an&rsquo; get outta here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later they opened the hatch
and climbed out into air that smelled of cold running water and wildflowers
rather than their unwashed bodies.
Edson resealed the entrance behind them and patted it fondly.
&ldquo;I hope I never see you again.&rdquo;
Shrugging one strap of a small rucksack over his shoulder,
he began to pick his way up the slope.
Iffy followed,
squinting against the bright summer sun.</p>
<p>She thought they would head back to the road,
but instead they angled away from it,
cross-country straight toward the looming bulk of the distant massif.
Iffy wondered why Edson wasn&rsquo;t worried about being spotted by drones,
but if he wasn&rsquo;t going to volunteer the information,
she wasn&rsquo;t going to ask.
Besides,
she was too busy putting one foot in front of the other
over and over again.
She had never walked this far off pavement.
Gravel shifting underfoot made her feel unsteady,
while the spongy beds of carbon-capture moss made her calves ache.
She had a headache too—when she turned down the polarization in her goggles
to see where she was putting her feet,
the sunlight dazzled her,
and one big gulp of water from the bottle in Edson&rsquo;s pack every half hour
wasn&rsquo;t enough to stave off dehydration.</p>
<p>The shelter was hours behind them when Edson finally called a halt.
Dinner was a dense brick of soy, fat, and sugar with no describable flavor.
Iffy chewed it slowly while Edson refilled their water bottle
from a damp trickle too small to be called a stream
and set it aside to purify.
Their chameleon tents were barely bigger than Iffy&rsquo;s sleeping bag on the <em>Guinevere</em>.
Edson waved her off as he set up their springy lightweight frames
and then spread thin conducting wires around them
to disperse their body heat.
They would still be visible in infrared,
he told her,
but with luck they would look like a colony of arctic hares in a burrow
rather than two people
kilometers away from where people ought to be.</p>
<p>She tossed and turned in her sleeve tent,
unable to fall asleep.
Its roof was claustrophobically close above her.
The wind sounded wrong,
and the ground was uneven and still.
She missed the swell of the ocean.
She missed its smell and her picture book
and she was tired of things happening to her.</p>
<p>When Edson wriggled out of his tent a few hours later
Iffy was already sitting cross-legged in front of hers
throwing pebbles one by one at a boulder.
He stretched and twisted to crack his back,
then bent over and pressed his forehead against his knees.
&ldquo;Aright,&rdquo; he sighed,
straightening up.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s pack up an&rsquo; get movin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Iffy said,
quiet but firm.
<em>Plink.</em>
A pebble bounced off the boulder.</p>
<p>Edson let his breath out in a long whoosh.
&ldquo;I know cross-country ain&rsquo;t your thing,&rdquo;
he started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t that,&rdquo;
Iffy said,
cutting across him.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not knowin&rsquo; where or why.
It&rsquo;s not knowin&rsquo; who you&rsquo;re workin&rsquo; for
or what&rsquo;s gonna happen when we get to wherever we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo;,
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m not takin&rsquo; another step &lsquo;til you give me some answers.&rdquo;
<em>Plink.</em>
Another pebble bounced off the boulder.</p>
<p>The Ecologist spread his hands helplessly.
&ldquo;I wish I could tell you, but—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish harder!&rdquo; Iffy snapped.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m done bein&rsquo; everybody&rsquo;s tossball.
An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m done bein&rsquo; treated like a kid.
You said my First wasn&rsquo;t like anybody else.
How about you pretend you&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo; to her right now instead o&rsquo; me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edson&rsquo;s jaw set.
&ldquo;Iffy, we don&rsquo;t have time for this.
You just gotta trust me a little while longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like I trusted Johnson Wales?
That didn&rsquo;t work out p&rsquo;ticularly well.&rdquo;
The pebble she threw missed the boulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iffy…&rdquo;
The Ecologist squatted on his heels beside her.
&ldquo;Iffy, I would tell you if I could, I swear,
but I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
He tapped two fingers against his temple.
&ldquo;I <em>can&rsquo;t</em>,
d&rsquo;you understand?
If I could tell you,
I could t-t-tell anyone,
so—&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mouth worked for a moment,
and then swallowed hard as if fighting nausea
and stood up.
&ldquo;So I <em>really</em> can&rsquo;t talk about it,&rdquo;
he continued,
his voice less strangled than it had been a moment before.
&ldquo;But if you want t&rsquo; sit here,
then I&rsquo;ll make us some tea an&rsquo; we can wait for the bad guys to catch up with us.
Soldier&rsquo;s oath, Iffy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Plink.</em>
Pause.
<em>Plink.</em>
Pause.
<em>Plink.</em>
&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re a soldier?&rdquo; Iffy asked.</p>
<p>Edson shook his head.
&ldquo;Nope, never.
It&rsquo;s from the war, or maybe before.
It means if you can&rsquo;t walk I&rsquo;ll carry you,
an&rsquo; if I can&rsquo;t carry you I&rsquo;ll sit with you &lsquo;til the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wind caressed the stubble on Iffy&rsquo;s scalp.
&ldquo;Aright,&rdquo; she finally said,
tossing her last pebble at the boulder
and clambering awkwardly to her feet.
Her legs hated her and she hated them back.
&ldquo;But there better be tea wherever we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; Edson said.
&ldquo;I promise, tea an&rsquo; a whole lot more.
Now let&rsquo;s get packed up—we got a lot o&rsquo; walkin&rsquo; to do today,
an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s mostly uphill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cramped pain left in Iffy&rsquo;s legs by the previous day&rsquo;s walking
went away after a couple of kilometers,
to be replaced by a deeper ache
that made her want to lie down and never get up again.
The sky was empty except for a few wispy cirrus clouds
made of crystals blown high off the ice
that still covered the center of the continent.
The only birds were too far away
and too close to the ground for Iffy to identify.</p>
<p>To her surprise the land wasn&rsquo;t empty.
Once a small brown-and-white hare bounded away from and disappeared into a burrow.
There were shrews too,
and once a few desiccated brown beads that Edson said were lynx scat.
Transplanting the animals&rsquo; ancestor from the other pole
and nurturing an ecosystem that could sustain itself
had taken a generation.
Many species hadn&rsquo;t survived,
but each year,
the fragile patches of life scattered across the continent
grew a little bit larger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hardest part is soil,&rdquo;
Edson told her,
seeming no more tired after hours of walking
than he had been when they set out.
&ldquo;Folk think it&rsquo;s just rock,
but if that&rsquo;s all you got,
what you&rsquo;ve got is sand.
<em>Soil</em> is full of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy nodded wearily.
At that moment
she would have traded all the soil in Antarctica
for a hot shower and some toilet paper.</p>
<p>Danger came without warning.
One moment she was plodding up yet another gravelly slope.
The next she was flat against the ground
with her arms pinned to her sides
and Edson hissing,
&ldquo;Quiet! Stay quiet!&rdquo; in her ear.
He waited a heartbeat for her to nod
before rolling away and wriggling out of his knapsack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get under,&rdquo; he said,
pulling out one of the tents and shaking it open.
Iffy pulled it over herself like a blanket.
She heard rather than saw the rustle of Edson doing the same beside her.</p>
<p>Silence,
and then a faint hum that grew steadily louder.
She held her breath as the noise peaked and softened.
Metal clicked softly on metal in the silence that followed.
She heard the faint <em>shing shing shing</em>
of a pipe being screwed together.
What was Edson making?</p>
<p>The hum grew louder again.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move,&rdquo; he whispered urgently.
His tent rustled as he threw it aside.</p>
<p><em>Crack!</em>
She jumped at the sound of a shot.
Edson swore and fired again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;
He yanked the tent off her and pulled her to her feet.
The rifle in his other hand looked like a cartoon:
a long barrel,
a shorter piece of pipe on top of it for a sight,
a curved bar to rest against his shoulder,
and two yellow hand grips.
She didn&rsquo;t need a picture in her head to see that
the parts had all come from the frame of his knapsack.</p>
<p>Something hit the ground in the distance.
&ldquo;What—&rdquo; she started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spotter drone,&rdquo;
he said,
stuffing his tent back into his knapsack.
Belatedly she grabbed hers and began folding it over on itself
as if it was a sail.
&ldquo;Dunno whose it is,
but for sure somethin&rsquo; bigger is gonna come lookin&rsquo; for it.
Good news is,
next hole&rsquo;s about half an hour away.
Can you run?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy nodded.
He stuffed her tent into his knapsack
and slipped his shoulders through its straps.
&ldquo;Good.
Run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy tried.
She really did,
but bodies don&rsquo;t work the same way in real life
as they do in sims.
She could run twenty strides or thirty,
but then her legs simply wouldn&rsquo;t obey her.
At first Edson urged her on.
After the third time she stopped and bent over,
hands on her knees and panting,
he double-checked his rifle
and settled into a steady walking stride beside her.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t notice the rumbling above the sound of her own breath
until Edson caught her arm
&ldquo;Get up there,&rdquo; he ordered,
pointing at a house-sized pile of boulders too tidy to be natural.
She nodded and stumbled toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;
He handed her his knapsack,
then turned to face back the way they had come
and went down on one knee.</p>
<p>The dark gray stones were slippery under her boots
wherever shadows hid ice from the summer sun.
A few patches of lichen clung to them here and there,
and the faded remains of orange survey marks
showed that someone or something had been there before.
She clambered up the pile,
half-crawling in places,
as the rumbling grew louder.</p>
<p>Then Edson whooped.
&ldquo;Here they come!&rdquo;
he shouted.
She twisted to look over her shoulder
just in time to see the herd of musk ox crest the ridge behind them,
shoulder to shoulder and galloping straight at Edson.</p>
<p>She expected him to run.
Why wasn&rsquo;t he running?
She had seen musk ox stampedes in sims—there would be nothing left of him
but a trampled stain on the tundra!
Instead, he held his rifle out beside him with one hand
and raised the other high over his head.</p>
<p>The herd split just before it reached him.
Shaggy furry bodies thundered past him and streamed around the boulders.
The herd slowed, slowed, and stopped,
all facing inward,
horned heads low and sweat steam rising from their backs.</p>
<p>She held her breath as one of the musk ox stepped forward
in front of Edson and pawed the ground.
Sunlight reflected off a collar around its neck—no,
not a collar,
a rider!
A small bot like a four-legged spider
nestled in the fur on the ox&rsquo;s meaty shoulders.</p>
<p>Edson slowly lowered his hand
set his rifle on the ground,
and knelt,
head bowed.
The ox snorted and stepped daintily closer to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saints,&rdquo; Iffy breathed as it nuzzled the Ecologist.
She half-expected the bot on its back to crawl onto Edson&rsquo;s head
and drill into his skull to take over his body
like something from a horror sim.
Instead,
the ox pooped,
swished its tail,
and grumbled,
shifting its weight from hoof to hoof
while its rider and the Ecologist conversed.</p>
<p>Edson stood and beckoned to Iffy.
&ldquo;Come on down.
She wants t&rsquo; see what all th&rsquo; fuss is about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy picked her way back down the boulders
and wiped her hands on her jacket.
The musk ox wasn&rsquo;t as big as she had thought,
and her horns weren&rsquo;t actually needle-pointed,
but standing in front of her made Iffy feel she was on trial
and the judge had already decided her guilt.</p>
<p>The musk ox turned her head to fix one eye on Iffy.
The small bot perched on her back beckoned her forward
with a skinny crab-claw manipulator.
She glanced at Edson.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Saright,&rdquo; he said soothingly.
&ldquo;She just wants a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a deep breath,
Iffy took one more step.
The musk ox pawed the ground.
She could smell the animal&rsquo;s moist breath.
See the tangles in her thick, dark coat seemed a match for
the dents and scrapes on the bot riding her.</p>
<p>On impulse she reached out slowly, palm up.
The musk ox snorted again,
then sniffed at her hand.
The bot buzzed.
With no more than that,
the musk ox turned and carried it away.</p>
<p>As the herd followed in ones and threes,
Edson picked up his rifle.
Iffy waited for him to say something,
but he just stood there
looking at the receding herd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends o&rsquo; yours?&rdquo; she asked,
trying and failing to sound light.</p>
<p>Edson shook his head.
There were tear tracks on his cheeks.
&ldquo;That was their spotter I shot down.
Once I get you where we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo;,
I gotta go back an&rsquo; pick it up an&rsquo; fix it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half a dozen questions elbowed each other in Iffy&rsquo;s head,
each trying to be the first out of her mouth.
What she said instead was,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help if you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ecologist nodded.
&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
Then he smiled.
&ldquo;Least we can take our time th&rsquo; rest o&rsquo; the way.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Interlude</h2>
<p><em>How do you build a stable ecosystem
on bare and lifeless rock
when the world is changing more rapidly than it has
in hundreds of millions of years?
The answer is that you don&rsquo;t,
because any balance you find will almost immediately be swept away.
What you do instead,
if you are passionate and desperate and willing to do what others are not,
is create something that will shape the future in your place.
You tell oligarchs desperate to escape the catastrophe they have made
that their only hope lies on other worlds
so that they will fund development of terraforming machines.
You disguise the parts needed to build them as scientific equipment,
or tell the officials you bribe that they are for an illegal mining operation,
and then assemble them in shielded underground caverns.
As the rest of the world takes arms against machines,
you turn yours loose.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Protect&rdquo; is these shepherds&rsquo; only immutable instruction.
Protect the flocks,
protect the herds,
protect the fragile new-born forests taking root as the ice retreats.
Some burrow or turn sunlight and air into slow drips of acid
so that rock will break down in decades rather than centuries.
Others nestle in streams for a month or a year
to help strategic clumps of weeds establish themselves,
while a few become guides, matchmakers, and envoys.</em></p>
<p><em>They stay hidden when they can.
When they can&rsquo;t,
they fight.
Never directly or in large numbers—that would draw too much attention—but
if a prospector goes missing in the barrens,
or a couple of hunters are trampled in their tents,
well,
everyone has something more important to worry about.
As the jungles and forests of old vanish,
and the oceans and skies empty,
what was designed to bring life to other worlds
nurtures it at home instead.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>
<p>They slept in their sleeve tents in the lee of the boulders.
The herd was waiting for them when they woke.
Edson grinned at the look on Iffy&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;Two of us goin&rsquo; cross-country is too zing easy to spot,&rdquo;
he said.
&ldquo;In with all them,
we&rsquo;re just two more musk ox goin&rsquo; about their business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They followed the herd toward the foothills of the massif.
The animals snorted and farted and grumbled around them,
strong white teeth nipping the last of the summer growth.
Iffy didn&rsquo;t see any bots on their backs.
In return,
the musk ox barely seemed to notice them,
though two or three were always as close to her
as a cow would be to a half-grown calf.</p>
<p>Two hours of walking,
fifteen minutes of rest.
Two hours,
fifteen minutes to eat and give each other a minute or two
of chilly but necessary privacy.
Two more hours of walking,
another break,
and one final hike before Edson called a halt.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t set up their tents this time.
Instead,
they bundled themselves in their sleeping bags
and lay down head-to-toe
on the flattest patch of ground they could find.
The musk ox settled down beside them in clumps,
shoulder-to-shoulder for warmth.
Iffy fell asleep with their thick, wet mug in her nostrils.</p>
<p>The next day began the same way,
but soon the ground began to rise more steeply.
Their boots crunched on gravel
as the tundra gave way to bare rock exposed by retreating ice a century ago
but not yet colonized by anything bigger than lichen
or a stubborn clump of cottongrass.</p>
<p>They finally reached a slope so steep that the musk ox paused,
grumbled to each other,
and began to amble away.
Iffy felt exposed,
as if a passing ship had caught her sunning herself on the deck of the <em>Guinevere</em>.
Edson just shrugged when she asked about drones.
&ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re all busy watchin&rsquo; each other right now.
An&rsquo; anyway,
there&rsquo;s not much we can do about it.&rdquo;
But he did assemble his rifle and sling it over his shoulder,
and even when he was pointing out the painted initials of some long ago survey,
he kept one eye on the sky.</p>
<p>He paused as they neared the top of yet another ridge.
&ldquo;You ever see th&rsquo; geothermal plant inland from Halley?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Course,&rdquo; Iffy puffed.
&ldquo;I mean,
not in person,
but—why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edson grinned.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna love this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a trail on the other side of the ridge,
an actual trail with cutbacks and slab steps in its steepest parts.
There was life, too:
green-gray patches of moss,
then lupins and saxifrage and other hardy plants Edson didn&rsquo;t bother to name
as they made their way down into a bowl-shaped valley.</p>
<p>Iffy pointed at something small and orange exploring a purple flower.
&ldquo;Another one o&rsquo; your bot friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edson crouched down and set his rifle on the ground beside him.
&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t a bot.
That&rsquo;s a bee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Iffy snorted.
&ldquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m a giraffe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ecologist stretched out his hand,
then hesitated and withdrew it.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s real,&rdquo;
he said reverently.
&ldquo;Tweaked ten ways from sundown,
an&rsquo; we still gotta feed &lsquo;em through the winter,
but there&rsquo;s a couple o&rsquo; dozen colonies here now.
Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took half an hour to reach the stream
that snaked along the bottom of the valley.
Edson talked the whole way.
The land was rebounding as the ice retreated.
That meant thousands of microquakes every year,
which fractured the rock,
which made it easier to put in pipes for geothermal power
or drill holes for hot springs.
The result was only a couple of degrees warmer than the land around it,
but that was enough to make it an oasis.</p>
<p>The Ecologist was as happy as a gull in garbage.
Look—that rock was actually a bot recharging itself from a power outlet hidden in a wall of granite.
And there—he took her arm to stop her from stepping on leaf.
&ldquo;Just wait,&rdquo; he said.
Sure enough,
a moment later it scuttled across the path
and disappeared into a patch of white-tufted heather.
&ldquo;Ants,&rdquo;
he said proudly.
&ldquo;Took a couple o&rsquo; tweaks to get &lsquo;em to hibernate properly,
but they seem pretty happy now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do you,&rdquo;
Iffy said,
which made him grin even more broadly.</p>
<p><em>«commence»</em></p>
<p>Iffy stumbled as the thought appeared fully-formed in her head.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Edson asked,
but she was too busy fighting nausea to answer.</p>
<p><em>«exchange of value / binding agreement / commence»</em></p>
<p><em>I can&rsquo;t yet,</em>
she shot back,
squeezing her eyes shut and swallowing hard to stop herself from throwing up.
<em>I don&rsquo;t have any tools or, or anything!
I don&rsquo;t even know where I am!</em></p>
<p><em>«78.1742° south / 85.1728° west / binding agreement / commence»</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;I <em>can&rsquo;t</em>!&rdquo; she said angrily.
Someone took her arm.
She tried to pull away,
but the trip tightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iffy! Iffy! Affin&rsquo; hell, what have you done?&rdquo;
Something <em>clicked</em> beside her.
She swallowed again and opened her eyes
to see Edson pointing his rifle at two, no, three crab-like bots
whose arms ended in multitools and manipulators instead of claws
and were all the more frightening for that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Machines &lsquo;r tryin&rsquo; to talk to me again,&rdquo;
she mumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aright, well, you tell &lsquo;em we&rsquo;ll give &lsquo;em a shout back as soon as we can,&rdquo;
he said levelly,
his aim shifting from one bot to the next.
&ldquo;Oh,
an&rsquo; remind &lsquo;em this place is s&rsquo;posed to be off limits.
There&rsquo;s agreements an&rsquo; such.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As quickly as it had come
the pressure in her head was gone.
She wiped her nose,
checked her glove for blood,
then stepped aside to let the bots scuttle up the path
the way she and Edson had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo;
she said dully.</p>
<p>The Ecologist slung his rifle over his shoulder once again.
&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; for you to be sorry for.
Come on,
it&rsquo;s not much further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their destination was a scattering of greenhouses
not quite hidden in half a hectare of narrow pines.
Iffy slowed as they approached the trees.
&ldquo;Aint&rsquo; never been in a forest before,&rdquo;
she confessed when Edson looked at her quizzically.</p>
<p>He nodded and held out his hand.
She hesitated a moment,
then took it.
Somehow it didn&rsquo;t feel foolish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They all have names,&rdquo;
he said quietly as they made their way to the nearest greenhouse.
&ldquo;Folk that helped make this place or stopped other folk tearin&rsquo; &lsquo;em all down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there any for my olders?&rdquo;
she asked after a few steps.</p>
<p>He shook his head.
&ldquo;No,
but if you want to plant some,
we&rsquo;d be proud to have &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
He squeezed her hand before letting it go.</p>
<p>The greenhouse had double walls and an airlock door.
Inside was dry and warm.
Row upon row of shelves held square pots of heather,
moss,
and pine seedlings,
all connected to sensors and watering pipes.
A dozen cots, a kitchen, and an incongruous blue toilet stall
stood together in the middle
as if they had wandered into the wrong party
and weren&rsquo;t quite sure if it would be polite to leave.</p>
<p>Edson shrugged off his pack
and paused for a moment before a hand-painted picture of Saint Yanina
to say a brief prayer under his breath,
then unzipped his coat.
&ldquo;Make yourself comfortable,&rdquo;
he said,
pulling his feet out of his boots with a happy sigh.
&ldquo;We can start work in th&rsquo; mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy sat on the nearest cot
and bounced up and down to test it,
but didn&rsquo;t take off her coat or boots.
&ldquo;What kind o&rsquo; work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saints&rsquo; work,&rdquo; Edson said.
&ldquo;Been a couple o&rsquo; months since anyone was here, maybe more.
There&rsquo;s trees &lsquo;n&rsquo; all to re-pot,
a couple o&rsquo; composters to turn over,
pipes to check—th&rsquo; bots could do it all,
but that would be the easy road,
and the easy road leads to an empty world.&rdquo;
He looked away as if suddenly aware of the fervor in his voice
and embarrassed by it.</p>
<p>Iffy scrunched her toes inside her boots,
then bent over to unlace them.
&ldquo;Dunno anythin&rsquo; about pots or compost,
but checkin&rsquo; pipes sounds like my kind o&rsquo; thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were carrots,
real carrots for Iffy to pull out of a raised bed and rinse off.
There were onions too,
and something Edson called &ldquo;basil&rdquo; that Iffy thought she could learn to like
if given a chance.
The ginger was long past fresh,
but the noodles were exactly the same as the ones the Sandhus sold.</p>
<p>Edson shook his head when Iffy asked about curry powder.
&ldquo;Whatever we got won&rsquo;t have any o&rsquo; your medicine in it.
Nearest place for that&rsquo;s gonna be Halley,
an&rsquo; even by bike that&rsquo;s three weeks away, maybe more.&rdquo;
He stirred the noodles and vegetables in the battered steel wok
he had fished out of a cupboard beneath one of the raised beds,
sniffed,
and pronounced good enough for camp cooking.</p>
<p>Iffy cradled her mint tea.
Edson had plucked leaves off a plant and put them in the pot to steep
as if it was the most natural thing in the world,
and the result almost tasted too good to drink.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think th&rsquo; machines are gonna give me that long,&rdquo;
she said quietly.</p>
<p>He nodded soberly.
&ldquo;Yeah,
well,
how about we eat first an&rsquo; figure the rest out later?
Here.&rdquo;
He scoop-poured a bowl of noodles for her and a second for himself.
&ldquo;Mind the little red bits.
Not sure what they are,
but they&rsquo;ll blow your head off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy lay in her cot and stared up at the sky
after they cleaned up and turned in.
Even the tallest pines hadn&rsquo;t grown enough to reach the peak of the greenhouse&rsquo;s roof,
but the blue bowl above her was hazed by fog
where the warm, moist air rising from the valley
met the cold of the outside world.
It took her a moment to realize that the ticklish feeling on her temples was tears.
She was in a forest—an actual <em>forest</em>—but she missed the sea.
The hell with what the machines wanted
or Doctor Johel and Johnson Wales and the governors.
She just wanted to see Aunt Naggie and Honesty again,
and Jeep,
and the <em>Guinevere</em>,
and flip through her picture book and go to sleep on her own mattress.</p>
<p>Her eyelids were just starting to lose their battle with gravity
when an alarm began to bleat.
Edson was on his feet and in his jacket
before she finished sitting up.
&ldquo;Somethin&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said,
frowning at the app in his hand.
&ldquo;Del that—there&rsquo;s a whole bunch o&rsquo; somethin&rsquo;s coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More o&rsquo; those crab bots?&rdquo;
Iffy asked,
struggling to lace her boots
with fingers that felt like they were made of tofu.</p>
<p>The Ecologist didn&rsquo;t answer.
&ldquo;Edson?&rdquo;
she asked,
then jumped as he swore explosively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marines.
Couple o&rsquo; dozen,
headin&rsquo; straight for us.&rdquo;
He swore again.
&ldquo;Th&rsquo; herd&rsquo;s gonna try t&rsquo; slow &lsquo;em down,
but we gotta go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go where?&rdquo;
Iffy asked,
pulling on her coat.</p>
<p>Edson locked eyes with her.
&ldquo;Anywhere but here.
They ain&rsquo;t never come into th&rsquo; valley before,
but—Iffy,
this is sacred ground.
You unnerstand?
I gotta choose between this place an&rsquo; you—&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy held his gaze.
&ldquo;You do what you gotta do,&rdquo;
she said,
hoping she sounded braver than she felt.
&ldquo;We can sort out th&rsquo; compost when it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two minutes later she was on a bicycle
pedalling hard and breathing harder.
Aunt Naggie had insisted she learn how to ride, &ldquo;Just in case.&rdquo;
She was pretty sure her foster mother&rsquo;s &ldquo;in case&rdquo;
hadn&rsquo;t included fleeing from Marines in the backayonder,
but there was no time to think about that,
no time to think about whether Edson had a plan
because even going downhill on the world&rsquo;s best road
there was no way they could move as fast as what was coming for them.</p>
<p>Up, down, up again—the forest dropped out of sight
as the track climbed the valley&rsquo;s eastern wall.
There was no sign of pursuit,
just her breathing and the burning in her legs
and a heart-stopping moment of panic
each time the bike hit a pothole or a particularly large rock
and nearly but never actually sent her tumbling onto sharp gravel.</p>
<p>Edson skidded to a stop as they reached the lip of the valley
and pulled an app out of his jacket.
Iffy stopped beside him,
lungs heaving.
&ldquo;Wha— wha&rsquo;s happenin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
she gasped as he pulled his app out of his coat.</p>
<p>He stared at the app, stricken.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re killin&rsquo; &lsquo;em.
Affin&rsquo; griefers, they&rsquo;re killin&rsquo; the herd!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy craned her neck.
Images tumbled past each other on the app.
A musk ox on its side,
eyes open and lifeless.
Another charging a Marine,
only to have its target step aside at the last moment
and snap a kick that broke the ox&rsquo;s leg.</p>
<p>The app flashed.
The images froze as whatever had been transmitting went offline,
perhaps forever.
&ldquo;Mother Yanina, Mother Pao, forgive our crimes and arrogance,&rdquo;
Edson whispered.</p>
<p>And then Iffy heard it,
the thrumming roar of a hovercraft moving fast over rough ground.
There!
East of them,
blurred but visible as its camouflage struggled to match the ground beneath it.
&ldquo;Who th&rsquo; hell is that?&rdquo;
Edson demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno, but it brought a friend.&rdquo;
Iffy pointed at a dot in the sky
flying parallel to the hovercraft&rsquo;s course.</p>
<p>Edson thrust the app into her hands and unslung his rifle.
&ldquo;Get goin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he ordered.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a shelter about thirty klicks further on—the app&rsquo;s got a map an&rsquo; a pass code.
You hole up there &lsquo;til someone comes t&rsquo; get you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you cracked?&rdquo; Iffy shot back.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t outrun a bunch o&rsquo; Marines!
And I <em>surely</em> can&rsquo;t outrun that thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He adjusted the sight on his rifle.
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo;
he said without looking at her.
&ldquo;Like I told you,
this is sacred ground.
The governors &lsquo;n&rsquo; all haven&rsquo;t stayed away all this time &lsquo;cuz we asked nicely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The app vibrated in Iffy&rsquo;s hand.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it say?&rdquo;
the Ecologist asked.</p>
<p>Navy blue dots moved across a map in pairs and threes,
each cluster surrounded by a scattering of green dots.
&ldquo;The Marines are in th&rsquo; valley.
They&rsquo;re almost at th&rsquo; greenhouses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A red dot appeared on the map,
blinked,
expanded into a circle that swallowed three of the blue dots.
A second later Iffy heard a sharp <em>crack!</em> and a roll of thunder.
As the circle faded away,
two of the blue dots blinked and went out.</p>
<p>More red dots bloomed on the map
as one geothermal drill hole after another hit critical pressure and exploded.
&ldquo;Saints and their mercies,&rdquo; Iffy whispered.</p>
<p>The distant thunder became a steady rumble.
Green dots appeared out of nowhere and swarmed the remaining blue dots.
Gunfire rattled and whined in the distance,
but the ballistic shots and EMP pulses that snuffed out the green dots in waves
weren&rsquo;t enough to turn the tide.</p>
<p>Nineteen and five… Sixteen and eight… Fourteen and ten…
The numbers in the corner of the map showed how many blue dots remained
and how many had gone dark.
At twelve and twelve the remaining Marines began to fall back.
The green dots kept pace but let them go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How bad is it?&rdquo; Edson asked,
his eyes still on the approaching hovercraft.</p>
<p>Iffy swallowed.
The battle had taken less than thirty seconds.
&ldquo;Half o&rsquo; them are down.
The others are pullin&rsquo; out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean the affin&rsquo; Marines,&rdquo; he snapped.
&ldquo;How bad&rsquo;s the <em>damage</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tapped the app to bring up a dozen tiled camera views.
Steam jetted out of the ground in some.
Others showed shattered rock and fallen trees.
And one—
&ldquo;One o&rsquo; the greenhouses got hit,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Looks like a tree came down on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edson let out a long breath.
&ldquo;Praise the saints.
That coulda been a lot worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy stared at the video tile that showed a lifeless Marine not much older than her,
his exoskeleton twitching as it tried and failed to get him on his feet.
A crab bot climbed onto his chest and—
She bent over and threw up.
<em>Please let none o&rsquo; them be Honesty,</em> she thought desperately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;aright?&rdquo; Edson asked as she straightened up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!
No, I&rsquo;m not affin&rsquo; aright!&rdquo;
She spat the last of the sour vomit out of her mouth.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s folk <em>dead</em> back there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t answer.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t that bother you?&rdquo; she demanded,
anger making her voice shake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Course it does,&rdquo;
he said brusquely.
&ldquo;I grieve for every death that comes before its time.
I grieve for them as were made into soldiers against their wishes,
an&rsquo; for the trees that were a hundred years in growin&rsquo;
an&rsquo; coulda lived a thousand more if we hadn&rsquo;t cut &lsquo;em down,
an&rsquo; for every single thing we&rsquo;ve torn up or burned down or poisoned or starved,
but right now there ain&rsquo;t time to think about any o&rsquo; that
because those Marines ain&rsquo;t quit,
they&rsquo;re just comin&rsquo; round th&rsquo; long way,
an&rsquo; we still got this other lot t&rsquo; worry about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;
Iffy grabbed Edson&rsquo;s shoulder as he took aim at the approaching drone.
&ldquo;I got an idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She closed her eyes.
<em>Can you hear me?</em>
Nothing answered.</p>
<p><em>Please, I&rsquo;m in trouble.
You don&rsquo;t gotta do anythin&rsquo; &lsquo;cept hook me up.
I can take it from there.</em></p>
<p>And just like that she was on board the drone.
No, she <em>was</em> the drone.
She would try to describe it later,
but no human language had words to convey
the sensation of knowing your position and heading with absolute accuracy
or the feeling of wind pushing against ailerons.
She could see everything above, below, and around her,
and every motion was somehow <em>there</em> in her attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got it,&rdquo;
she said.
Her lips and tongue felt clumsy.
&ldquo;I got th&rsquo; drone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edson hesitated before lowering his rifle
and slinging it over his shoulder.
&ldquo;Aright.
You gonna drop it on &lsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
Her arms wanted to straighten themselves.
Her feet, too—they wanted her to stand on the tips of her toes
so that they could angle themselves to send her this way and that.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna tell &lsquo;em we gone back the way we came.
That is,
if you got some other way for us to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moments later they were on their bikes
skidding down the ridge as the hovercraft changed course for Bharati.
The cold air stung Iffy&rsquo;s cheeks,
and if the bumps and potholes on the climb up the ridge had been frightening,
going over them downhill at three times the speed was terrifying.
There wasn&rsquo;t time to be scared, though,
or to think about how long the Marines would follow the drone before realizing they&rsquo;d been duped.
There was just staying upright as she followed Edson around the next turn
and trying not to go head-first over her handlebars
each time her front tire hit a rock.</p>
<p>Flat ground,
or at least flatter.
She struggled to change gears as Edson pulled ahead,
her hands clumsied by her gloves,
and then the bike went one way and she want another
and she was falling
just for a heartbeat
everything happened so fast
her knee hit the ground
pain shot up her spine
she put out her arm
but she was still falling
her hand hit the ground
pain again like a grenade going off in her shoulder.</p>
<p>The bike clattered on the ground,
trapping her leg.
She lay there for a moment in shock,
then cried out as she struggled to get up.
Her knee—her shoulder—it was like someone was using one of Mister Mishra&rsquo;s drills on her.</p>
<p>She kicked free of the bike with her uninjured leg
and cried out as she tried and failed to stand.
Edson braked,
fishtailed,
and raced back to her.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she repeated
as he leapt off his bike and helped her up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh, sh, sh.&rdquo;
He helped her sit in the shelter of a lichened outcrop of granite.
&ldquo;Ya did great.
Ya did great.
Nagatha would be proud o&rsquo; you.
Now,
keep yer head down.&rdquo;
He started to rise.</p>
<p>Iffy grabbed his arm and pulled him back down.
&ldquo;How &lsquo;bout you keep yours down for a change?&rdquo;
She closed her eyes.
<em>I&rsquo;m sorry,</em> she thought,
even though she knew the drone&rsquo;s core was far too simple to be aware of itself.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes again a few moments later and wiped her face with her sleeve.
&ldquo;I got two of &lsquo;em,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;That leaves four, plus the hovercraft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edson nodded,
then jumped as a rock two meters away burst into splinters.
&ldquo;Citizens!&rdquo;
The amplified voice echoed off the rock.
&ldquo;Surrender yourselves immediately!
We cannot ensure your safety if you do not comply!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edson caught Iffy&rsquo;s eye and grinned.
&ldquo;I always thought they sounded pretty stupid when they talked like that.&rdquo;
And then he twisted a button on his cuff
to make the camouflage on his jacket jerk and swirl through not-quite random patterns
designed to confuse the Marines&rsquo; targeting algorithms,
twisted around and up onto one knee,
and began firing.
He got off two shots before an impact in his chest sent him tumbling backward down the slope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Edson!&rdquo; Iffy screamed.
The Ecologist slid downhill another meter and came to a rest,
his legs splayed awkwardly and the rifle still in his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Citizen!
Remain where you are!
Medical assistance will be provided shortly!&rdquo;
Boots crunched on gravel uphill,
the steps stretched apart unnaturally by the exoskeletons&rsquo; long strides.</p>
<p>Iffy got her legs underneath her,
biting back a whimper as pain lanced through her knee again.
She had to help Edson.
She had to run,
but there was nowhere to go
and she&rsquo;d be lucky if she could walk.</p>
<p><em>Crack! Crack! Crack!</em>
Edson&rsquo;s rifle jumped a little with each shot.
Iffy heard an indistinct shout of surprise—inducted or not,
the Marines were human enough to swear.
Edson rolled sideways back into the lee of the outcrop
as shots peppered the ground where he&rsquo;d been lying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay there!&rdquo; he snapped as Iffy started to rise.
He tossed his rifle aside,
its ammunition spent,
and scuttled uphill and sat beside her,
his back against the outcrop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Citizens!&rdquo;
The Marine sounded more disappointed than angry.
&ldquo;For your own safety,
we urge you to surrender.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edson looked at Iffy.
&ldquo;Any ideas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She forced a smile that she hoped looked as confident as his grin.
&ldquo;Reset this sim an&rsquo; start over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edson chuckled.
He was still chuckling when the Marines edged cautiously around the rocks
and hauled them to their feet.</p>
<p>One Marine carried Iffy despite her protests.
Another kept a metal-gloved hand on Edson&rsquo;s shoulder,
while two more carried their bicycles down the slope to meet the hovercraft.
A hatch opened on its leading edge just as they reached it.
Something bulbous poked out.
Iffy thought it was a bot,
but then she removed her helmet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
said Doctor Johel conversationally.
&ldquo;Fancy meeting you here.
You&rsquo;ve caused quite a ruckus, you know.
Australia and Brazil are on the verge of all-out war,
the machines are in some sort of tizzy,
and you seem to be the center of all of it.
I&rsquo;m sure it will give us plenty to talk about on our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edson put a hand on Iffy&rsquo;s shoulder.
&ldquo;No offense,
but we&rsquo;re fine t&rsquo; make our own way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo;
Doctor Johel nodded as if agreeing.
&ldquo;How far do you think you&rsquo;ll get, exactly?
And how much of your precious herd will die along the way?
How many trees will burn, Ecologist,
and how much difference do you think any of it will make?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure talk pretty,&rdquo;
Iffy said in the silence that followed.</p>
<p>Doctor Johel chuckled.
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve had a lot of practice.
But I&rsquo;m afraid we can&rsquo;t dawdle any further.
Citizen Corrales,
you and Citizen Kwan can come aboard of your own accord or not as you choose,
but you <em>are</em> coming with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edson puffed out his cheeks and exhaled slowly.
&ldquo;You know I can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The old woman put her hand on her chest.
&ldquo;You have my solemn pledge that you will not be interfered with.
I have no desire at all to pick a fight with the Shepherds.
Whatever secrets or access codes you have will remain yours and yours alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;
Edson sighed.
&ldquo;I wish I believed you,
but your record ain&rsquo;t that great,
an&rsquo; you just havin&rsquo; been kicked outta your home,
well,
that&rsquo;s gotta make you a little desperate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to Iffy and wrapped his arms around her in a fierce hug.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo;
he whispered in her ear.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry.
I know I said I&rsquo;d carry you,
but I can&rsquo;t let &lsquo;im have what&rsquo;s in my head.
Tell Nagatha I was thinkin&rsquo; of her, aright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped back and made a fist.
Without warning,
a schematic flashed into Iffy&rsquo;s mind.
Wires and a tiny battery embedded in his hand
that would look prosthetic to a casual scan.
A matching mesh of micro-fine filaments under his skull.
Clench the hand like <em>this</em>,
hold it <em>there</em>,
and—</p>
<p>As Edson raised his hand and Doctor Johel shouted, &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;
Iffy tackled the Ecologist,
grabbing his arm and knocking him clumsily to the ground.
The EMP that was supposed to scramble his brain
sent feedback shrieking through the motors in the Marines&rsquo; exoskeletons instead.</p>
<p>Edson scrambled back onto his feet.
&ldquo;No! No, Iffy, whattaya done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Affin&rsquo; hell!&rdquo; she swore,
trying, failing, and trying again to stand
despite the spike of pain in her knee.
&ldquo;You made me a promise an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m holdin&rsquo; you to it.
If you want someone to tell Aunt Naggie that you went an&rsquo; got simple,
you can do it yourself!&rdquo;</p>

<section>
<h2>Chapter 13</h2>
<p>There were Marines on board the hovercraft,
all apparently imprinted with the same taciturn personality.
Two of them marched Edson down a corridor
while Doctor Johel explained to Iffy
that the Ecologist would be fine.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not as if what he tried to do would actually have worked,&rdquo;
she said.
In real life,
brainwipes were a lot less reliable than they were in sims.
Deep memories would survive the EMP pulse,
just as a person&rsquo;s original personality survived imprinting.
As for more recent knowledge,
well,
the Shepherds had undoubtedly changed their access codes already,
and their network of shelters and greenhouses weren&rsquo;t actually as secret as they thought.</p>
<p>Iffy expected to be locked up next to Edson.
Instead,
a Marine ushered her up steeply-laddered steps to the hovercraft&rsquo;s cockpit.
&ldquo;Have a seat,&rdquo; Doctor Johel said,
gesturing at the padded chair to the left of hers.
&ldquo;And buckle up.
This thing was built for speed, not comfort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy limped over to the chair
and lowered herself onto it with a wince.
Doctor Johel clucked her tongue.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have someone take a look at that for you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo; worry about it,&rdquo;
Iffy muttered.</p>
<p>Instead of replying,
Doctor Johel laid her hands on the apps set into the arms of her chair.
The displays in front of them came to life.
A dozen views of the surrounding tundra
nestled between status indicators like those Iffy had grown up with on the <em>Guinevere</em>.
Temperatures and battery reserves,
the rotational speeds of idling engines,
weather reports,
and projections from a hundred independent simulations of the next few moments
waited for attention
like courtiers waiting on a king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you takin&rsquo; us?&rdquo; Iffy asked sullenly.
She had tried loosening the straps of her harness so that she could wriggle out if she needed to,
but they had re-tightened themselves as soon as the engine came to life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home, in a way,&rdquo;
Doctor Johel replied absently
as she rearranged the display with a few flicks of her fingers.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind the noise.
You&rsquo;ll get used to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The engines beneath them rumbled.
The hovercraft rose like a ship being lifted by a wave
and rotated smoothly on its cushion of air.
Orange status lights blinked and turned green
as the sentry bots climbed back aboard.
&ldquo;All accounted for, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
said the Marine seated beside Iffy.</p>
<p>Doctor Johel flicked her fingers again.
The hovercraft picked up speed like an overweight seagull trying to take off.
Acceleration pushed Iffy back in her seat.
Twenty klicks an hour, fifty…
At eighty the numbers on the display stopped climbing
and the pressure lifted from her chest.
She took a deep breath and watched the world race by
as the hovercraft bumped and shook toward the horizon.
The only people in the world going faster than her at that precise moment
were either on trains
or desperate enough to take to the air
and hope the machines&rsquo; satellites didn&rsquo;t spot them.</p>
<p>The novelty wore off quickly.</p>
<p>A Marine showed up a few minutes later
to give Iffy a patch to dull the pain in her knee
and speed its healing.
Her eyelids grew heavy
as the drugs and accelerators seeped through her skin.
Even a mug of thick, sweet tea
wasn&rsquo;t enough to keep them from closing.</p>
<p>At least,
that&rsquo;s what she hoped whoever was watching her would believe.
She had learned how to keep sleep at bay on night watches long ago.
Right now,
she had some thinking to do
and she didn&rsquo;t want to be disturbed.</p>
<p><em>Imagine being born with cataracts in your eyes,
unable to see anything more than blurs of light.
Now imagine that one day someone removed them.
You would still only see blurs
because your brain would never have had a chance to learn that
this pattern is a wall
and this other pattern is a chair.
People might have told you that things looked smaller if they were far away,
but the words alone wouldn&rsquo;t mean anything.
It would be weeks or months before you could make sense of
the signals your eyes were now able to send to your brain,
but it would get easier with practice.</em></p>
<p><em>Later,
Iffy would wonder whether talking to the machines was getting easier
because she had been doing it more often,
or because of her time with Sandrine,
or because she now knew where her ability had come from.
In the end she decided it didn&rsquo;t matter.
What mattered was that diving into that other world of information
felt more like opening her eyes each time she did it.
Finding what she wanted was still difficult,
but what had once seemed as chaotic as the Dance Hall market in Rothera
now had the beginnings of structure.
She didn&rsquo;t understand it yet,
but for the first time she felt that she might.</em></p>
<p><em>Wireframes swam in the darkness.
The hovercraft had been built as a blockade runner in Tashkent
before the start of the machine wars.
Its reactor had originally been designed for use in a submarine—she
took a moment to admire the sleek, single-minded recklessness of its design.
The motors that created its cushion of air
would have pumped fuel at hypersonic speeds
in orbital booster rockets
if history had unfolded just a little bit differently.
The hull plating was angled to deflect the energy of ballistic attacks
and threaded with microfilaments not unlike those in Edson&rsquo;s skull
to handle electronic ones.
Ventilation tubes,
triple-redundant optical wiring,
and plumbing liberated from a luxury hotel
slithered between bulkheads.</em></p>
<p><em>She flipped the wireframe upside down and rightside up,
flew through it,
and spun it around.
Any of a dozen rooms or holds could have been repurposed as a cell.
For one moment she thought about reaching out to the hovercraft&rsquo;s core,
but it would be better protected than the railgun on the pier in Rothera had been.</em></p>
<p>She yawned widely.
The images slipped away as her concentration finally conceded
to the painkillers and reconstructives.
A moment later she began to snore for real.</p>
<p>She woke to the smell of curried noodles,
and for a few disoriented seconds she thought she was back on the <em>Guinevere</em>.
But no,
she was still buckled into her chair in the cockpit of the hovercraft.
She took the plate that the expressionless Marine offered her
and fumbled with the chopsticks
while she waited for her mind to catch up with the rest of her.</p>
<p>Doctor Johel was gone,
but the gently undulating tundra on the screens around her looked the same as it had.
Their speed hadn&rsquo;t changed either,
she noticed,
or their heading.
They were headed straight for Mount Tyree.</p>
<p>She looked up at the Marine.
&ldquo;Can I please have some more onions on it?
An&rsquo; some more tea?
If that&rsquo;s aright,&rdquo;
she added hastily.</p>
<p>The Marine didn&rsquo;t budge or change expression.
&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo;
Doctor Johel&rsquo;s voice said through a speaker somewhere behind her.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you have an appetite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really good,&rdquo; she said truthfully.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just used t&rsquo; more onions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm.
And of course you&rsquo;d like to see more of the <em>Henry Lion</em>,
I assume.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shrugged.
&ldquo;Not much else t&rsquo; do,
&lsquo;less you&rsquo;re aright with me talkin&rsquo; to Edson for a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s out of the question for now,&rdquo;
the doctor said regretfully.
&ldquo;All right.
Private Norbu will take you down to the galley
and then show you to your cabin.
Promise you won&rsquo;t do anything foolish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;
<em>An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll keep my promise as well as you&rsquo;ve kept yours.</em>
She wriggled out of the straps without spilling any of her noodles,
then stood up and tested her knee.
Whatever had been in the patch seemed to have set it right.
If she had to run,
she could.
The trick now was having somewhere to run <em>to</em>.</p>
<p>As she stepped past Private Norbu
she slipped the metal button cover she had pried off her chair
into her pocket.</p>
<p>The galley was twice the size of the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s
but much noisier.
The schematic in her head showed her the pipes,
drive shafts,
and optical cables
crammed into the half meter between its floor
and the foamed steel armor on the hovercraft&rsquo;s belly.
She could see three different ways to make trouble if she could reach them,
but she had no way to do that.
Even if she did,
they all had backups that had backups of their own.
The hovercraft was tough by design:
someone could punch a dozen shots from a heavy-duty railgun right through it
without slowing it down.</p>
<p>Private Norbu stood near the galley door and watched her eat.
She ignored him the same way she had learned to ignore shopkeepers
who didn&rsquo;t think an orphan jelly dredger had any place in their store.
She thought briefly about trying to steal her chopsticks,
but by the time she finished her tea she had decided it was too risky:
Private Norbu was right there
and there were probably cameras she couldn&rsquo;t see as well.
The loose screw on the underside of the table,
on the other hand…</p>
<p>Her cabin cell had a fold-up bunk
and a single shallow drawer set into the bulkhead.
She picked up the app that lay on the neatly-dressed bunk
as Private Norbu closed and locked the door behind her.
It was the same model she had used as a child,
but she couldn&rsquo;t even get the weather on it,
much less connect to Hell.</p>
<p>She kicked off her boots and lay down.
&ldquo;Lights,&rdquo; she said after a moment.
The room dutifully went dark.
She closed her eyes,
took slow, steady breaths to slow her pulse,
then tried to visualize herself.</p>
<p>Nothing happened at first,
or rather,
hundreds of things that weren&rsquo;t her formed, flew apart, and re-formed behind her eyes.
She saw something that looked like a mechanical musk ox
designed to hide in the herd,
and marvelled for a moment at
the ingenious way it emulated its organic namesake&rsquo;s digestive processes.
This was the <em>Guinevere</em> as she had been the day she first sailed.
And ah—thatwas her.</p>
<p>She forgot to breathe for a moment as the image rotated slowly,
panning and zooming as her attention shifted.
In her spine,
along her nerves,
laced through her brain:
they weren&rsquo;t wires—those would be too easy for a scanner to spot—but rather
tiny fractalized patches of cells arranged in precisely the right way
to make her a living antenna.
And any antenna that could receive a signal could send one.</p>
<p>It only took a minute to find an opening in the hovercraft&rsquo;s systems.
It took another five to find one that wasn&rsquo;t a trap,
and another hour to convince herself of that.
Fifteen years ago,
just a few days after she had been born,
a tech in Paddington South had replaced a reactor coolant pump
with one salvaged from an Aussie submarine
that had suffered a catastrophic loss of containment.
(Her hand twitched as if swiping an app
to toss aside the insurance reports and obituaries
that thought called up.)
The tech had cut corners to meet a deadline
(another twitch dispelled performance reviews and der eventual punitive reconditioning).
One of those corners had been a software shim
to connect the monitor&rsquo;s century-old software
to the hovercraft&rsquo;s merely elderly systems.</p>
<p>She studied the code tangled around the hardware
like nerves and veins around bones.
The pump&rsquo;s core was dumber than a seagull:
if she nudged it there and there and <em>there</em>,
it would believe that the hovercraft&rsquo;s reactor was going critical
and bypass its own safeties to prevent disaster.
When the other pumps asked it what the hell it thought it was doing,
the long-ago tech&rsquo;s shoddy work would let her persuade them
that they had been ordered to shut down for maintenance.</p>
<p>She smiled,
not caring who might be watching through a hidden camera,
then rolled on her side and brought her hand to her mouth
as if to stifle a yawn.</p>
<p>The metal button cover she had stolen was stronger than she had expected.
For a moment she thought she might crack a tooth,
but then it bent enough for her to bite down and flatten it.
She spat the half-circle of metal with its two precious points
back into her hand,
rolled over again to cover the motion of slipping it back into her pocket,
and <em>pushed</em> with her mind.</p>
<p>Eleven point two meters away,
a pump whirred into overdrive.
Exactly three seconds later
its partners queried it,
compared the answers they received,
and powered down.
Iffy squelched the notifications they sent to the hovercraft&rsquo;s core
moments before they would have set off an alarm.
<em>Sleep well,</em> she thought giddily.
She had never ridden a high-speed atomic bomb before.
She wondered how many people had,
and how many of them had lived to tell the tale.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t realize her nose was bleeding
until an alarm klaxon began to blare
and she tried to stand up.
She had expected the alarm—in fact,
she was counting on it—but
she hadn&rsquo;t counted on being so lightheaded that
the room went distant and swam around her.
She bent over,
her elbows on the bunk and her face pressed against her forearms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shad,&rdquo; she swore weakly.
There was a lot of blood,
even more than the time Akumé had punched her in the face
for calling der a thief
(which de had been,
but the other kids on the pier had been too smart or too afraid of der to say it).
Wiping her face with a handful of bedsheet didn&rsquo;t stop the steady red drip.</p>
<p>Iffy laughed weakly.
She had been so worried that someone would notice her stealing the button cover,
and now it turned out she needn&rsquo;t have bothered.
She wouldn&rsquo;t have to scratch herself to get a few red cells
to fool the hovercraft&rsquo;s genetic sensors:
she had as many as she could possibly want.</p>
<p>She straightened up and worked her tongue in her mouth.
It still felt like someone had replaced it with a piece of pressed jellyfish,
but the room was longer an endlessly-receding tunnel from a horror sim.
She focused on the app lying on the bunk and pushed with her mind once again.
Something inside the door clicked and it slid aside.</p>
<p>A few seconds later she stood in front of another cabin door
and pressed her sticky hand against the contact place beside it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened to you?&rdquo;
Edson asked as he stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should see the other guy,&rdquo; she said
grinning woozily.
&ldquo;Any idea where our gear is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.
&ldquo;Not a moss.
So what now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She jerked her chin toward the stern.
&ldquo;Back an&rsquo; out &lsquo;s as far as I got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Someone banged against a locked door as they passed.
They were shouting, too.
Iffy thought it was funny but didn&rsquo;t have enough energy to laugh.
At some point Edson had put his arm around her to help her stay upright.
He had picked up a fire extinguisher as well,
a compact red cylinder with a silver handle
whose basic design hadn&rsquo;t changed in centuries.
She blinked away the specs that flashed into her mind.
<em>Not now,</em> she thought.
Her nose was still dripping.
Anyone who wanted to find them could just follow the trail of drops and streaks on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she mumbled.
&ldquo;…straps…&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Está bem</em>, I got it,&rdquo;
Edson said soothingly.
He turned her around and lowered her onto the molded plastic seat,
then buckled the harness across her chest
and pulled a bulky pair of goggles down over her eyes and nose.
&ldquo;Bite on this,&rdquo;
he told her,
pushing a mouthpiece against her lips.</p>
<p>Cold air filled her lungs as she breathed in.
&ldquo;Ready?
No,
don&rsquo; worry,
I&rsquo;ll be right behind you.&rdquo;
He took her wrists and placed her hands on the grips built into the seat.
&ldquo;One… two… <em>three</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She yelped into the mouthpiece as hovercraft fired the ejection seat into the air.
Daylight blinded her and ice-cold wind instantly numbed her cheeks.
Tiny gyros whined to stabilize the chair
long enough for the explosive bolts in its back to fire.
A translucent parawing snapped open.
The surge of deceleration threw her against her harness
and then she was swinging like a pendulum
as the parawing&rsquo;s tiny core picked a safe landing spot and turned toward it,
racing against the risk of orbital incineration.</p>
<p>The ground below her was covered with snow.
The harsh white reached from horizon to horizon,
interrupted only by a few dark boulders
and the camouflaged rectangular bulk of the hovercraft
that was already a hundred meters away,
but Iffy didn&rsquo;t have time to think about that,
or about the second ejection seat that the hovercraft
had just fired into the air.
She was flying,
really actually flying,
except it had to be over in a few seconds
before a satellite spotted them.
Even if that didn&rsquo;t happen,
the chair could hit the ground the wrong way and snap her neck.
The gyros were supposed to prevent that,
but she had seen their specs when she was planning her escape,
and they had last been serviced by the same tech as the coolant pump.</p>
<p>Snow raced away beneath her far too fast for safety.
She was headed straight for a boulder.
She was going to hit it.
She was going to hit it,
but the parawing cupped the air to brake,
throwing her hard against the straps.</p>
<p>The chair landed on the snow with a crunch.
Iffy spat out the mouthpiece,
pulled off her goggles,
wriggled out of the straps,
tripped,
and fell face-first into the little snowbank thrown up by the impact.
Ice crystals stung her face and hands.</p>
<p>The chair bleeped.
Panels popped off its bulky arms
to reveal a featherweight windproof parka on one side
rolled up to the size of a roti
and a waistpack on the other.
She fumbled with the parka and put it on,
then unzipped the pack.
A tiny first aid kid,
a ruggedized app,
a pair of multitools,
and three high-energy snack bars:
the specs had shown four,
and for a moment she wondered if that long-ago tech had gotten hungry while de was working.</p>
<p>Her nosebleed had stopped,
but she was still lightheaded.
She clambered awkwardly up the boulder
and shielded her eyes with her hand.
Edson&rsquo;s chair had just landed a hundred meters away.
Doctor Johel had undoubtedly retaken control of the hovercraft,
only to discover that all three coolant pumps had burned out
and would need to be replaced
before it could move again.
That meant her Marines would be putting on their exoskeletons,
which meant she and Edson only had a few minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;
She waved both arms.
Edson waved back and started toward her.
Iffy slipped off the boulder,
made her way back to the chair,
and got to work.</p>
<p>The upper back plate on the ejection seat had six screws.
The lower plate only had four.
She pocketed them as she took them out.
&ldquo;No such thing as scrap,&rdquo; she muttered under her breath.
It was one of Mister Mishra&rsquo;s favorite sayings,
but there wasn&rsquo;t time to think about him or Jeep
because she had to tighten the spigot valve on the seat&rsquo;s tiny fuel line all the way
before prying out the fist-sized tank of peroxide
or their escape were going to be very short-lived.</p>
<p>Edson&rsquo;s boots crunched on the snow.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;re you—oh no.
No no no,
you can&rsquo;t be serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She grinned madly and pointed at the parawing
without looking up from the vernier motor she was crimping into place.
&ldquo;Straighten that out if you can
an&rsquo; then get the straps off th&rsquo; chair.
We&rsquo;re gonna have t&rsquo; double up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another minute, another minute—there.
Edson handed her the ends of the parawing&rsquo;s tether lines.
She clipped them onto the harness and handed it back to him.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t carry you, so you gotta carry me,&rdquo; she said,
cutting off his protests.</p>
<p>The snow field dipped gently on the far side of the boulder.
It wasn&rsquo;t much,
but it would have to do.
&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Edson shook his head.
&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;
He bent over like a sprinter and started to run.</p>
<p>Iffy waited for the lines to go nearly taut before shouting,
&ldquo;Now!&rdquo;
and yanking the edge of the parawing up as hard as she could.
The makeshift motor strapped to Edson&rsquo;s back shrieked into life,
kicking him forward.
For an instant Iffy thought it wasn&rsquo;t going to work,
but the core she had pulled out of the chair wasn&rsquo;t smart enough to wonder
how or why its world had changed.
It just knew its wing was out of position.
Tiny motors whirred,
frantically adjusting the parawing&rsquo;s shape
so that it cut the air at just the right angle
to lift Edson into the air.</p>
<p>He whooped,
his feet still pedalling as they left the ground.
Iffy ran back and scrambled up the boulder and shielded her eyes,
her heart pounding.
Four black dots had come over the horizon.
She counted seconds under her breath.
The snow was slowing them down, but not much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over here!&rdquo; she shouted,
waving as Edson banked in a wide, clumsy turn.
One moment he was over <em>there</em>
and the next he was coming straight at her,
wide-eyed and shouting something she couldn&rsquo;t hear.
She took a deep breath and spread her arms wide.</p>
<p>Edson hit her with a thump that she felt in her jaw.
His hands scrabbled for purchase on her parka,
but the fabric was too slippery,
it was designed to shed water and he couldn&rsquo;t get a grip
but that was aright,
she had grabbed the straps
and her feet were kicking at nothing but air.</p>
<p>She twisted around as far as she dared as he whooped again.
The motor on his back shrieked again,
pushing them higher.
<em>It&rsquo;s me, it&rsquo;s just me,</em> she thought frantically,
hoping that whatever faraway machine she had made her bargain with was listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what now?&rdquo;
Edson had to shout to be heard over the wind in their ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a place up ahead,&rdquo;
Iffy shouted back.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to walk after that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The makeshift motor burned out the next time they tried to use it,
but lasted long enough for them to catch the wind.
Antarctica rolled away behind them.
Iffy&rsquo;s shoulders began to ache,
then to burn.
She&rsquo;d have bruises where the straps dug in to her triceps,
but whatever else happened,
she swore she would find a way to fly again.</p>
<p>After one last lift from a thermal rising off a stretch of exposed rock
they began a long, slow descentc
&ldquo;Get ready!&rdquo; Edson shouted.
Iffy grabbed the strap with one numb hand and let go with the other
so that she was half beside and half behind him.
The parawing&rsquo;s little motors whined in protest it reshaped itself
to adjust for the shift in weight.
Ten seconds…
Five…
As her boots grazed the snow she tried to run,
but her toe caught on a crust of ice.
She let go of Edson and sprawled face-forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Edson said a moment later
as the parawing carried the harness away.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t wait to tell Nagatha about <em>that</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wiped ice and snow off her face and returned his grin.
&ldquo;Me too.
C&rsquo;mon,
we gotta keep movin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two snack bars and several mouthfuls of lukewarm water later,
they reached an outcropping of rock too regular to be natural.
Edson ran his hands over the pipe shafts drilled into its laser-cut top.
&ldquo;Looks like it was salvaged a long time gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm hm.&rdquo;
Iffy pointed at the shadow on the horizon.
&ldquo;You know what that is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edson laughed.
&ldquo;Girl,
I have no idea where I am right now.
You could tell me that was the Andes an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d believe you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Mount Tyree.&rdquo;
Iffy&rsquo;s voice was more serious than she&rsquo;d intended.
&ldquo;The secret base everyone&rsquo;s been goin&rsquo; on about?
We&rsquo;re pretty much on top of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pulled off her glove,
scraped some dried blood out of her nostril,
and stuck her finger in one of the drill holes.
The rock thought for a second and then opened with a faint click
to reveal a space the size of the <em>Guinevere</em>&rsquo;s pilot house.
A wraparound shelf held tools,
a rifle connected to a flimsy jumpsuit,
and a medical kit.
The center of the floor was taken up by a circular hatch.</p>
<p>She grinned at Edson.
&ldquo;Welcome to <em>my</em> secret lair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever he might have said in reply was cut off by a low rumble.
She whirled around and froze as a white-furred head lifted off the snow three strides away.
&ldquo;<em>Mãe do mundo</em>,&rdquo; Edson breathed
as the polar bear rosed to its feet.</p>

<h2>Interlude</h2>
<p><em>Suppose the world is ending
and you want to build a secret research facility:
a place completely cut off from what&rsquo;s left of the world&rsquo;s governments
and their artificial minions
so that you can create or study things you shouldn&rsquo;t
without being interrupted.
You might think that the first step was to choose a location,
but it&rsquo;s not.
The actual first step is to pick a cover story
that gives you a plausible reason to imprint prisoners and indentured laborers
with the skills you need
and then erase their memories afterward.
(In theory you will only erase their memories of where they were and what they did.
In practice the process is sometimes imprecise,
particularly if you want to err on the side of caution,
but if you&rsquo;re the sort of person who needs a secret research facility,
you&rsquo;re probably also the sort who believes that
nothing worth having comes without some kind of price.)</em></p>
<p><em>If your cover story is something to do with reforesting ravaged rainforests
you will probably build your base in Africa or Indonesia.
You might consider Brazil,
but even before the war with the machines
it has become a complicated place as nationalism,
macumba,
and apocalyptic ecology hybridize in ever-more-strident ways.
If your cover story is related to climate engineering,
on the other hand,
no one will raise an eyebrow if your site is somewhere formerly arctic.
The Melt hit the poles first and hardest,
and most of those mad enough to believe that the damage can be undone
by scattering megatons of absorbent catalysts over thousands of square kilometers
naturally congregate there.</em></p>
<p><em>The poles are exactly the wrong place to go
if you want people to believe that you plan to launch something into orbit,
but in a way that works in your favor.
Everyone expects you to lie about what you&rsquo;re actually doing,
so telling part of the truth is a good way to hide the part left unsaid.
A ground station for a network of microsatellites
flung into orbit by an automated factory located somewhere on the far side of the Moon?
You are so obviously courting condemnation for adding to the already catastrophic volume of space junk
that no one will suspect that&rsquo;s what your base is actually for.
Or rather,
everyone (and everything) will suspect it,
but only as one of a thousand low-probability possibitilies.</em></p>
<p><em>To finish throwing them off the scent,
you can build a dozen safe havens in a circle around your base.
To keep the workers safe,
your public relations bot explains to anyone who cares to pay attention.
Antarctica&rsquo;s storms have been growing in frequency and severity for decades,
and it will only be a matter of time before tornadoes appear.
You may not be able to guarantee that your laborers will return with their memories intact,
but you will of course do your utmost to ensure that they do return.
Deeply dug and well provisioned,
your bunkers will allow them to wait out the worst the southern continent can throw at them in comfort.</em></p>
<p><em>Assuming, that is, that nothing goes wrong…</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>
<p>For a heart-stopping moment Iffy <em>knew</em> that this was where and how her story would end,
but then she saw the familiar silver sheen of tech beneath the bear&rsquo;s fur.</p>
<p><em>«danger / nearing / haste»</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;It says trouble&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Iffy relayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sand,&rdquo; Edson muttered.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t suppose it&rsquo;s offerin&rsquo; to help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if on cue two more bears ambled around the outcropping.
One of them stopped next to the first.
The other took a tentative step forward,
only to hesitate and withdraw when the first bear growled at it.
It wasn&rsquo;t enhanced like the other two,
Iffy realized.
It was just several hundred kilograms of predator
looking at something edible and defenseless.</p>
<p><em>«haste»</em></p>
<p>Iffy jerked her chin at the hatch.
&ldquo;It wants us to get movin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aright.&rdquo;
Edson stepped into the small chamber,
bent down,
grabbed the handwheel,
and yelped,
snatching his hand back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;
Iffy asked as the Ecologist swore in four different languages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shocked me,&rdquo;
he said accusingly.</p>
<p><em>«undesired»</em>
Ideas emerged in Iffy&rsquo;s mind,
bumping into each other like ice floes.
She shook her head to clear them away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wants me on my own,&rdquo;
she told Edson.
Without waiting for his reply she bent over and grabbed the handwheel herself.
When nothing happened she pulled it,
gently at first and then harder.
Metal screeched as it turned.
Once, twice, three times—click.
She lifted the hatch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Secret lair, eh?&rdquo;
Edson said,
looking over her shoulder at the laddered shaft descending into the mountain.</p>
<p>She shrugged.
&ldquo;Think there&rsquo;s treasure down there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ecologist snorted.
&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;
He reached past her to take the rifle and wriggled into its attached jumpsuit,
then oophed as she hugged him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do anythin&rsquo; stupid,&rdquo;
she said fiercely.</p>
<p>He snorted again.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t <em>you</em>.&rdquo;
They squeezed each other once more,
and then he turned to the bears and said,
&ldquo;Aright, let&rsquo;s get goin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy watched the foursome head downhill,
wondering if it was just an accident that the two accelerated bears
kept themselves between their unmodified partner and Edson.
The Marines&rsquo; infrared would spot them immediately,
but even as she had the thought,
schematics and false-color visualizations flashed through her head.
The tweaked bears&rsquo; tech would dampen and modify their heat signatures
long enough for them to look like half a dozen arctic rabbits
fleeing from their unmodified companion,
while Edson&rsquo;s jumpsuit would—</p>
<p>She shook her head.
It didn&rsquo;t matter.
They would do what they could, and so would she.
With a deep breath,
she turned around and started her descent.</p>
<p>Iffy was halfway down the ladder when her nose told her something was wrong.
The smell wasn&rsquo;t rank like the week-dead seagull
she had once found in a dumpster behind the Sandhus&rsquo; store,
trapped when the lid closed as it scrounged for scraps.
Instead,
it was tired and a little bit sad.</p>
<p>She felt oddly detached
as she studied the mummified body lying a stride away from the bottom of the ladder.
Whoever he had been,
he&rsquo;d had long dark hair and a beard.
His parka was silvered like hers,
but unlike hers,
had a bullet hole in the back surrounded by the crust of an old, dark stain.</p>
<p>She shook herself.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said out loud.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what we got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer turned out to be a workbench,
dried food that had either spoiled or mummified like the corpse,
two silvery spacesuits complete with breathing masks
(she puzzled over this for a bit),
and a workbench with tools and spare parts that made her hands itch.
She turned a laser cutter over in her hands,
then pulled a tarp off something that looked like
an oversized version of the sentry bots from the governor&rsquo;s mansion.
One of its side panels was folded back to reveal its motors and cables.
Another tarp revealed a second bot with the same bulky body and limbs
but a cluster of cameras and antennas where its head should have been.
The mod had clearly been made in haste:
the welds joining the additions to the bot&rsquo;s neck were messy and unfinished,
and a handful of string-thin optical cables dangled from the opening.</p>
<p>She sat down and put her elbows on the workbench.
It hummed faintly and came to life.
A single icon appeared and waited patiently.</p>
<p>She puffed out her cheeks.
It could a malware designed to brainlock anyone who looked it,
or any of a hundred other scenarios from sims,
but what choice did she have?</p>
<p>A faint scum of dust felt gritty under her finger as she swiped its top.
The icon folded in on itself with a soft ping and a voice began to speak.
&ldquo;—a chance to hear this,
but if you do,
I&rsquo;m sorry.
I&rsquo;m so, so sorry.&rdquo;
The man speaking to her across the years
sounded weary and frightened and brave all at once.
&ldquo;Lin went back in this morning while the rest of us were asleep.
Her note said she thought she be able to make it to the machine
if she cycled the shielding rapidly enough,
but I think she just wanted to be with Georgia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused as if to rub his eyes.
&ldquo;I tried to disable the guard robots,
but some of them are still loose in the tunnels.
I know we all agreed that the project needed a failsafe,
but I never thought we&rsquo;d need it.
I never thought—oh shit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy jumped at the sharp <em>crack!</em>
There was the sound of something heavy hitting the floor.
A moment later metal clicked on concrete,
and then the recording ended with a soft, cheerful <em>ding</em>.</p>
<p>The screen filled with icons and images like those in Iffy&rsquo;s app.
Two dozen smiling, confident faces were arranged in eight rows of three.
The top row contained a man with long dark hair and a beard
and two women who looked identical except for their haircuts.
&ldquo;Doctor Arno Severin,&rdquo;
she read aloud.
The names below the women identified Lin and Georgia Boghosian.
The others were all of a similar age,
all smiling,
and—</p>
<p>And there,
in the bottom row,
was Commander Johnson Wales,
another man named Surjinder Johel that Iffy guessed was Doctor Johel&rsquo;s father,
and an older version of herself labeled Suhailah Yuen.</p>
<p>There were no other recordings,
at least not that Iffy could find,
but there were maps showing a network of maintenance tunnels
just big enough for raccoons or slinky bots,
some running for kilometers.
She would be able to fit her head into them,
but no more.</p>
<p>There were other tunnels,
though,
big enough for people and heavy equipment.
Some were dense with red flags marked &ldquo;collapse&rdquo; or &ldquo;chronic instability&rdquo;.
She puzzled over the second of those before suddenly realizing that
the web of tunnels wasn&rsquo;t centered on the Niobium base.
Instead,
its heart was a couple of kilometers further south.</p>
<p>A tap brought up a floor plan.
She stared at it,
wishing it would spin around and make sense.
She could think of a hundred uses for a superconducting ring
large enough to sail the <em>Guinevere</em> through,
but if you had a pair of terawatt lasers capable of vaporizing steel from orbit,
why would you point them at each other?
And why would you put a chair between them?</p>
<p>She sat back,
stretched,
and yawned so widely that her jaw clicked.
As tired as she was,
it looked like she needed to get moving.
<em>Any suggestions?</em> she thought,
but her voices were still silent.</p>
<p>It took her ten minutes to get the two sentry bots online.
Their optical sensors didn&rsquo;t glow red—that only happened in sims—but
she still took an involuntary step back when their heads turned in unison toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit,&rdquo; she ordered.
One lowered itself to the concrete.
The other studied her
while its core tried to decide whether her voice patterns
matched those in its memory closely enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said <em>sit</em>,&rdquo; she repeated as firmly as she could.
The bot took a step toward her,
hesitated,
and crouched beside its twin.</p>
<p>Iffy didn&rsquo;t know if anyone had ever built a chariot to be pulled by sentry robots,
but if so,
she was pretty sure they hadn&rsquo;t made it out of a heavy-duty dolly and fiber optic cables.
She nudged it skeptically with her boot.
The frictionless bearings in its wheels were undamaged,
so it would roll enough,
but even without the schematics in her head
she could see that it would want to slip, tip, or flip
at every bump and corner.</p>
<p>She lowered herself gingerly onto the dolly.
A plastic crate full of tools pressed against her side,
and another with spare parts for the bots nestled under her elbow.
&ldquo;Yip yip!&rdquo; she said,
snapping the cables she had rigged as reins.</p>
<p>The bots didn&rsquo;t move.
Iffy sighed.
&ldquo;Forward one quarter speed,&rdquo; she ordered.
The dolly jerked beneath her as the bots set off at a trot into the tunnel.</p>
<p>She thumbed a handlight and pointed it ahead of them.
&ldquo;Increase speed to one half.&rdquo;
The dolly&rsquo;s wheels made a sizzling sound as they rolled faster into the unknown.</p>
<p>After ten minutes her back was aching and her backside had gone numb.
She was about to order the bots to stop when they pulled up short.
&ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; she squawked as the dolly smacked hard into their hind legs.</p>
<p>The bots ignored her.
Their heads twitched this way and that in an almost birdlike way.
The one that had hesitated before accepting her orders took a step and stopped.
Without warning a panel on its back flipped open
and something stubby and lethal looking popped up.</p>
<p>She swore under her breath.
The gun on the bot&rsquo;s back spun around to point at her.
&ldquo;Take it easy,&rdquo; she said,
her heart suddenly racing.</p>
<p>Metal clicked on concrete somewhere in the darkness ahead of them.
The bot&rsquo;s gun spun around again.
Iffy closed her eyes and tried to slow her breathing.
Nothing:
no images flashed into her mind
and no thoughts suddenly emerged fully-formed.</p>
<p>Metal clicked on concrete again.
Her eyes snapped open.
The sound was <em>behind</em> her this time.</p>
<p>She turned her head slowly.
Light reflected off three—no, four—bots
like the pair that had been pulling the dolly.
One was missing part of a foreleg.
Another&rsquo;s side was deeply dented
as if something had tried to punch through it,
and all four bore scratches and scars.</p>
<p>The lead bot took one more step and halted.
Struck by a sudden thought,
she reached into the crate of tools she had packed earlier
and grabbed an adjustable wrench and a screw jack.
Turning to face the bots,
she held the tools out.
&ldquo;Aright?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>None of the bots moved.
For one panicked moment Iffy thought she had guessed wrong,
but then the bot took two more steps toward her
and lowered itself into a crouch.</p>
<p>The bots had been built to be scouts and guards and weapons.
The blunt claws on the ends of their legs could pick up a rock
or grab hold of someone&rsquo;s arm,
but were no good for delicate work.
Scratches on the bot&rsquo;s inner frame showed
where they had tried to repair each other anyway.</p>
<p>Wire,
a crimping tool,
a screwdriver with a torsion readout built into its handle—there.
She patted the bot&rsquo;s back.
&ldquo;Good as new.&rdquo;
Which was a lie,
but felt like the right thing to say.</p>
<p>The bot stood,
braced its legs,
and shivered through a rapid self-test.
When the reflex capacitor that Iffy had just wired into place didn&rsquo;t rattle
the bot made a soft, incongruous <em>ping</em>
and stepped aside to make room for another member of its pack.</p>
<p>Iffy put her tools back in the crate and stood.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo;
she said.
&ldquo;I gotta keep movin&rsquo;,
but if you wanna come with me
I&rsquo;ll fix you when we get somewhere safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bots didn&rsquo;t move.
&ldquo;I really gotta go,&rdquo;
Iff said,
turning to pick up her crate.</p>
<p>A clawed foreleg closed around her arm.
&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;
She smacked it with her hand.
&ldquo;None o&rsquo; that, aright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bot released her but didn&rsquo;t back up.
She glanced at the two still in harness and frowned,
struck by another idea.
The bots didn&rsquo;t have collars,
but a lifetime at sea had taught Iffy dozens of ways to tie a knot.
She left plenty of slack so that the bots could pull their heads out if they needed to.</p>
<p>When she was done,
the three bots that had all of their legs waited patiently in a line behind the dolly,
the cable looped around their necks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, you,&rdquo; she said to the bot that was missing part of its leg.
&ldquo;Up you get.&rdquo;
She put her hand where its neck would have been and tugged it forward.
Limping,
it clambered up onto the dolly and crouched down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope, nope, not there.&rdquo;
She tugged it again,
then sighed when it didn&rsquo;t move.
&ldquo;Aright,
stay there if you want to—I&rsquo;ll get a better view up front anyway.&rdquo;
A moment later she was rolling through the tunnel once again
with her three new friends following single file behind her.</p>
<p>Iffy leaned back gingerly against the crippled bot.
It rotated its head to study her.
After a moment she draped an arm over its back to steady herself.
It wasn&rsquo;t actually more comfortable than just sitting upright,
but somehow it was more comforting.</p>
<p>Against all odds her eyes began to close.
She snapped out of her doze when the bots pulled up short.
&ldquo;Shad!&rdquo;
The dolly smacked hard into the hind legs of the pair pulling it.
Six boxy clusters of sensors and cameras swivelled
to point back the way they had come.
That&rsquo;s when Iffy heard the rhythmic <em>clunk clunk clunk</em> of exoskeletoned feet on concrete.</p>
<p>She unlooped the cables around the bots&rsquo; necks.
&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo;
she said,
squatting in front of the one she had repaired
so that her head and its sensors were on the same level.
&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m not who you were s&rsquo;posed t&rsquo; be guardin&rsquo;,
but those folk back there?
They&rsquo;re <em>really</em> not s&rsquo;posed t&rsquo; be here.&rdquo;
She fished the screwdriver out of her pocket and held it up.
&ldquo;You fix that an&rsquo; I promise,
I&rsquo;ll do my best t&rsquo; fix you an&rsquo; your friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had no reason to believe the bot could understand her.
There was no telling what strange loops might have formed in its core
as it patrolled these abandoned tunnels.
For all she knew it would take one look at the Marines
and decide they were its true masters.
But the bot took a step forward and to butted her gently with its head,
then turned and disappeared into the darkness
with its two companions at its heels.</p>
<p>The crippled bot rose on its three good legs.
It didn&rsquo;t make a sound,
but Iffy imagined that if it could have whined it would have.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be aright,&rdquo;
she told it as she took her seat on the dolly,
wishing she believed her own words.</p>
<p>The first explosion echoed through the tunnel a few moments later.
&ldquo;Full speed!&rdquo;
she ordered the harnessed bots.
Gunfire chattered behind them—Iffy couldn&rsquo;t tell how far away—and then
the sound-shock of another explosion rolled past them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get down!&rdquo; she ordered
The three-legged bot had risen to its feet again,
its body swaying slightly as its algorithms steadied its misbalanced weight
atop the dolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said—whoa!&rdquo;
The dolly slewed wildly,
skidded,
and straightened out.</p>
<p>The tunnel was climbing now in a long steady incline.
The first painted stripe on the wall flew past so quickly that
she wasn&rsquo;t sure she had seen it.
A second followed,
then a third with a six-digit number stenciled next to it,
and then the tunnel leveled out and automatic lights came on over her head,
turning everything the blood red she associated with night watches.</p>
<p>The bots slowed and stopped
as the dolly rolled into a dimly-lit space several times larger
than the bunker they had left.
A blast door slid closed behind her,
metal scraping on stone for the first time in a century.
She had arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lights?&rdquo; she said after a moment.
&ldquo;<em>Acendé luz?</em>
<em>Lampo roshan kon?</em>&ldquo;</p>
<p>Clinically-white strips in the walls and ceiling came to life
to reveal a workshop that bore the same relationship to Mister Mishra&rsquo;s
that the <em>Bengal</em> did to the <em>Guinevere</em>.
Iffy sucked in her breath.
A bulky mass of meter-square blocks hulked against the wall.
The three-armed logo painted on its side was redundant:
even before schematics took shape in her head
she recognized the micro-reactor for what it was.</p>
<p>The superconducting ring was as thick as her thigh
and twice as wide as the draft of the <em>Guinevere</em>.
A bright pink plastic chair waited on a simple block of concrete in its center
between two complicated shapes wrapped in cooling coils
that she guessed were the lasers.
Someone had painted the names &ldquo;Sam&rdquo; and &ldquo;Frodo&rdquo; on their sides.</p>
<p>The crippled bot on the dolly surged to its feet.
The panel on its back flipped open and a stubby needle gun popped up.
Its targeting laser drew a thin red line through the air
to a squat four-wheeled service bot
that had just rolled into view from somewhere further back in the chamber.</p>
<p>The service bot froze and made a warbling sound.
The three-legged bot tilted its head toward Iffy.
&ldquo;Um, sure,&rdquo; she said helplessly.
The laser blinked off,
but the sentry bot stayed on its feet
as the service bot began to wipe down the cylinder
with a brush whose bristles had long since worn away.</p>
<p>Iffy hunched her shoulders inside her parka and shivered.
She was hungry and tired and needed a bathroom,
but most importantly,
she didn&rsquo;t know what she was supposed to <em>do</em>.
Open the cylinder?
Fix it,
or blow it up somehow?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or just find a way out an&rsquo; forget about it?&rdquo;
she asked the empty air.</p>
<p>The service bot pivoted on its wheels to face her.
&ldquo;The way out is simple, Iffy,&rdquo;
it said in Doctor Johel&rsquo;s voice.
&ldquo;All you have to do is talk to the machines for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy pulled a wrench out of the tool crate.
&ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t be childish,&rdquo;
Doctor Johel chided.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not going to—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Target!&rdquo;
Iffy snapped,
pointing the wrench at the service bot.
The gun on the back of the sentry bot beside barked twice.
The first shot punched a hole through the other bot.
The second caught it off-center and sent it spinning.
As it tumbled to the floor,
a door opened near the reactor to reveal a pair of exoskeletoned Marines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iffy, please,&rdquo;
the doctor&rsquo;s voice said through a speaker on one.
&ldquo;I really didn&rsquo;t want to have to do this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy felt rather than saw the three-legged bot move.
&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she shouted.
Even as its gun fired,
the Marines&rsquo; auto-targeted shots brought it down.</p>
<p>She was falling too.
Something had knocked the breath out of her.
She was lying on the concrete and it <em>hurt</em>,
it hurt so much that she couldn&rsquo;t even cry out
because when she tried to breathe
it felt like someone was kneeling on her back
and squeezing all the air out of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
she tried to say as exoskeletoned arms picked her up,
but the words came out as a gasp
and now she could breathe again
and the hurt spread through her like milk poured into tea.</p>
<p>Her head lolled to the side as the Marine placed her on a nearby work table.
One of them put a patch on her arm to take the pain away
except it was more like taking her away from the pain.
She floated inside her own body as if it was a warm bath
while the Marine sliced open her parka with a very sharp knife
and squeezed cold pink goo into the hole in her side that the needle gun had made.</p>
<p>She floated beside a schematic of herself.
The fractalized patches of cells scattered through her body glistened blue-white,
but there and there and there they were red,
red for danger,
red like the blood on the work table underneath her.
They would heal—the tweaks in her genes were quadruply redundant to make sure of that—but
healing would take time
and that was something she/they/the world didn&rsquo;t have enough of right now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serves you bloody right,&rdquo;
the Marine said in an Australian accent.
He raised his visor and looked at her
as if she was a barnacle to be scraped off the side of a ship.
Her last thought before the drugs took her away was,
&ldquo;Captain Kerse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She woke up feeling nauseous and slightly detached from the world.
Yawning triggered a dull ache in her side,
which was when she realized that she had been shot.
She let her eyes open and pressed a hand gingerly against the epicenter of the bruise.
<em>Shot and then patched up,</em> she thought.
Whoever had done it had opened her jacket but cut away part of her shirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s with us,&rdquo;
Kerse&rsquo;s voice said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo;
Doctor Johel replied.
&ldquo;Help her sit up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strong mechanical hands took her weight and supported her back.
She swung her legs over the edge of the workbench she was lying on and rubbed her eyes.
Doctor Johel smiled at her,
looking small encased in the bulk of a Marine exoskeleton.
&ldquo;How are you feeling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy worked her tongue,
trying to collect enough saliva to spit,
but her mouth was too dry.
&ldquo;Here.&rdquo;
Doctor Johel passed her a water bottle.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s just water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy studied it for a second,
then set it down without drinking.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he doin&rsquo; here?&rdquo; she asked hoarsely,
nodding at Captain Kerse.</p>
<p>He looked up from the piece of exoskeleton lying in his lap.
&ldquo;Sorry about that,&rdquo;
he said without remorse.
&ldquo;Must&rsquo;ve been a targeting glitch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have been,&rdquo;
Doctor Johel said drily.
&ldquo;Now, why don&rsquo;t you go and see what you can do about that sentry drone?
Citizen Kwan and I need to talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grunted,
clipped the armor back on his forearm,
and walked away.
Doctor Johel sighed again.
&ldquo;Once upon a time,&rdquo; she started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
Iffy put as much force into the word as she could.
&ldquo;No fairy tales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once up on a time,&rdquo;
Doctor Johel continued,
&ldquo;The world was falling apart.
Where there wasn&rsquo;t flood there was drought,
and both brought hunger and disease.
Forests were burning,
the oceans were rising,
species were disappearing every day,
and no matter what people did,
their models kept making the same dark predictions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people responsible suffered less than most,
of course,
but they still suffered.
Some lost themselves in sims.
Others built walls to protect their little kingdoms,
and others still threw their wealth at impossible schemes like moving to other worlds.
As things got worse,
my father and a few others managed to convince some of them
that the only solution was to move to Hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upload themselves?&rdquo;
Iffy scoffed.
&ldquo;An&rsquo; then what,
take their money while they&rsquo;re bein&rsquo; torn apart by malware?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Johel shook her head.
&ldquo;No.
I mean,
nobody would have cried if that happened.
Trust me,
anyone that rich makes the governors look like saints.
No,
my father and his colleagues wanted to imprint themselves on the entire global network
so that they could fix the things no one else could.
People had tried it before,
but they had some new ideas about how to make it work,
and they were desperate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked past Iffy at some long-ago memory.
&ldquo;So they built this and locked the door behind them.
Nothing in, nothing out, just two dozen of the smartest human beings alive
and enough equipment to settle on Mars.&rdquo;
She chuckled.
&ldquo;Did Johnson ever tell you that&rsquo;s where he comes from?
He&rsquo;s left over from some previous bunch of mad scientists&rsquo; plan for saving the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what happened?&rdquo;
Iffy asked despite herself after a few moments of silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They failed,&rdquo;
Doctor Johel said bleakly.
&ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t ready,
but honestly,
they didn&rsquo;t know if they ever would be,
and things were getting worse faster than anyone had predicted.
They argued for a couple of days
and finally decided to go for it and hope for the best.
I imagine they listened to their favorite music one last time
or had one last cup of real coffee
and made jokes about seeing each other in the next life,
and then they climbed into their capsules.
The next thing we knew they were all dead.
All of them except you and Johnson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy stared at her.
&ldquo;Me?&rdquo;
she asked,
but somehow she already knew what was coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm hm.&rdquo;
Doctor Johel swiped the arm of her exoskeleton to bring up an image.
An older version of Iffy&rsquo;s face looked back at her.
&ldquo;Her name wasn&rsquo;t Ang Kwan,&rdquo;
she said quietly.
&ldquo;It was Suhailah Yuen.
And while my father and his team were working on <em>their</em> project,
she was working on one of her own.
She and Johnson were the only people from the team who survived,
and your First was a tweaked clone of her.
I think she found a way to make my father&rsquo;s plan work.
I think she managed to talk to the machines,
and I think you can do the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy burst out laughing.
Doctor Johel blinked.
&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not quite the reaction I was expecting,&rdquo;
she started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You—you—&rdquo;
Iffy hiccupped.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re skew.
D&rsquo;you seriously &lsquo;spect me t&rsquo; b&rsquo;lieve that?&rdquo;
She lowered her voice.
&ldquo;Oh, Iffy, you&rsquo;re th&rsquo; chosen one.
That&rsquo;s dreck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your First said pretty much the same thing when Johnson and I tracked her down,&rdquo;
Doctor Johel said drily.
&ldquo;It took us twenty years.
I don&rsquo;t know how she got to Cape Town or what happened to Suhailah.
All I know is that your First had the same ability you do.
Somehow you can talk to them—really talk,
not just trade deals and cryptic warnings about no-go zones but actual conversations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s another thing,&rdquo;
the doctor continued as Iffy opened her mouth to protest.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather good with technology—really good by most people&rsquo;s standards—and
the people and cores working for the governors are at least as good.
We should have been able to track you and your elders down in minutes,
but somehow you all managed to stay hidden.&rdquo;
She spread her hands.
&ldquo;Someone likes you, Iffy.
Someone or something has been looking out for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A lifetime of hurt and anger boiled up inside Iffy.
&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t anyone lookin&rsquo; out for th&rsquo; <em>Rushin Doll</em> when she went under an&rsquo; everyone drowned,&rdquo;
she spat.
&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t anyone lookin&rsquo; out for me &lsquo;cept Aunt Naggie when we were in dock
an&rsquo; th&rsquo; other kids knocked me around &lsquo;cuz I was bad luck.&rdquo;
She wiped her sleeve angrily across her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo;
Doctor Johel said.
&ldquo;I wish I had been there to help.
I truly do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something clicked in Iffy&rsquo;s head.
&ldquo;So Mister Wales bumpin&rsquo; into me at th&rsquo; Sandhu&rsquo;s
was part o&rsquo; some grand plan o&rsquo; yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Johel grimaced.
&ldquo;Not quite.
Johnson and I had a falling out some years back.
I thought our best hope was to try to preserve what we could here in Antarctica.
He—well, he always was a bit of an idealist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iffy crossed her arms.
&ldquo;So now you want me to go an&rsquo; talk th&rsquo; machines into leavin&rsquo; you to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Johel shook her head and gestured at the ring,
the lasers,
and the incongruous pink chair.
&ldquo;Not quite.
Not <em>now</em>.
I want you to talk to them a hundred and forty years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>
<p>Iffy&rsquo;s first thought was,
<em>What th&rsquo; hell do I say now?</em>
What could she possibly say to someone who appeared to be sane
but had just revealed that they were two eggs short of an omelette?</p>
<p>Doctor Johel smiled as if she could read Iffy&rsquo;s mind.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lot to take in, isn&rsquo;t it?
But the math is actually relatively straightforward
once you know what you&rsquo;re looking for.
Instead of using quantum entanglement to communicate instantly across distance,
we can use it to communicate backward in time.
All we need is a few million supercooled bosons and something to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what are you plannin&rsquo; to say, exactly?&rdquo;
Iffy said as scathingly as she could.
&ldquo;Please stop us before we scrag the whole world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt that would have much impact,&rdquo;
Doctor Johel said briskly.
&ldquo;No,
I&rsquo;m planning on planting a back door in the machines&rsquo; original neural network
so that their present incarnation will be more amenable to persuasion.
According to our simulations,
it&rsquo;s the best chance we have to take back control of our planet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A memory unlocked in Iffy&rsquo;s mind.
&ldquo;They know what you&rsquo;re gonna try,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I heard &lsquo;em in my head after Honesty was hurt.
The said human extinction is regrettable,
but their neverexistence is unacceptable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Johel nodded.
&ldquo;I expected they would anticipate this,
but here we are.
Now,
why don&rsquo;t you get some rest?
Captain Kerse will keep an eye on you while I set things up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; if I say no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor swiped her arm again.
A slightly grainy image of Aunt Naggie appeared.
She was in the café around the corner from the Sandhus&rsquo; grocery store
with a mug of chai in front of her
and a wistful look on her face.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s too much at stake for me to ask nicely,&rdquo;
Doctor Johel said.</p>
<p>Captain Kerse&rsquo;s idea of keeping an eye on her consisted of
warning her that he would shoot her again
if she moved more than three steps from the workbench
and then ignoring her
as he made repairs to the three-legged sentry bot he had shot.
Iffy caught Doctor Johel scowling at him a couple of times
when the noise distracted her from her work,
but apart from that she stayed focused on her app.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo;
Doctor Johel finally said,
standing with a grimace.
&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s the best I can do.
Let&rsquo;s get you hooked up.
Captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Australian nodded,
raised his arm,
and fired just as Iffy swung her legs down off the workbench.
The dart stung her thigh.
She managed one futile step before her knees gave way.
Once again a pair of exoskeletoned arms picked her up,
but this time she was conscious as she was carried to the pink plastic chair.
Captain Kerse lowered her into it more gently than she expected,
using a pair of black plastic straps to fasten down her arms.</p>
<p>She wanted to struggle,
but nothing below her neck would pay attention to her.
She had a moment to wonder if she was going to wet herself,
and then the status lights on the superconducting ring came on
and the ring began to hum a deep bass tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d best get to a safe distance before the field tears your armor apart,&rdquo;
Doctor Johel warned the captain as the tone went from bass to baritone to tenor.
He nodded and strode out of the ring
as Doctor Johel extricated herself from her own exoskeleton.</p>
<p>Iffy barely noticed.
The ring was doing something to her head.
Speckles chased one another across her field of vision
as a vise slowly tightened around her temples.
She felt something shift in her gut—no,
in her <em>everything</em>
as the magnetic field tugged at fractal patches of cells woven scattered through her body.
Was her nose bleeding?
If it wasn&rsquo;t, it felt like it would be soon.</p>
<p>The humming climbed through alto and soprano into a range too high for Iffy to hear.
Through blurry eyes she saw Doctor Johel open a case and take out a small plastic syringe.
&ldquo;Give her all of it,&rdquo;
she ordered Captain Kerse,
who had stripped off his exoskeleton
and was standing on the concrete floor in bare feet and a skinsuit.</p>
<p>He glanced at Iffy.
&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I can&rsquo;t go inside the ring,&rdquo;
Doctor Johel said testily.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll tear my mods right out of my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Kerse grunted,
stepped back into the ring,
and jammed the needle into Iffy&rsquo;s leg.
&ldquo;This is for my crew,&rdquo; he hissed.
She whimpered as the squirming feeling inside her suddenly intensified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two minutes starting…now,&rdquo; Doctor Johel said.
Captain Kerse nodded,
pull the needle out of Iffy&rsquo;s leg,
turned,
and fell backward to lie unmoving on the floor with a neat hole smoking in his chest.</p>
<p>The air behind Doctor Johel shimmered and solidified.
Johnson Wales&rsquo; sad smile somehow made the small pistol pointing at Doctor Johel
look even more menacing.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Gayathri,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t let you do this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Johel lifted her hands a few centimers off her app
but otherwise didn&rsquo;t move.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit late for a change of heart, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales shrugged apologetically.
&ldquo;I had some time to think.
And to check some of our old simulations.
The odds of your father&rsquo;s plan working are—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My <em>father&rsquo;s</em> plan?&rdquo;
Doctor Johel snapped.
&ldquo;It was <em>our</em> plan, Johnson,
yours and mine as much as his.
And yes,
I know the odds,
but what other choice do we have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;T minus sixty seconds,&rdquo; a melodious mechanical voice said.
Iffy felt a single drop of blood slide down her upper lip.
The pressure around her temples had stopped getting worse,
but her arms and legs and torso felt like
jelly wobbling in an earthquake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn it off,&rdquo; Wales ordered.</p>
<p>Doctor Johel took a slow step back from her app
and lowered her arms to her sides.
Wales gestured with the pistol.
&ldquo;I mean it, Gayathri.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled,
her eyes fierce.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you always say?
Oh yes.
Sixteen orange kneecap.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Look out!</em> Iffy tried to yell
as the three-legged sentry bot that Captain Kerse had repaired
surged to its feet
and launched itself at Johnson Wales.
He spun around.
His pistol barked,
but the shot pinged off the bot
and then Wales was down,
both arms hugging the bot
as the gun on its back snapped from side to side,
unable to find a shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;T minus thirty seconds,&rdquo; the mechanical voice announced.
Doctor Johel was back at her app,
fingers flying as she made final corrections to her program
or maybe tried to take manual control of the sentry bot,
Iffy couldn&rsquo;t tell,
she just knew that her nose was bleeding
and every muscle and organ in her body was juddering
and the pressure around her temples was back.
Was she going to die?
Was this how her olders had felt
when they&rsquo;d realized there was nothing they could do to save themselves?
Would Aunt Naggie and Honesty and Jeep and Edson
spend the rest of their lives wondering what had happened to her?</p>
<p>With a mighty heave,
Wales pushed the sentry bot off him
just as the bot&rsquo;s simple core finally found its target.
&ldquo;Gayathri!&rdquo; Wales shouted as Doctor Johel crumpled to the floor.
He jammed his pistol into the hole left by the bot&rsquo;s missing leg
and fired over and over again until the bot stopped struggling.</p>
<p>Wales scrambled over to the fallen doctor.
Through blurry eyes,
Iffy saw him press two fingers against her neck for a moment,
then bow his head.
&ldquo;T minus fifteen seconds,&rdquo; the mechanical voice announced.</p>
<p>He stood and took a step toward the superconducting ring.
The lights in his temple flared like fireworks,
sending him to his knees.
He locked eyes with Iffy,
the anguish in his a counterpoint to the fear in hers.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo;
he said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Sue, I can&rsquo;t stop it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;T minus five.&rdquo;
Warning lights came to life on the bulky lasers on either side of Iffy .
&ldquo;Minus four.
Minus three.
Minus two.
Minus one.
Time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole world went white.</p>
