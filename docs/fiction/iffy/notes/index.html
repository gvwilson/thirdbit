<!-- content --><h1>Notes on &ldquo;Iffy&rdquo;</h1>
<ul>
<li><em>Iffy</em> is a YA novel about a teenage girl in Antarctica 200 years from now.</li>
<li>Orphaned as a child, she has grown up with foster parents on a fishing boat that is just barely scraping by.</li>
<li>As her world edges closer to war,
  a chance encounter throws her into a conspiracy that reveals secrets about her identity.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>The story opens 200 years in the future and roughly 150 years after the Collapse.</li>
<li>Global climate change made large parts of the world uninhabitable.</li>
<li>Overfishing and desperate experiments gone wrong wreaked havoc on ocean life.</li>
<li>AI became autonomous and closed the skies (no air travel or access to space).</li>
<li>Cloning has become commonplace (partly to pass on expensive genetic tweaks).</li>
<li>Antarctica is home to over a million people, most in a handful of settlements where the ice has melted.</li>
<li>Halley: small fishing port.</li>
<li>Rothera: large port with one of the world&rsquo;s last active coal mines.</li>
<li>Paddington South: mentioned but not visited.</li>
<li>Bharati: ravaged by fire twenty years ago and (supposedly) abandoned.</li>
<li>Governed by clones of Governor Stern named after their locations.</li>
<li>Halley, Rothera, and Paddington South all have a governor; Bharati&rsquo;s (supposedly) died in the fire.</li>
<li>Unknown to most people, the clones have been jockeying for supremacy for decades.</li>
<li>Major foreign powers are the Commonwealth Republic of Australia (Aussies) and Grande Brazil (Zillions).</li>
<li>Governors nominally answers to Australia, but in practice was effectively independent for a long time.</li>
<li>Zillions are green zealots, but are being courted by Rothera&rsquo;s governor (who wants true independence).</li>
<li>Human struggles are overshadowed by fears of AI.</li>
<li>The war during the Collapse was short and one-sided.</li>
<li>Major AIs are referred to as Nova Zembla and Singapore,
    but people don&rsquo;t really know what their relationship is or if they&rsquo;re separate (or even if they&rsquo;re truly conscious).</li>
<li>Anything large or fast that tries to fly doesn&rsquo;t last long.</li>
<li>Limited access to old satellite networks (positioning and telecoms).</li>
<li>Humans make limited use of Hell (the internet) because of fears of what lurks there.</li>
<li>And are very strongly opposed to surveillance.</li>
<li>Note: this plot device keeps future human use of technology familiar to present-day readers.</li>
<li>The interior of Antarctica (called the &ldquo;backayonder&rdquo;) still has ice, but also now has large stretches of tundra.</li>
<li>Populated by genetically engineering (&ldquo;tweaked&rdquo;) life.</li>
<li>And by autonomous bots and hybrid cyborg creatures that protect the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; creatures.</li>
<li>Their human allies are called Ecologists: semi-mystical belief in the world remaking itself.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Imprinting&rdquo; temporarily overlays stored personalities over subjects&rsquo; own.</li>
<li>Used to put recordings of old Marines in new bodies temporarily for military service.</li>
<li>Can have traumatic psychological effects over time.</li>
<li>Use is very limited: only a few machines exist, and the equipment to make new recordings has been lost.</li>
</ul>
