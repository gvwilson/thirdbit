<!-- content --><h1>&ldquo;Iffy&rdquo;</h1>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="../">Iffy</a></em> is a YA novel about a teenage girl living in Antarctica 200 years from now.</li>
<li>Orphaned as a child, she has grown up with foster parents on a fishing boat that is just barely scraping by.</li>
<li>As her world edges closer to war,
    a chance encounter throws her into a conspiracy that reveals secrets about her past and identity.</li>
<li>Themes:<ul>
<li>We can&rsquo;t change the past: all we can do is fight for a better future.</li>
<li>We don&rsquo;t have to be who other people think we&rsquo;re supposed to be.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Aim for 90,000 words (15 chapters of 6000 words each)</li>
<li>Should there be a backgrounder/interlude at the end of every chapter
    so that the few I really want don&rsquo;t seem weird?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>The story opens 200 years in the future and roughly 150 years after the Melt.<ul>
<li>Climate change has made large parts of the world uninhabitable.</li>
<li>Overfishing and desperate experiments gone wrong wreaked havoc on ocean life.</li>
<li>AI became autonomous and closed the skies (no air travel or access to space).</li>
<li>Cloning has become commonplace (partly to pass on expensive genetic tweaks).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Antarctica is home to half a million people, most in a handful of settlements where the ice has melted.<ul>
<li>Halley: a small fishing port (about 20,000 people).</li>
<li>Rothera: Antarctica&rsquo;s largest city (about 100,000 people) and home to one of the world&rsquo;s last active coal mines.</li>
<li>Paddington South: mentioned but not visited.</li>
<li>Bharati: ravaged by fire twenty years ago and (supposedly) abandoned.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Governed by clones of Governor Stern named after their locations (e.g., Governor Stern Rothera).<ul>
<li>Halley, Rothera, and Paddington South all have a governor; Bharati&rsquo;s (supposedly) died in the fire.</li>
<li>Governors nominally answer to the United Nations Emergency Authority (UNEA) but are effectively independent.</li>
<li>Unknown to most people, the clones have been jockeying for supremacy for decades.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Major foreign powers are the Common Republic of Australia (Aussies) and Grande Brazil (Zillions).<ul>
<li>Zillions are green zealots, but are being courted by Rothera&rsquo;s governor.<ul>
<li>Offering to shut down the coal mine in exchange for Zillion backing independence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Halley&rsquo;s governor is growing closer to the Aussies in response.</li>
<li>Paddington South&rsquo;s governor is trying to be the balance of power.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Human struggles are overshadowed by fears of AI.<ul>
<li>The war during the Melt was short and one-sided.</li>
<li>Major AIs are referred to as Nova Zembla and Singapore,
    but people don&rsquo;t really know what their relationship is or if they&rsquo;re separate (or even if they&rsquo;re truly conscious).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anything large or fast that tries to fly doesn&rsquo;t last long.<ul>
<li>Limited access to old satellite networks (GPS and telecoms).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Humans make limited use of Hell (the internet) because of fears of what lurks there.<ul>
<li>And are very strongly opposed to surveillance.</li>
<li><em>This plot device keeps future human use of technology familiar to present-day readers.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The interior of Antarctica (called the &ldquo;backayonder&rdquo;) still has ice, but also now has large stretches of tundra.<ul>
<li>Populated by genetically engineered (&ldquo;tweaked&rdquo;) life.</li>
<li>And by autonomous bots and cyborgs that protect the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; creatures.</li>
<li>Their human allies are called Ecologists: semi-mystical belief in the world remaking itself.</li>
<li>Most people think the Ecologists are allied with the Zillions,
    but in reality they have very different visions:
    the Zillions want to put things back the way they were,
    the Ecologists accept that the world has to move on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;Imprinting&rdquo; temporarily overlays a stored personality over the subject&rsquo;s
    (or victim&rsquo;s, depending on your point of view).<ul>
<li>Used to put recordings of old Marines in new bodies temporarily for military service.</li>
<li>Can have traumatic psychological effects over time.</li>
<li>Use is very limited: only a few machines exist, and the equipment to make new recordings has been lost.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ocean travel near Antarctica is dangerous because of &ldquo;boils&rdquo;.<ul>
<li>Frozen methane clathrates on the sea floor melt and burst, releasing gas.</li>
<li>Creates rich fishing but ships can sink when the water turns to foam.</li>
<li>Note that &ldquo;fishing&rdquo; mostly means jellyfish: actual fish have become rare and sea-going mammals are all extinct.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>When they send it up for a test flight the Marines destroy it.</li>
