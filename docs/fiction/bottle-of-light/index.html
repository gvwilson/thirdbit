<section>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, a boy named Zumu lived with his mother and father in a
darkness that never ended. Fires crackled and burned but cast no light.
Days were warm and nights were cool, but the sun never shone, and the
stars never twinkled. People cooked their meals and mended their clothes
by touch, because the dribs and drabs of light they had were too
precious to waste.</p>
<p>Every day, Zumu&rsquo;s mother and father took a few drops of light and went
into the forest to gather as many plump, rubbery mushrooms as they
could. &ldquo;It rained last week,&rdquo; one or the other would say. &ldquo;I bet
there&rsquo;ll be some ripe ones under the old log by the stream.&rdquo; They put
their hands on the path-string tied to their front door. They followed
it until it met another string, then followed that one to a third. Each
time two strings joined, they felt around for the knots and beads tied
to the strings that told them which way to go. They didn&rsquo;t use their
light until they were deep in the forest, and sometimes not even then.</p>
<p>Zumu&rsquo;s earliest memories were of his father teaching him to stay on the
path and hold onto the string. &ldquo;If you ever let go, and you don&rsquo;t have
any light with you, what should you do?&rdquo; his father asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay where I am and yell for help,&rdquo; Zumu said. He hesitated.
&ldquo;But&mdash;what if I&rsquo;m so far from the village that no one can hear
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; his father said simply. And for weeks afterward, Zumu had
nightmares about wandering around lost until he starved or fell off a
cliff.</p>
<p>Not everyone in Zumu&rsquo;s village picked mushrooms. Some dug up rubies and
polished them until they were as smooth as icicles. Others trapped crows
in nets made of twigs and spider webs. Everyone worked as hard as they
could, every day, just so that they could get some light from Mister
Fing.</p>
<p>Mister Fing came to the village every week in a creaky old wagon pulled
by four evil-tempered snarly-dogs with crooked fangs and foul breath.
Tattered umbrellas stuck up from the sideboards on either side of the
plank bench at the front of the wagon. In its back were six rusty steel
drums full of light.</p>
<p>Mister Fing always parked his wagon in the middle of the village square.
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said each week as he kicked wooden blocks against its
wheels to stop it from rolling away, &ldquo;What do you have for me this
time?&rdquo; The schoolteacher, Mister Kalimu, lined the villagers up. One by
one they gave Mister Fing their mushrooms, their rubies, and their
struggling black birds. He tossed their gifts into an old canvas sack:
<em>thud</em>, <em>clunk</em>, <em>squawk</em>. Then he pumped light from the rusty steel
drums into their cans, jars, and bottles.</p>
<p>One by one the villagers bowed their heads and said, &ldquo;Thank you, Mister
Fing.&rdquo; One by one, they poured a few drops of light into the
schoolteacher&rsquo;s pail, and a thimbleful more into the barrel that was
kept in the village square for emergencies, then walked home with heavy
hearts.</p>
<p>People struggled to make their light last from one visit to the next.
They poured out a drop or two so they could cook, or fix a broken
path-string, or put new strings on a fiddle. If a boy really liked a
girl, he might splash a little bit of light on a flower every day to
make it bloom, then put a few small drops on its petals and give it to
her as a present.</p>
<p>But that only happened sometimes, because if people ran out of light
before the week was over, and their neighbors had none to lend, they had
to sit in the dark until Mister Fing&rsquo;s next visit.</p>
<p>This was Zumu&rsquo;s world. He didn&rsquo;t think it was strange, because he had
never known anything different. But from the time he was old enough to
talk, he begged Granna Ipwepu to tell him how things had been when she
was a little girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again?&rdquo; Granna Ipwepu sighed. &ldquo;Well, all right, but then straight to
bed.&rdquo; And she would begin the tale once again&hellip;</p>
<p>Years ago, Zumu&rsquo;s people had lived in a beautiful town. Light fell out
of the sky like rain, and there was color everywhere. But one night, a
wicked dragon attacked. She drove the villagers into the forest, then
somehow stole the light away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the last real night there ever was,&rdquo; Granna Ipwepu said,
&ldquo;Because you can&rsquo;t really have nights unless you have days to start
and end them, and from then on there were no real days any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mister Fing had come to them in the darkness, when they were lost and
frightened and wondering how they were going to survive. He gave them
light to put up the first path-strings and plant their first crops of
peppers and peas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the whole world like this now?&rdquo; the villagers asked him. &ldquo;Has all
the light gone from everywhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he replied, scowling. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t <em>been</em> everywhere.
But whatever you do, don&rsquo;t wander too far from the village. There are
monsters out there with sharp fangs and quick claws. You&rsquo;ll be safe if
you stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few people ignored his advice. &ldquo;The whole world can&rsquo;t be like
this,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;There must still be light ought there somewhere.&rdquo;
But those who set off to look for it never returned, so everyone else
learned to say, &ldquo;Thank you, Mister Fing,&rdquo; at the end of every week.</p>
<p>Maybe it was listening to Granna Ipwepu&rsquo;s story over and over again, or
maybe Zumu had just been born with an imagination three sizes too big.
Whatever the reason, Zumu grew up telling tall tales to anyone who would
listen. &ldquo;I heard the dragon!&rdquo; he told his mother when he was four
years old. &ldquo;In the trees by Granna&rsquo;s house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Zumu,&rdquo; his mother said. &ldquo;That was just thunder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, Papa, I found some light! I found some light!&rdquo; he said when he
was seven, banging the door behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?! Where?&rdquo; his father asked. His chair creaked as he stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the forest, near Granna&rsquo;s house. It was blue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, show me,&rdquo; his father said. He took Zumu&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Zumu held back. &ldquo;Well, come on,&rdquo; his father said. &ldquo;Every bit helps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know if I can find it again,&rdquo; Zumu mumbled. &ldquo;It was
only there for a second or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zumu&hellip;&rdquo; his father growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shush, dear,&rdquo; Zumu&rsquo;s mother said. She put her hands on her son&rsquo;s
head, then on his shoulders, then knelt down in front of him. &ldquo;Zumu,
did you <em>really</em> see some light in the forest by Granna&rsquo;s?&rdquo; she asked
gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I did,&rdquo; he said, ashamed. &ldquo;Just a little bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hugged him. &ldquo;Well, if it was just a little bit, it&rsquo;s probably gone
by now anyway, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;So why don&rsquo;t we just have our
peas and peppers, and then go to bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then there was his tenth birthday. &ldquo;Zumu, could you please stand
up?&rdquo; Mister Kalimu said. The village children were sitting in a
semi-circle around the teacher so that they could share his meager
light.</p>
<p>Zumu stood up straight. &ldquo;Yes, sir?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What day is it today, everyone?&rdquo; the teacher asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zumu&rsquo;s birthday!&rdquo; the children said together.</p>
<p>The teacher nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, it&rsquo;s Zumu&rsquo;s birthday. And what
happens on birthdays?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light! Light! Enough to walk home!&rdquo; the children said, clapping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, whoever is having the birthday gets enough light to
walk all the way home. Would you like your light today, Zumu?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes please!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; the teacher asked, stroking his chin. &ldquo;Do you think you
need it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children fell silent. This wasn&rsquo;t how birthdays were supposed to
go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo; Zumu asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you really need that much light?&rdquo; the teacher repeated.
&ldquo;I mean, anyone who can escape from a snarly-dog in the middle of the
forest without any light at all hardly needs any from us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu felt his face burning. He knew what the teacher was talking about.
&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; he mumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, tell us, were you really chased by a snarly-dog?&rdquo; the teacher
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; he repeated, hanging his head. Someone snickered. Behind
him, Wumingu whispered, &ldquo;Liar, liar, sat on fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; the teacher said severely. &ldquo;In fact, I
<em>know</em> you didn&rsquo;t, because Mister Fing would never let his snarly-dogs
chase anyone. Mister Fing takes very good care of us. He brings us our
light, and without that&hellip; Well, can you imagine how horrible life
would be? <em>I</em> certainly can.&rdquo; The dread in his voice made the children
shiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, sir,&rdquo; Zumu mumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right. You may sit down.</p>
<p>Now, who has ten perfect M&rsquo;s for me?&rdquo; he asked. The children passed
him their homework, so that he could check how neatly they had poked
little dimples into the maple leaves they used to practice writing.
After class, Zumu walked home in the dark as if it were just another
day.</p>
<p>The seasons turned. Zumu turned eleven, then twelve. On a warm day when
the forest smelled like spring his mother and father sat him down.
&ldquo;Zumu,&rdquo; his mother said, smiling, &ldquo;Your father and I have something
to tell you. We&rsquo;re going to have another baby!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu didn&rsquo;t say anything. &ldquo;Zumu?&rdquo; his mother said. &ldquo;Is everything
all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I&mdash;do I get to choose?&rdquo; he asked slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Choose what?&rdquo; his mother asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I get to choose whether it&rsquo;s a brother or a sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mother and father laughed. &ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t get to choose,&rdquo; his
mother said, hugging him. &ldquo;Neither do we. But you can help us pick out
names if you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As spring turned into summer, then fall, Zumu&rsquo;s mother grew big and
round. One day Zumu&rsquo;s father said, &ldquo;Zumu, your mother&rsquo;s time is
close. I have to stay with her in case the baby comes, so you must take
our mushrooms to the market tomorrow for Mister Fing. Do you think you
can do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you promise to be careful?&rdquo; his mother asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; Zumu told her. He was twelve years old, and this was the
most important thing he had ever been asked to do.</p>
<p>He lay in bed that night, listening to the wind run its fingers through
the branches of the trees and thinking about tomorrow. Some children
said that Mister Fing&rsquo;s snarly-dogs chased the ghosts of lost children
through the forest at night. Others said that he had taken his heart out
and hidden it in a tree so that he would never grow old. Outside, the
wind moaned softly. Zumu shivered and pulled his blanket tighter around
himself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Zumu&hellip; Zumu, it&rsquo;s time to get up.&rdquo; Somehow it was morning, and
Zumu&rsquo;s mother was gently shaking his shoulder. He got up, pulled his
hair back into a ponytail, and put on his pants, shirt, and sandals.</p>
<p>Breakfast was peas and mashed peppers, just like always, but as his
hands carefully explored the table, Zumu found a small glass of milk as
well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you be drinking this to help the baby grow?&rdquo; Zumu asked
his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had some yesterday,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;This glass is for you, because
it&rsquo;s such a special day.&rdquo; Zumu drank it slowly, then held the glass
upside down and licked drops off the rim to make sure he got it all.</p>
<p>The door opened, and Zumu&rsquo;s father came in. He had been sprinkling
light onto the vegetables in the garden. A dim aura remained to light
the first steps of Zumu&rsquo;s journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ready to go?&rdquo; he asked his son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; Zumu said.</p>
<p>Zumu&rsquo;s father gave him an empty bottle as big as his head, a bag full
of mushrooms, and a warm hug. His mother hugged him too. &ldquo;Now remember,
be careful, and keep your hand on the string,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; Zumu said, hugging her back. He slung the bag of
mushrooms over his shoulder and set off for the village, bottle in one
hand, path-string in the other.</p>
<p>He walked quickly at first, savoring the last fading glow from the
garden. Once that was gone, he slowed down so that he would not trip
over roots or fallen branches. The mushrooms wouldn&rsquo;t mind if they were
dropped, but he didn&rsquo;t want to show up in the village with skinned
knees. And he certainly didn&rsquo;t want to let the bottle fall&mdash;as thick
as it was, it would surely shatter if it landed on a stone.</p>
<p>Zumu counted the knots in the path-string as he walked. A hundred
fifty-one&hellip; A hundred fifty-two&hellip; Then a big knot that meant there
was a hill ahead, and after that, more little knots to count.</p>
<p>The path-string led to a thick old pine tree. Zumu ran his hand over its
gnarled bark, looking for other strings. Two square beads, and one
round: nope, not that one. He groped a little further. Three round, one
triangle: that was it. Off he went again.</p>
<p>Zumu reached the village square a few minutes later. People were already
standing around a small bowl of light, swapping goods and gossip.
&ldquo;Tomatoes?&rdquo; one woman said. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s been <em>ages</em> since I had a
tomato&mdash;they take <em>so</em> much light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; said the man beside her. &ldquo;But they taste so good.
I&rsquo;d be happy to let you have one if you had some cheese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the woman said, disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have some cheese,&rdquo; someone else said to her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be happy to
swap it for a spool of thread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A whole spool?&rdquo; the woman scoffed good-naturedly. &ldquo;Why, I <em>might</em>
have an arm&rsquo;s length I could do without&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu joined the crowd but didn&rsquo;t say anything. Some of the grown-ups
looked at him curiously, but when they saw his bottle, they nodded and
went back to their conversations.</p>
<p>A few people asked him how his mother was doing. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s fine, thank
you,&rdquo; Zumu replied politely. It was a small village; everyone knew that
his mother&rsquo;s time was close.</p>
<p><em>Bong, bong&hellip; Bong, bong&hellip;</em> Zumu nearly jumped out of his skin, even
though he&rsquo;d heard the big bell ring every week since he&rsquo;d been born.
It hung from a tree overlooking the road that led to the village.
Teenagers waited there for Mister Fing&rsquo;s wagon. The first one to spot
the drips of light that always seemed to leak out of the drums it
carried rang the bell to let the village know.</p>
<p>Mister Kalimu raised his arms. &ldquo;All right, everyone, line up,&rdquo; he said
in the same important voice he used when talking to children at school.
He was a tall man, with broad shoulders and a square beard. His father
had been the schoolteacher before him, and it just seemed natural that
he was the one to line everyone up or calculate how much light everyone
owed the school and the village&rsquo;s emergency supply.</p>
<p>The villagers quickly formed a neat line. A few people kept talking
quietly, but most fell silent. Zumu carefully set his bottle on the
ground. Mister Fing wasn&rsquo;t even in the village yet, but Zumu&rsquo;s heart
was already racing.</p>
<p>Then he heard them, panting and growling in the distance. The
snarly-dogs! Someone gasped. Goosebumps broke out on Zumu&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>Mister Fing&rsquo;s wagon rolled into town a few moments later, rattling and
squeaking behind the four dogs harnessed to it. Each time it hit a bump,
flashes of light spilled from the steel drums it carried. A few drops
stuck to the umbrellas over Mister Fing&rsquo;s head, fading slowly. The
sight was as breathtaking as the year-end fireworks but frightening
instead of beautiful.</p>
<p>The snarly-dogs brought the wagon around in a big circle, so that when
it stopped, it was pointed back the way it had come, then threw
themselves panting onto the hard-packed earth. Mister Fing stepped down
from his seat. &ldquo;Oomph,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;All right, let&rsquo;s see what
you&rsquo;ve got for me this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mister Fing was as wide as Zumu was tall, and as bald as an egg. He wore
a long-sleeved black shirt under baggy blue overalls, black lace-up
boots that reached halfway to his knees, and a black bowler hat pushed
down almost to his eyes. In his hands he held a thick black walking
stick with a handle carved in the shape of a crow&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>The schoolteacher stood at the head of the line and waved people forward
one by one. Mister Fing took what each person offered, squinted at it,
and threw it into his sack with a <em>thud</em>, a <em>clunk</em>, or a <em>clang</em>. Light
glowed for a few seconds as he filled their jug or bottle. Each time the
glow came, parents looked at their children, and teenagers who thought
they were in love looked at each other. No one tried to bargain with
him. They just said, &ldquo;Thank you, Mister Fing,&rdquo; one after another, as
they always did.</p>
<p>Each time the line moved forward, Zumu picked up his bottle, took two
steps, then set it down again on the hard ground. He was doing this for
the dozenth time when somebody shoved into line in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; said Zumu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey what?&rdquo; sneered the boy who had just arrived. It was Wumingu. He
was the same age as Zumu, but almost a head taller. He and Zumu had
played together when they were little, and Zumu still had a wooden
whistle that Wumingu had given him for his sixth birthday.</p>
<p>But ever since Wumingu&rsquo;s father had disappeared in the forest, Wumingu
had turned mean. He had been drinking one night and started complaining.
It wasn&rsquo;t fair that people had to work so hard for so little light, was
it? &ldquo;We should just take it,&rdquo; he blustered. &ldquo;Th&rsquo; next time he&rsquo;s
here, we should jus&rsquo; take it. &lsquo;S only one of him, an&rsquo;&hellip; an&rsquo;&hellip;
<em>dozens</em> of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>People tried to calm him down, but that only made him angrier. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
jus&rsquo;&hellip; jus&rsquo;&hellip; You&rsquo;re <em>chickens</em>, that&rsquo;s what you are! There
<em>has</em> t&rsquo; be more light out there somewhere, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m gonna find it!&rdquo;
With that, he stumbled into the forest.</p>
<p>No one realized he was lost until the next day, when Wumingu&rsquo;s mother,
frantic with fear, began knocking on doors to ask if anyone had seen or
heard him. Everyone turned out for the search. They walked along the
path-strings, calling his name, or stood still and listened as hard as
they could, hoping to hear him breathe. But he was never found.</p>
<p>His father&rsquo;s disappearance wasn&rsquo;t what made Wumingu mean, though. What
made that happen was the stories the children told. The quickest way to
earn a black eye in the schoolyard was to say out loud that Wumingu&rsquo;s
father had been eaten by Mister Fing&rsquo;s snarly-dogs, or by Mister Fing
himself. And if you said that he had been right, that there were still
places where the light hadn&rsquo;t gone away, and that he had found one of
them and decided to stay there instead of coming back to his family,
you&rsquo;d be black and blue by the time Wumingu was finished&hellip;</p>
<p>Zumu knew all about those stories, because he had started some of them
himself. &ldquo;What if it was the dragon?&rdquo; he had whispered to a hushed
group of children one day. &ldquo;What if she was out there, just waiting for
someone to go too far from the village, and <em>gulp</em>!&rdquo; That one had
earned him a bloody nose, and three days of mending path-strings and
clearing branches from paths when the teacher found out why. Wumingu
hadn&rsquo;t been his friend since.</p>
<p>All of this flashed through Zumu&rsquo;s mind in an instant, but all he said
to Wumingu was, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not allowed to shove in like that. Go take
your place in line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know?&rdquo; Wumingu sneered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just a fungus boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo; Zumu asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fungus boy,&rdquo; Wumingu repeated. &ldquo;All you have is mushrooms.
Everybody knows Mister Fing wants crows more than anything. He always
gives the best light to people who bring him crows.&rdquo; He held up a pair
of struggling birds, their wings tied tight around their bodies, their
feet caught in loops of rough twine.</p>
<p>Just as Wumingu said &lsquo;crows&rsquo;, Zumu&rsquo;s eyes got big and round.
&ldquo;Wumingu&mdash;&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s <em>Mister</em> Wumingu to you, fungus boy,&rdquo; Wumingu replied,
crossing his arms and scowling.</p>
<p>Behind Wumingu a deep voice said, &ldquo;<em>Mister</em> Wumingu, is it? My, my&hellip;
I knew Kalimu called himself &lsquo;mister&rsquo;, but I didn&rsquo;t know there were
any others around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wumingu&rsquo;s mouth fell open, then closed with a gulp. Slowly, very
slowly, he uncrossed his arms and turned around.</p>
<p>Mister Fing was standing right there!</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p>Mister Fing tapped the head of his cane slowly in the palm of his hand
as he glared at Wumingu. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Mister Fing,&rdquo; Wumingu mumbled. &ldquo;I was only&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were <em>only</em>,&rdquo; Mister Finger sneered. The head of the cane went
<em>smack, smack, smack</em> against his hand. &ldquo;Mister indeed! Do you know
what I have to do to bring a little light to this measly dirt-scratch
village every week? Do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mister Kalimu stepped forward quickly. &ldquo;Oh, he knows, Mister Fing. We
all know, and we&rsquo;re all very grateful that you&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>One of the snarly-dogs growled deep in its throat. The schoolteacher
stepped back, his false smile drooping like a wet sock. Everyone else
looked at the ground, embarrassed, afraid, or both.</p>
<p>Mister Fing poked Wumingu in the chest with a stubby finger. &ldquo;There are
fangsters out there, boy,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;Fangsters and banshees and a
<em>dragon</em>.&rdquo; He paused for effect. &ldquo;You <em>do</em> all remember the dragon,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mister Fing,&rdquo; everyone mumbled.</p>
<p>Mister Fing snapped his fingers. &ldquo;Here. Show me these crows you&rsquo;re so
proud of.&rdquo; Wumingu handed him the two birds he had caught. Mister Fing
held them up in front of his face, sneering as they struggled to peck
his nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Mister Fing said, &ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t much to look at, are they?
Are they, <em>mister</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mister Fing,&rdquo; Wumingu mumbled again. Zumu could hear how close he
was to crying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they&rsquo;re not. Tell me: how much light do you think they&rsquo;re
worth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Mister Fing.&rdquo; Wumingu&rsquo;s voice was barely a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they&rsquo;re worth any light at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu&rsquo;s stomach went cold. Somebody in line behind him whispered, &ldquo;Oh,
no&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mister Fing tossed the crows into his sack. &ldquo;Here, give me that.&rdquo; he
said, snapping his fingers again.</p>
<p>Trembling, Wumingu handed over his empty can. Mister Fing set it on the
backboard of his wagon, unscrewed its lid with a flourish, then picked
up his hose. He pressed the button on the nozzle very gently with his
thumb. A single drop of light, no bigger than a tear, fell into the can
with a sad and hollow <em>plonk</em>.</p>
<p>Zumu&rsquo;s stomach went cold. One drop of light! That wouldn&rsquo;t last more
than a few heartbeats! It would never get Wumingu and his mother through
a whole week! And what would happen to their vegetable garden?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; Mister Fing said. He screwed the lid back onto the can and
held it out for Wumingu to take.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Th-thank you, Mister Fing.&rdquo; Wumingu was so quiet that Zumu could
barely hear him. He turned around and pushed past Zumu, hugging the
metal can to his chest. No one said a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry about that, Mister Fing,&rdquo; the schoolteacher said.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re <em>all</em> sorry, I&rsquo;m sure, and I promise that&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>Mister Fing cut him off with a glance, then turned his cold eyes on the
crowd. &ldquo;All right, who&rsquo;s next? I haven&rsquo;t got all day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu stepped forward and handed over his bag full of mushrooms. Mister
Fing dumped them into his sack without even counting them, then filled
Zumu&rsquo;s bottle with light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mister Fing,&rdquo; Zumu said dutifully, but Mister Fing had
already turned to the person behind him.</p>
<p>The pride Zumu felt when he set out that morning had evaporated. He had
daydreamed sometimes about getting back at Wumingu for his bullying, but
not like this. Nobody deserved this. This was as bad as&mdash;as&mdash;as
breaking a path-string on purpose.</p>
<p>A path-string&hellip; Zumu stopped short, then whirled around and raced over
to one of the trees on the edge of the village. Round, triangle,
round&hellip; Two squares, round, triangle&hellip; That was it! Hand on the
path-string, he hurried into the forest.</p>
<p>He rehearsed stories under his breath as he walked. &ldquo;One of Mister
Fing&rsquo;s snarly-dogs got loose and came after me.&rdquo; No, that wouldn&rsquo;t
work&mdash;his father would be sure to ask in the village if anyone else
had been hurt. &ldquo;The path-string was broken, so I&mdash;no, no, no.&rdquo; He
shook his head. That wouldn&rsquo;t work either.</p>
<p>He was still trying to think of what to tell his parents when he heard
someone crying. &ldquo;Wumingu?&rdquo; Zumu asked. &ldquo;Is that you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu heard the faint squelchy sound of someone wiping their eyes. &ldquo;What
do <em>you</em> want?&rdquo; Wumingu snarled.</p>
<p>Zumu felt along the string until he found Wumingu&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo;
Zumu said, holding out his bottle. &ldquo;Take some of our light. I&rsquo;ll tell
my mother and father I spilled it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wumingu might have stared at Zumu, or his jaw might have dropped in
amazement. In the dark, Zumu could not tell. All he knew was that
Wumingu said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want <em>your</em> stupid light!&rdquo; and knocked the
bottle out of Zumu&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p><em>Crack!</em> The bottle hit the ground and broke into a dozen pieces. The
whole forest lit up as a week&rsquo;s worth of light spilled into the air.
Zumu and Wumingu cried out together. Some nearby bats squeaked and
twittered furiously, then fell silent as the light disappeared into the
sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wumingu&mdash;what have you done?&rdquo; Zumu whispered.</p>
<p>Wumingu was speechless for a moment, as shocked as Zumu. Then he said,
&ldquo;Serves you right, fungus boy!&rdquo; and ran away down the path.</p>
<p>Zumu stood there, his mind whirling. He could not believe what had just
happened. All of his family&rsquo;s light, gone&mdash;and with a new baby about
to arrive!</p>
<p>He was still standing there when Granna Ipwepu came hobbling along the
path carrying her week&rsquo;s ration of light in a battered old teakettle
with a cork in its spout.</p>
<p>She stopped a few knots away from Zumu. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; she asked
sharply. Even when there was light, the old woman had a hard time
seeing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, Granna,&rdquo; Zumu said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that your light these old eyes of mine saw?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu nodded. &ldquo;Yes, Granna.&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t until a single hot tear
trickled down his cheek that he realized he was crying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there, there, child,&rdquo; Granna Ipwepu clucked. She hobbled forward
and put her bony arm around Zumu&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;There, there, there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu shrugged her arm away and stepped back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; he
lied. He wiped his nose with his sleeve angrily as he felt fresh tears
well up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Granna Ipwepu asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guess I tripped,&rdquo; Zumu said miserably. He kicked one piece of
the broken bottle off the path, then another.</p>
<p>Granna Ipwepu clucked her tongue. &ldquo;Tsk tsk&hellip;&rdquo; she scolded, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what comes of going too fast. I&rsquo;ve always said, the faster you go, the
longer it takes you to get anywhere. And now look what&rsquo;s happened! And
with a new baby on the way too&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Granna.&rdquo; Zumu&rsquo;s voice caught in his throat.</p>
<p>Granna Ipwepu&rsquo;s tone softened. &ldquo;Oh, child, don&rsquo;t cry. It&rsquo;s not the
end of the world. We&rsquo;ve already had one of those, and we&rsquo;re still
here, aren&rsquo;t we? Here, you just hold on a tick.&rdquo; The path-string went
<em>twong</em> as Granna Ipwepu let it go. Leaves rustled as she brushed her
hand through the branches over their heads. There was a soft <em>pock</em> as
she plucked an acorn, and an even softer <em>ploop</em> as she pulled off its
cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she muttered, patting her dress, &ldquo;I <em>know</em> I had that thimble
this morning. Ah, here it is!&rdquo; She pulled the cork out of the spout of
her kettle with her teeth and tilted it ever so gently. Three tiny drops
of light went <em>plip plip plip</em> into the thimble. She covered it with her
thumb while she put the cork back in the kettle, then screwed the acorn
cap onto the thimble as a lid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she said, feeling along the string to find Zumu&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;You
give this to your parents. I know it isn&rsquo;t much, but maybe if everyone
gives you a little&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Th-thank you, Granna,&rdquo; Zumu said. She patted his shoulder, then
hobbled away, clucking and muttering under her breath. The path-string
twitched in Zumu&rsquo;s hand, fainter and fainter, before finally falling
still.</p>
<p>Zumu stood alone in the dark. He wanted to cry. He wanted to make time
go backward or wake up and find that this whole day had been a dream,
that he was still lying in bed, and still had a chance to get everything
right. Most of all, he wanted a full bottle of light to take home to his
mother and father, not just three drops in a thimble. But the only place
to get light was from Mister Fing&rsquo;s wagon, and it was probably leaving
the village at that very moment.</p>
<p>Mister Fing&rsquo;s wagon&hellip; Wait! The drums in Mister Finger&rsquo;s wagon might
not be empty! Maybe Zumu could borrow some light until next week. He
would pick extra mushrooms for a whole year&mdash;for the rest of his
life, if he had to! Just so long as there was light when the new baby
arrived.</p>
<p>Zumu raced back to the village. The path-string flew through his fingers
so fast that it burned. Even so, he was too late. The village square was
silent, empty, and dark. Mister Fing was gone.</p>
<p>Faintly, far away, Zumu heard the <em>creak, creak</em> of the wagon&rsquo;s wheels
as the snarly-dogs pulled it down the steep mountain road. &ldquo;Nooo....&rdquo;
he moaned. He had only missed it by a minute. It wasn&rsquo;t fair&mdash;it
just wasn&rsquo;t fair!</p>
<p>Zumu felt like he might start crying again. Instead, he took a deep
breath and made the biggest decision of his life. He let go of the
path-string and plunged into the forest.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<p>Branches slapped Zumu in the face, and roots grabbed at his feet. One
false step, one nasty hole, could break his leg. A stone rolling out
from under his feet could spill him over the edge of a cliff.</p>
<p>Zumu knew what he was doing was dangerous. If he got lost in the
darkness, he might never find his way home. But he and his friends had
pooled their light allowances one day and followed the road out of the
village on a dare. It snaked back and forth as it went down the
mountain. If he kept his wits about him, he might be able to catch the
wagon at one of the bends. And besides, he still had Granna Ipwepu&rsquo;s
thimble in case anything went wrong.</p>
<p><em>Phwack!</em> Zumu ran straight into a big pine tree! It knocked the wind
right out of him, leaving sticky sap on his forehead and the palms of
his hands. He stood there for a moment with his head spinning. Little
sparkles danced in the darkness before his eyes.</p>
<p>As he shook his head to clear it, he saw light flash again. He blinked,
thinking it was just another sparkle from hitting his head. Then looked
off to one side. His father had taught him that it was easier to see
faint things if you didn&rsquo;t look straight at them.</p>
<p>His heart pounded as he waited. There! The light flashed again. It had
to be from the drums in the back of Mister Fing&rsquo;s wagon. He could still
catch up! He felt his way around the tree and kept going.</p>
<p>The ground leveled off under his feet a few moments later. Zumu stumbled
and fell to his knees, panting. The road smelled dry and dusty, instead
of damp and crumbly like the forest. He patted the ground in front of
him until he found the ruts made by the wagon&rsquo;s wheels, then crept
backward into the bushes.</p>
<p>Light flickered off to his right. Zumu heard the wagon&rsquo;s wheels go
<em>squeak squeak</em>, and the snarly-dogs huff and growl as they pulled it
along. Zumu shrank deeper into the bushes. He wiped his hands on his
shirt. He would only have one chance&hellip;</p>
<p>The wagon rolled around the corner. Mister Fing sat squarely in the
middle of the plank bench at the front of the wagon, his bowler hat
firmly in place. He had the snarly-dogs&rsquo; reins in one hand, and a whip
in the other. The tattered umbrellas were open over his head. The only
light was the drops that splashed into the air every time the wagon
bumped over a rock or a pothole.</p>
<p>The wagon came closer. The snarly-dogs seemed to grow bigger by the
second. Mister Fing cracked his whip again, so loudly that it made Zumu
jump in his hiding place.</p>
<p>The wagon rolled past&mdash;it was now or never! Zumu scrambled onto the
road, grabbed hold of the wagon&rsquo;s tailgate with both hands, pulled
himself up, and slipped into the back. He had done it! He was in Mister
Fing&rsquo;s wagon.</p>
<p>But now what?</p>
<p>Zumu suddenly realized that he had no idea what to do next. What if
Mister Fing <em>wouldn&rsquo;t</em> give him any light? How would he find his way
home? What if&mdash;what if he fed Zumu to the snarly-dogs?</p>
<p>Dark misgivings chased each other around inside Zumu&rsquo;s head as the
wagon bumped down the mountain road. He was still trying to think of
something when Mister Fing shouted, &ldquo;Whoa! Whoa, you stupid
creatures!&rdquo; The wagon slowed, then stopped. The snarly-dogs fell to the
ground, wheezing and drooling.</p>
<p>Zumu slithered forward past the steel drums and peeked through the
wagon&rsquo;s sideboards. Propped his walking stick against the seat, Mister
Fing poured some light from a jar into a chipped teacup. He set the
teacup down beside the cane and started pulling the things the villagers
had given him out of his sack. The crows went on the seat beside him,
still struggling to free their wings. The rubies went into his pockets.
And the mushrooms&mdash;every single mushroom was tossed into the ditch!
Zumu could hardly believe it. His father had spent days groping around
the rotten logs for those mushrooms!</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he finally muttered, turning his sack upside down and shaking
it. &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The carved crow&rsquo;s head on his walking stick opened its beak and cawed,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never understand why you let them give you the rest of that
junk. It&rsquo;s no use to you&mdash;why give them any light for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu gasped&mdash;the crow&rsquo;s head could talk! Then he clapped his hand
over his mouth. Had Mister Fing heard him?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because there aren&rsquo;t enough crows and rubies to keep them all busy,&rdquo;
Mister Fing grumbled. &ldquo;And if I don&rsquo;t keep them busy, they&rsquo;ll start
thinking about things. No good can come of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re certainly an expert on the perils of too much
thinking,&rdquo; the crow&rsquo;s head muttered.</p>
<p>Mister Fing picked up his cane and spoke directly to the carved crow&rsquo;s
head. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not going to be any trouble this
trip, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble?&rdquo; the crow&rsquo;s head squawked. &ldquo;Why would there be trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmph,&rdquo; Mister Fing snorted. &ldquo;One of these days I&rsquo;m going to figure
out how to open up their heads <em>without</em> your help. And when I do, I&rsquo;ll
toss you in the ditch with the rest of the garbage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And one of these days, I&rsquo;m going to fly again,&rdquo; the crow&rsquo;s head
squawked back. &ldquo;Care to wager which will come first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mister Fing snorted again. He set the cane down, stood up, and pulled
the cloth covers off the umbrellas at either end of his bench.</p>
<p>Zumu&rsquo;s eyes couldn&rsquo;t have gone any wider. The umbrellas&rsquo; spokes were
not made out of willow twigs like the ones the villagers made. Instead,
each spoke was a sharpened sword blade. Even in the faint light from
Mister Fing&rsquo;s teacup, their edges gleamed razor-sharp.</p>
<p>Mister Fing put his hand on one and gave it a spin. The blades went
<em>whup</em>, <em>whup</em>, <em>whup</em> over his head. He nodded and jumped down from the
wagon once again. Zumu heard him crawl underneath it. Something clanked
and scraped metallically.</p>
<p>A few moments later, Mister Fing climbed back into his seat. &ldquo;That
ought to get us home,&rdquo; he muttered, wiping his hands clean on the front
of his overalls. He picked up the reins and snapped them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haw!&rdquo; Mister Fing shouted. &ldquo;Haw, you ugly brutes, get a move on!&rdquo;
The snarly-dogs leapt to their feet and pulled against their harnesses.
The wagon began to roll, slowly at first, then faster and faster as the
snarly-dogs hit their stride until it was practically flying down the
hill.</p>
<p>As the wagon picked up speed, the umbrellas began to spin around. The
rattling and clanking underneath the wagon grew louder. Zumu realized
that Mister Fing must have hooked a chain up to the wagon&rsquo;s axles. The
turning wheels were driving the umbrellas.</p>
<p>Faster and faster they whirled, until their blades were just a blur.
&ldquo;Haw!&rdquo; Mister Fing shouted, whipping the dogs. &ldquo;Faster! Faster!&rdquo;
Light from the drums splashed onto the umbrellas as they raced along.
The spinning blades threw it into the forest around them, leaving
glowing spatters on the trees.</p>
<p>The road leveled off just as the forest ended. Zumu got to his knees and
peered over the wagon&rsquo;s sideboards. They were in the bottom of a narrow
valley. The road wasn&rsquo;t hard-packed dirt any longer. Instead, it was
covered in something hard and smooth, with a dashed yellow line running
down its middle.</p>
<p>The wagon&rsquo;s wheels made a drumming sound as they rolled over a stone
bridge. Zumu caught a single glimpse of a stream beneath it, but just at
that moment, a thousand wings flapped in the air over his head.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<p>Zumu looked up. Hundreds of black crows had appeared out of nowhere.
They circled above the wagon like dark leaves caught in a tornado, then
swooped down to attack, cawing furiously.</p>
<p>The whirling umbrella sword blades held most of them off. The few that
managed to get past threw themselves on Mister Fing. They pecked at his
hat with their sharp little beaks and scratched his face with their
sharp little claws.</p>
<p>Mister Fing took the reins in his teeth, pushed his walking stick under
his leg, and swatted at the birds.</p>
<p>Finally he couldn&rsquo;t take it any more. Spitting out the reins, he
grabbed the walking stick and held it up so that its carved handle was
just inches below the whirling blades. &ldquo;Call them off!&rdquo; he shouted.
&ldquo;Call them off, or I&rsquo;ll slice you to flinders!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The carved crow&rsquo;s head squawked at the flock. They instantly flung
themselves back into the sky, cawing with disappointment. Their flapping
wings sounded like an enormous blanket being shaken out as they
disappeared into the darkness.</p>
<p>Just as they did so, the wagon plunged into the forest on the other side
of the little valley. Mister Fing picked up the reins again. &ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo;
he shouted. The wagon slowed and stopped. The snarly-dogs fell to the
ground, gasping for air.</p>
<p>Light from the steel drums had splashed onto the wagon&rsquo;s sides during
its pell-mell ride, so much that Zumu could see the needles on the
branches over his head. Mister Fing pulled a dirty cloth out of his
pocket and wiped his forehead. Without warning, he whacked the head of
the cane against his seat. &ldquo;That&hellip; was&hellip; stupid,&rdquo; he said angrily,
rapping the head of the cane again in time with each word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ow!&rdquo; the crow&rsquo;s head cawed. &ldquo;Stop! I command you, stop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&hellip; take&hellip; orders&hellip; from&hellip; you&hellip; any&hellip; more,
remember?&rdquo; Mister Fing said grimly. <em>Crack, crack, crack</em> went the
crow&rsquo;s head, over and over again. &ldquo;And if you <em>ever</em> try a stunt like
that again, I promise, I&rsquo;ll dunk you in a bucket full of the brightest
light I have and let you sizzle. All right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll get me you one day,&rdquo; the crow&rsquo;s head squawked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Mister Fing said. He rapped the crow&rsquo;s head against the
bench one more time for good measure. &ldquo;But not today.&rdquo; He put the
cloth back in his pocket, then snapped the reins. &ldquo;Haw!&rdquo; he shouted.
The wagon rolled forward once again.</p>
<p>The road snaked back and forth, rising steadily. The air grew colder,
and the trees became smaller. Zumu hugged himself and shivered in the
back of the wagon. <em>I should have brought a sweater</em>, he thought, but
that just made him think of all the other things he should and
shouldn&rsquo;t have done that day, and <em>that</em> just made him miserable.</p>
<p>He wondered what his mother and father were doing. They would know he
was missing&mdash;he should have been home hours ago. They were probably
out looking for him, along with the rest of the village. He wondered
whether Wumingu would tell anyone what had happened, or if anyone would
think to ask Granna Ipwepu if she had seen him. Zumu felt as sorry for
himself as he had walking home in the dark on his tenth birthday.</p>
<p>Just then something happened that Zumu would remember for the rest of
his life. A metal pole stood beside the road ahead of the wagon. It was
tall and slender like an overgrown sapling, but it had only one branch,
which stuck straight out from its side.</p>
<p>A single piece of glass hung from that branch like some strange fruit.
As the wagon came closer, the glass started to flicker: red, orange,
red, orange, yellow, orange, yellow. The yellow light steadied, then
grew brighter and brighter, until it was the brightest thing Zumu had
ever seen.</p>
<p>He stared up at the light as the wagon rolled beneath it. Dazzle-spots
danced in front of his eyes. It was so bright that it cast shadows. Why,
it was so bright that he could see what color the leaves were!</p>
<p>Another metal pole stood by the road ahead of them. As the wagon rolled
under the first one, the piece of glass on the second one flickered into
life as well. Zumu almost forgot to breathe. The light poured over him
like warm water. He could see the dirt under his fingernails, and the
flakes of rust on the steel drums around him. He felt like he could see
everything. Had Wumingu&rsquo;s father been right? Was the rest of the world
still full of light after all?</p>
<p>But then he looked back. As the wagon rolled past the second light, the
first one started to dim: yellow, orange, red&hellip;black. As quietly as it
had come on, it went out again, plunging its stretch of road back into
darkness. Zumu shivered. The warmth and wonder he felt disappeared along
with the light. The air around him suddenly seemed cold again.</p>
<p>The wagon rolled on. The strange lights came to life and died away, over
and over again. Each one made Zumu feel even further from home. <em>Would a
week without light really have been that bad?</em> He wondered. After all,
other families got through it. And the baby-to-be might have come late
anyway&hellip;</p>
<p>He was so sunk in misery that he almost didn&rsquo;t notice the first house
they passed. Its roof sagged over its porch, and weeds had grown up
between its front steps, but there were still shutters on its windows.</p>
<p>They passed another house a few minutes later, then another, and
another, until house after house stood shoulder to shoulder on either
side of the road. <em>This must be the town,</em> Zumu thought excitedly. <em>The
town in Granna Ipwepu&rsquo;s story!</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, a loud, cheerful voice said, &ldquo;Hello, Mister Fing!&rdquo; Zumu
nearly jumped out of his skin. He peeked through the wagon&rsquo;s
sideboards.</p>
<p>Two people stood waving on the sidewalk directly underneath one of the
strange lights. They were as bald as Mister Fing, and wore overalls like
his, but had big, friendly smiles. Zumu hunched down, afraid they might
see him. As the wagon passed them, though, they picked up their rakes
and turned back to the pile of leaves behind them.</p>
<p>More people waved at the wagon as it rolled through town. &ldquo;Hello,
Mister Fing!&rdquo; they all said. None of them were young, but none of them
seemed old, either. There were no short ones, tall ones, fat ones, or
skinny ones. Instead, they were all about the same size, as bald as
eggs, and wearing identical overalls. What was worse, they all smiled
and waved in exactly the same way. Zumu grew more uneasy with each
friendly &ldquo;hello.&rdquo; Something was <em>definitely</em> not right&hellip;</p>
<p>Without warning, Mister Fing jerked on the reins and shouted, &ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo;
The wagon stopped. Zumu felt a lurch as Mister Fing climbed down from
his seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened here?&rdquo; Mister Fing asked angrily. &ldquo;Who made this
mess?&rdquo; Zumu slowly raised his head so that he could see what the fuss
was about.</p>
<p>A bald woman stood beside a tidy little house. She had a paintbrush in
one hand, and a can of paint in the other. A wooden ladder lay on the
sidewalk beside her. A man&rsquo;s body was tangled up with it. He still had
his paintbrush in his hand, but his can of paint had spilled bright blue
all over the sidewalk. His eyes were open, and he was smiling, but he
was not moving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were putting a fresh coat of trim on the house,&rdquo; the woman said
cheerfully. &ldquo;He was saying how beautiful it was. Then he fell down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful, eh?&rdquo; said Mister Fing sourly. &ldquo;Which one is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Number 20717,&rdquo; the woman said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not him again. His brain seems to wear out every time I turn
around. Put him in the back of the wagon. I&rsquo;ll see what I can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman put her paintbrush and can on the sidewalk. She moved the
ladder out of the way with one hand, then grabbed the man&rsquo;s overalls
and lifted him up as if he weighed no more than a pair of socks.</p>
<p>Zumu looked around wildly. There was nowhere to hide! He was too big to
fit behind one of the steel drums, and they would make too much noise if
he tried to push two of them together. He was going to be caught!</p>
<p>Zumu heard the bald woman walk around to the back of the wagon. His
heart raced. The catch on the backboard went <em>snick!</em> He tried to
swallow, but his mouth was too dry. The backboard swung down.</p>
<p>Zumu looked straight into the bald woman&rsquo;s eyes!</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
<p>Zumu was frozen with fright, but the woman didn&rsquo;t blink. She heaved the
man&rsquo;s body into the wagon. <em>Clunk</em> went his head. He lay there like a
log, the smile still on his face.</p>
<p>The woman closed the backboard. &ldquo;All set!&rdquo; she said cheerfully.</p>
<p>Mister Fing didn&rsquo;t look back. &ldquo;Haw!&rdquo; he shouted. The snarly-dogs
barked and strained at their harnesses. The wagon rolled forward once
again.</p>
<p>Zumu sat with his knees under his chin, trying to stay as far away from
the man&rsquo;s body as he could. His head was whirling. Why were Mister Fing
and the woman treating him as if he were no more important than a
mushroom? And the woman&mdash;why hadn&rsquo;t she said anything? She <em>must</em>
have seen him.</p>
<p>Despite all the thoughts chasing each other around his brain, Zumu&rsquo;s
eyelids began to droop as the wagon bumped along. He was tired, and
hungry, and cold, and a long, long way from home. &ldquo;Serves you right,&rdquo;
he whispered to himself. That&rsquo;s what he should have said to Wumingu,
instead of trying to fix things. It wasn&rsquo;t his fault Wumingu had called
himself &ldquo;mister&rdquo;. It wasn&rsquo;t <em>his</em> fault Mister Fing had only given
Wumingu one little drop of light.</p>
<p>Zumu shook his head. Telling himself stories about what he could have
said or should have done wasn&rsquo;t going to get him out of this. Still, he
wished he could just run home and tell his mother and father what he&rsquo;d
seen and let them figure out what to do about it. He sighed. They would
be worried sick about him. He wanted nothing more than to be back home
eating his peas and peppers or lying in bed under a pile of blankets. An
enormous pile of warm, scratchy blankets&hellip;</p>
<p>The sound of loose stones crunching beneath the wagon&rsquo;s wheels woke
Zumu up. For a moment, the splashes of light from the drums around him
made him think that he was still dreaming. Then he saw that he had
stretched out his legs while he was asleep. His foot was right in the
dead man&rsquo;s ear! He jerked his knees back up against his chest, then
turned over and peeked through the wagon&rsquo;s sideboards.</p>
<p>From the way the wind was whistling, Zumu guessed they had reached the
top of the mountain. A dozen poles with glowing glass bulbs like the
ones in town lit the scene. And what a scene it was!</p>
<p>Instead of hard-packed earth, the wagon was rolling across a big circle
of gravel.</p>
<p>An enormous round building with a domed roof stood in front of them.
Something that looked like a thick metal log stuck up from it, pointing
at the sky like a raised arm. Next to the building were a dozen round
tanks, each three stories tall. A tangle of pipes connected them to each
other and to the building. A few spare lengths of pipe lay scattered on
the ground. It was the biggest area Zumu had ever been able to see at
one time in his whole life. For a moment, the sheer <em>space</em> of it made
him dizzy.</p>
<p>Then Zumu saw thin streamers of light spraying out of tiny cracks in the
pipes and tanks. Thick bunches of weeds grew wherever the light
splashed. He would have said that nothing could ever surprise him again
after everything he had already seen that day, but when he realized that
the tanks were full of light, his jaw dropped. There was more light in
them than he thought there could be in the whole world!</p>
<p>The snarly-dogs pulled the wagon toward a clear spot between the
building and the storage tanks. &ldquo;Lazy smelly stupid ugly creatures,&rdquo;
Mister Fing grumbled as he cracked his whip over their backs. Yipping
and growling, they turned the wagon to face downhill.</p>
<p>Its axles creaked as Mister Fing stepped down to the ground. Zumu held
his breath, listening as carefully as he could. The moment he heard the
<em>clink chink clank</em> of the snarly-dogs&rsquo; harnesses being undone, he
scuttled to the rear of the wagon and slipped over the backboard. The
rough wood scraped against his belly as he lowered himself to the
ground. He took one gentle step, then another, wincing as the gravel
crunched softly under his weight.</p>
<p>Three steps, four, five&hellip; He was on bare rock. As quick as a bat, he
ran a half-dozen steps to the nearest tangle of pipes, taking care not
to kick any of the spare pieces lying on the ground, and crouched down
to hide.</p>
<p>Just as he did so, Mister Fing straightened up and tossed the
snarly-dogs&rsquo; harnesses into the back of the wagon. &ldquo;There you go, you
stupid creatures.&rdquo; The snarly-dogs snapped at each other half-heartedly
before curling up with their snouts under their tails.</p>
<p>Mister Fing took some wooden blocks that were lying on the ground and
wedged them under the wagon&rsquo;s wheels. <em>That must be to stop it from
rolling back down the mountain,</em> Zumu thought. He noticed that Mister
Fing kept his walking stick tucked under his arm while he worked. He
glanced up, but there was no sign of the flock of crows that had
attacked them earlier.</p>
<p>Once the blocks were in place, Mister Fing unlatched the wagon&rsquo;s
backboard and glared at the drums of light. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll empty you in the
morning,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s gone wrong with you
<em>this</em> time&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mister Fing grabbed the leg of the man&rsquo;s overalls, dragged his body to
the edge of the wagon, and slung it over his shoulder like a sack full
of moss. Picking up Wumingu&rsquo;s crows with his other hand, he trudged
over to a door in the side of the round building and pulled it open.
Hard white light spilled out.</p>
<p>The fallen man&rsquo;s head thumped against the side of the building as
Mister Fing stepped inside. The door closed behind him with an ominous
<em>click</em>.</p>
<p>Zumu crouched behind the tangle of pipes, his heart racing. Any thoughts
he&rsquo;d had about asking Mister Fing to lend him some light were long
gone.</p>
<p>He was still cold and hungry, but he was angry now, too. There was
enough light in the tanks around him to light every home in the village
for a thousand years. Why, there was more spilling out of the pipes and
going to waste than everyone Zumu knew used in a month, but Mister Fing
only gave them each a cup or two at a time! And he had thrown away the
mushrooms his parents had worked so hard to collect as if they were
worthless!</p>
<p>For a moment, Zumu thought about hitching the snarly-dogs to one of the
tanks and dragging it all the way back the village. But no, they were
far too big. Maybe he could fill the drums in the back of the wagon and
take them home instead. He&rsquo;d give some to his mother, for the new baby,
and some to Granna Ipwepu for her flower garden, and even some to
Wumingu, just to prove that <em>he</em> wasn&rsquo;t a bully.</p>
<p>Then Zumu shook his head. The snarly-dogs&rsquo; teeth were as long as
Zumu&rsquo;s feet. He couldn&rsquo;t just hitch them to the wagon as if they were
somebody&rsquo;s pet moles. And Zumu was pretty sure Mister Fing wouldn&rsquo;t be
pleased if someone made off with his wagon. No, the most sensible thing
would be to find a bottle, fill it with light, and try to walk home
without getting caught.</p>
<p>But then Zumu thought again about the baby-to-be. He thought about the
long days his father spent on his knees in the forest gathering
mushrooms, and about Wumingu&rsquo;s missing father. And then he said to
himself, <em>Well, I&rsquo;ve come this far&hellip;</em></p>
<p>The snarly-dogs were already snoring, but Zumu waited a few more minutes
before stepping over the pipe and tiptoeing over to the building. One of
the snarly-dogs snuffled in its sleep as he went by. He froze. It licked
its chops, then started to snore again. Zumu swallowed the knot in his
throat and kept going, his eyes fixed on the light puddled under the
door Mister Fing had gone through.</p>
<p>Zumu turned the door handle slowly. The latch clicked. He glanced over
his shoulder at the snarly-dogs: yes, they were still asleep.</p>
<p>Gingerly, he opened the door and slipped inside.</p>
<p>A little glass bulb like the ones he&rsquo;d seen in town hung from the
ceiling, giving off the hard white light Zumu had seen earlier. As he
let out his breath, the door closed behind him with a soft <em>click</em>.</p>

<section>
<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<p>Zumu found himself standing in a short hallway. He tiptoed to the door
at the far end and sounded out the words on the dusty brass sign
attached to it: &ldquo;Main Telescope&rdquo;. Holding his breath, he opened the
door and stepped through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip;&rdquo; he breathed. The inside of the building was one enormous
room. Small white lights hung from the curved ceiling. A narrow metal
walkway ran around the wall, and another cut across to the other side.</p>
<p>The metal log seemed to float in the middle of the room. It took Zumu a
moment to realize that it was actually held between the arms of an
enormous metal &ldquo;U&rdquo;. One end stuck out through a rectangular slot in
the roof. The other grew skinnier as it got closer to the floor, like an
upside-down tree.</p>
<p><em>That must be the &ldquo;telescope,&rdquo;</em> Zumu thought. <em>I wonder what it&rsquo;s
for?</em></p>
<p>He peered over the walkway railing. A thick hose was bolted onto the end
of the telescope below. It led to a pump as big as Mister Fing&rsquo;s wagon
and as ugly as a snarly-dog.</p>
<p>A metal pipe came out of the pump&rsquo;s back. It snaked across the floor to
a hole in the wall.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not what Zumu saw first. What he saw first was Mister Fing
standing at a workbench next to the pump. The top of the workbench was
completely covered with nuts and bolts, saws, hammers, and pieces of
wood that had been carved to look like feet and ears. The crow-headed
cane lay carelessly on top of one of the piles of junk, the two tied-up
crows beside it still wriggling.</p>
<p>Zumu&rsquo;s eyes widened. Two&mdash;no, three&mdash;people stood motionless
beside the workbench. The first had no head! The second was missing both
arms! And the third&mdash;the third was the man from the back of the
wagon! His eyes were open, and he was smiling, but he didn&rsquo;t seem to be
moving a muscle. What was going on here?</p>
<p>Mister Fing didn&rsquo;t pay any attention to the strange figures. Instead,
he picked up a metal bottle with a pointed nozzle and a trigger handle
that stood on the workbench. When he squeezed the handle, a thin spray
of light sputtered out and fizzled into nothing.</p>
<p>Mister Fing muttered in disgust. Zumu was glad he couldn&rsquo;t hear the
words&mdash;he was pretty sure they were ones he wasn&rsquo;t supposed to know.
Still muttering, Mister Fing went to a tap sticking out of the wall. He
took the top off the bottle, held it under the tap, and turned the
handle.</p>
<p>A stream of pure white light gurgled into the bottle. When it was full,
Mister Fing turned off the tap and screwed the bottle&rsquo;s top back on.
When he squeezed the handle this time, light shot halfway across the
room. &ldquo;Hmph,&rdquo; he snorted, sounding no happier than before.</p>
<p>The two crows Wumingu had caught struggled frantically against the
string knotted around their wings as Mister Fing picked them up. Zumu
could hear the fear in their cars, and the anger in the answering caws
from the crow&rsquo;s head cane. Ignoring the noise, Mister Fing aimed the
bottle&rsquo;s nozzle at them and sprayed them with light.</p>
<p>The crows&rsquo; caws turned into one long <em>aawwwwwwwkkkkk</em>, then fell
silent. Something that looked like gray smoke rose from them. Zumu felt
sick. Did Mister Fing <em>eat</em> crows?</p>
<p>But no&mdash;the light wasn&rsquo;t burning them. When Mister Fing finally
stopped spraying them, they looked no different, although their
struggles were weaker. Setting the bottle down, Mister Fing undid the
loops of string that held them prisoner and tossed them into the air.
They fluttered around his head for a moment, ignoring the plaintive caws
from the crow&rsquo;s head cane below, then flew up the length of the
telescope and out into the dark sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; Mister Fing said, satisfied. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s two less to worry
about.&rdquo; The crow&rsquo;s head cane didn&rsquo;t answer.</p>
<p>With that job done&mdash;whatever it was&mdash;Mister Fing took the rubies
the villagers had collected out of his pockets and toss them into a
battered old metal bucket. Once his pockets were empty, he picked out
one thumb-sized ruby that glistened more brightly than the rest. He held
it up level with his eyes and measured it carefully with a metal ruler.
&ldquo;Hmph.&rdquo; He clipped the ruby into a small glass vise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, where&rsquo;s that lens?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He poked through the odds and ends piled on his workbench. After a
moment, the crow&rsquo;s head said, &ldquo;You know, you&rsquo;re getting to be as
messy as a mammal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without looking up, Mister Fing reached over, picked up the walking
stick, and rapped its handle hard against the edge of the workbench.
&ldquo;You watch your beak,&rdquo; he warned. &ldquo;Or I&rsquo;ll dunk you in the light
next time. You know how much you&rsquo;d like <em>that</em>, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He tossed
it back onto the workbench contemptuously and continued poking at the
mess in front of him.</p>
<p>A moment later he grunted, &ldquo;There you are.&rdquo; He picked up a curved
piece of glass. Holding it a few inches away from the ruby, he pointed
the bottle&rsquo;s nozzle at it and squeezed the trigger.</p>
<p>The curved lens squeezed the light that fell on it into a dazzling white
thread. It sizzled when it hit the ruby. Shadows danced around the room
as Mister Fing shaved a sliver off the bright red stone. Even after
Mister Fing stopped pumping, Zumu saw a bright after-image in front of
his eyes.</p>
<p>Mister Fing set the bottle down on the floor and took the ruby from the
vise. He juggled it from hand to hand, blowing on it, before setting it
back down on the workbench.</p>
<p>As he waited for it to cool, he took off his hat to reveal a large
bandage plastered to his forehead. Picking up a mirror, he studied the
bandage carefully, patting it with his hand to make sure it was secure.
Then he picked up his cane, holding it up so that the crow&rsquo;s head was
looking straight into the eyes of the man who had fallen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, do your little trick,&rdquo; Mister Fing growled, one hand still
on his bandage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say &lsquo;please&rsquo;,&rdquo; the crow&rsquo;s head cawed. Mister Fing rapped it on the
edge of the table and held it up again, his hand still on his bandage.</p>
<p>The crow&rsquo;s head opened its beak and cawed a shrill little tune, <em>kar
koo kaw</em>. With a quiet click, a hatch the size of Zumu&rsquo;s palm popped
open in the man&rsquo;s forehead.</p>
<p>Zumu watched, queasy and fascinated at the same time, as Mister Fing put
the cane down, put his hat back on, and picked up a pair of pliers.
Muttering to himself, he pried a small piece of stone out of the man&rsquo;s
head. It was the same size and shape as the ruby Mister Fing had just
cut, but as dull as an old brick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that one didn&rsquo;t last long.&rdquo; Mister Fing tossed it over his
shoulder, then took the carved ruby from the workbench and inserted it
carefully into the now-empty slot.</p>
<p>Nothing happened. Mister Fing drummed his fingers on the workbench
impatiently, then slapped the man&rsquo;s cheek, <em>whack whack</em>. &ldquo;Come on,
you stupid robot. Wake up, wake up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man twitched. He blinked his eyes. &ldquo;Why, hello, Mister Fing!&rdquo; he
said brightly. &ldquo;Am I in your workshop again? It is wonderful to be
back! Why, I&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>Mister Fing hastily plucked the ruby out of the man&rsquo;s head. The man&rsquo;s
babbling instantly stopped.</p>
<p>Mister Fing weighed the little gem in his hand. &ldquo;Hmph,&rdquo; he grunted.
&ldquo;Sounds like that one would make you too smart for my own good. And we
can&rsquo;t have that, can we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never know&mdash;you might even need it yourself one day,&rdquo; the
crow&rsquo;s head squawked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut your beak,&rdquo; Mister Fing said sharply. He set the ruby down and
took another one out of the bucket. This one didn&rsquo;t shine nearly as
brightly as the first had. He inserted it into the man&rsquo;s head and
rapped his knuckles on the man&rsquo;s nose as if he was knocking on a door.</p>
<p>The man blinked once again. &ldquo;H-h-hello M-m-mister F-f-f-&rdquo; he
stuttered.</p>
<p>Mister Fing thumped the man&rsquo;s chest. &ldquo;-ing!&rdquo; he finished. &ldquo;Robot
number t-t-two oh seven one seven, reporting f-f-for work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what happened to you this time?&rdquo; Mister Fing demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was p-p-painting!&rdquo; the robot said with an innocent smile. &ldquo;I
l-l-love to p-p-p&mdash; I love to p-p-p&mdash; I love to p-p-p&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mister Fing growled. He yanked the second ruby out of the robot&rsquo;s head
and tossed it back into the bucket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost sunrise,&rdquo; the crow&rsquo;s head said.</p>
<p>Mister Fing glanced at a clock on the wall. &ldquo;So it is.&rdquo; He turned to
the pump on the floor and pulled on a lever. With a choke and a cough,
the pump wheezed into life, <em>ta-pock ta-pock ta-pock</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you last check the telescope&rsquo;s alignment?&rdquo; the crow&rsquo;s head
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me how to do my job,&rdquo; Mister Fing grumbled, but he walked
around the pump and began fiddling with the telescope&rsquo;s controls
anyway.</p>
<p>The clock on the wall went <em>tick, tock, tick, tock, bong!</em> A moment
later the pump&rsquo;s <em>ta-pock ta-pock</em> deepened to a <em>tha-bunk tha-bunk</em>.
The pipe on the floor went <em>clonk</em>, and a spray of light no thicker than
a hair spurted out of a tiny crack in a joint.</p>
<p>Zumu clapped a hand over his mouth to stop himself from shouting. This
was where the light came from! The telescope, or the pump, or
<em>something</em> was sucking it out of the sky!</p>
<p>Outside, Zumu heard a growl, then barking. &ldquo;Are they at each other
<em>again</em>?&rdquo; Mister Fing grumbled. He went to a door on the other side of
the room and left, banging it behind him.</p>
<p>Zumu heaved a sigh of relief. His head felt like it was <em>really</em>
spinning now. It was bad enough that Mister Fing was hoarding all that
light, and throwing away the mushrooms that the villagers gave him, and
doing whatever it was he did to the crows and the people from the town.
No, not people&mdash;what was the word he had used? Robots! Robot with
rubies for brains, and who knew what else? But the light&mdash;Zumu knew
where Mister Fing got his light! He had to get back to the village and
tell everyone!</p>
<p>But would they believe him? He only half believed it himself. He needed
some kind of proof.</p>
<p>The rubies! He could take some of the rubies! That would convince
everyone. And the bottle of light with the squeeze handle, too, so that
he could find his way home.</p>
<p>A rickety metal ladder ran from the walkway to the floor below. Afraid
that Mister Fing might come back at any moment, Zumu scrambled down it
to the floor below and raced over to the workbench.</p>
<p>Just as he reached out to pick up the freshly-carved ruby that lay
there, a rasping voice said, &ldquo;What are you doing, you stupid mammal?
He&rsquo;ll see right away that it&rsquo;s missing!&rdquo;</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Chapter 8</h2>
<p>Zumu jumped. He had forgotten that Mister Fing&rsquo;s walking stick was
lying on the bench!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; Zumu stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful,&rdquo; the crow&rsquo;s head cawed sarcastically. &ldquo;Someone <em>finally</em>
comes to rescue me, and all he can think about is pretty little
gew-gaws. You&rsquo;re worse than my crows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Zumu apologized. &ldquo;I just need something to show to
everyone back in the village, or they&rsquo;ll never believe I was here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crow&rsquo;s head glared at him. &ldquo;What difference will it make if they
believe you? He&rsquo;ll still be here with all the light, and they&rsquo;ll still
be there in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu hesitated. Then his jaw set. &ldquo;Somebody will think of something,&rdquo;
he said. He laid a rag from the workbench on the floor, then knelt
beside the pail and scooped a double handful of rubies onto it.</p>
<p>The crow&rsquo;s head snorted. &ldquo;So, was that you in the back of the wagon?&rdquo;
it asked.</p>
<p>Zumu paused. &ldquo;You knew I was there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course! Fing might be too chalk-headed to notice, but my crows
spotted you when we were on the bridge. You were <em>supposed</em> to rescue me
while they distracted him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Zumu said again. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you needed rescuing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I need rescuing!&rdquo; the crow&rsquo;s head squawked indignantly.
&ldquo;Do you think I <em>like</em> being knocked around whenever Fing feels
grumpy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; Zumu said, tying the rag&rsquo;s corners together to make
a bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no supposing about it,&rdquo; the crow&rsquo;s head snapped as Zumu
straightened up. &ldquo;Now, can you see in the dark? No? Oh, mammals&hellip;
You&rsquo;re useless. Look&mdash;over there, on your left. Take the spray
bottle. He&rsquo;ll probably spend a week looking for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu turned to pick up the bottle of light and jumped a second time. He
was face-to-face with the robot from the wagon. It <em>looked</em> like a
person, except for having no hair, but when he waved his hand in front
of its face, it didn&rsquo;t respond. Zumu suddenly felt sorry for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?!&rdquo; the crow&rsquo;s head squawked as Zumu put the
bottle of light and the bag of rubies on the workbench. &ldquo;Fing could be
back any second!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu ignored the harsh voice. He picked up the brilliant ruby that
Mister Fing had put in the robot&rsquo;s head and then taken out. Standing on
the very tips of his toes, he set it into the slot in the robot&rsquo;s
forehead and closed the hatch.</p>
<p><em>Click.</em> The robot blinked. &ldquo;Good morning, Mister&mdash;hey, you&rsquo;re not
Mister Fing!&rdquo; it said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; Zumu said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip; I&rsquo;m&hellip; I&rsquo;m his assistant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The robot&rsquo;s smile widened. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very pleased to meet you, Mister His
Assistant! I&rsquo;m Number 20717, at your service!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu grinned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very pleased to meet you too, Number 20717. And
I&rsquo;m not a mister&mdash;my name is Zumu. Are you feeling better now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I feel like my brain is practically sizzling! It must be brand
new!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and very shiny,&rdquo; Zumu told it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, I should get back to work!&rdquo; the robot said. &ldquo;I <em>love</em>
working!&rdquo; And with that, it turned and walked away.</p>
<p>Zumu watched it go with a grin. &ldquo;You <em>idiot!</em>&rdquo; the crow&rsquo;s head
hissed. &ldquo;What did you do that for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu shrugged, still grinning. &ldquo;I felt sorry for him, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry for <em>him</em>? How about feeling sorry for <em>me</em>? I&rsquo;m the one who&rsquo;s
stuck in this, this <em>thing</em> instead of in my own head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your own head?&rdquo; Zumu asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course my own head,&rdquo; the crow spluttered indignantly. &ldquo;This stick
is only supposed to be for temporary storage while I was being repaired,
but oh, someone got clever, didn&rsquo;t he? Oh yes, and someone&rsquo;s going to
be very, very sorry, I can promise you that. Now, quick! Take me outside
and put me back where I belong, and I&rsquo;ll let you have half of the light
in the storage tanks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half the light?&rdquo; Zumu gasped, stunned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so you&rsquo;re greedy, are you?&rdquo; the crow&rsquo;s head sneered. &ldquo;You want
it all for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not what I meant. It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s <em>everybody&rsquo;s</em> light, not
just mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine&mdash; share it with them if you want!&rdquo; the crow&rsquo;s head squawked
frantically. &ldquo;Just get me out of this thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu nodded. &ldquo;All right.&rdquo; He reached for the cane.</p>
<p>And at that precise moment, Mister Fing bellowed, &ldquo;Get away from
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu whirled around. Mister Fing was standing in the doorway on the
other side of the room holding a mismatched pair of legs. He dropped
them on the floor and grabbed an enormous sledgehammer.</p>
<p>As quick as a bat, Zumu ran three steps toward the ladder. But wait! The
light! And the rubies! He turned back and grabbed the bottle and his
rag-bag. As he spun around again, the knot in the rag came undone.
Sparkling red stones clattered onto the floor.</p>
<p>Zumu didn&rsquo;t stop to pick them up. He scrambled up the ladder like a
squirrel. Behind him, the crow&rsquo;s head squawked, &ldquo;Thief! Thief! Oh, I
tried to stop him, honest I did!&rdquo; as Mister Fing yelled, &ldquo;Stop! Stop,
or I&rsquo;ll put the snarly-dogs on you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu&rsquo;s feet went <em>clonk, clonk, clonk</em> on the walkway as he ran for the
exit. Mister Fing bellowed behind him once more as the crow&rsquo;s head
squawked and cawed, &ldquo;Thief! Thief! Oh, you wretched mammal, bring that
back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heavy boots clonked on the metal ladder behind him as he reached the
outside door. He turned its handle as gently as he could and peeked
outside.</p>
<p>The lights beside the storage tanks were still glowing. And the
snarly-dogs were still snoring on the ground beside the wagon. One of
them snuffled in its sleep as Mister Fing shouted again. He had to move
fast!</p>
<p>He tiptoed across the gravel to the back of the wagon and pushed. It
didn&rsquo;t budge. The blocks! He had forgotten about the blocks! Faintly,
he heard Mister Fing bellow again inside the observatory. Another
snarly-dog twitched its ears.</p>
<p>Zumu ran around the wagon, kicking the blocks out of the way, then put
his shoulder against it and pushed again. &ldquo;Come on, come on!&rdquo; he
whimpered. His feet slipped. He dug in and pushed with all his might.
His feet slipped again on the gravel. He fell to one knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come <em>on</em>,&rdquo; he whispered frantically. He stood up and put his whole
weight against the wagon.</p>
<p>It moved an inch, then stopped and rolled back. Zumu pushed again,
rocking it back and forth. Once, twice, three times&hellip;</p>
<p>The wagon rolled forward instead of slipping back. Gravel crunched under
its wheels. Zumu&rsquo;s feet slipped again, but this time he didn&rsquo;t fall.</p>
<p>Suddenly the wagon&rsquo;s wheels were off the gravel and onto the road. It
picked up speed as the incline tugged at it, slowly, then faster, until
Zumu was jogging to keep up, faster and faster and&mdash;</p>
<p>The door burst open behind him. &ldquo;Wake up you stupid&rdquo; <em>kick</em> &ldquo;lazy&rdquo;
<em>kick</em> &ldquo;ugly&rdquo; <em>kick</em> &ldquo;warty&rdquo; <em>kick</em> &ldquo;drooling&rdquo; <em>kick</em> &ldquo;smelly
things and <em>get him!</em>&rdquo; Mister Fing roared.</p>
<p>Zumu scrambled over the backboard and glanced back just in time to see
the snarly-dogs surge to their feet. They snuffled at the ground to pick
up a scent. A moment later one of them yelped. &ldquo;Yes, yes, go, go!&rdquo;
Mister Fing shouted, kicking the nearest snarly-dog in the rump. They
scrambled over one another and raced after the wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh oh,&rdquo; Zumu said out loud. He squeezed between the steel drums and
hopped onto the front seat, setting the bottle of light beside him, then
twisted around to look back again. The snarly-dogs were getting closer.
He slapped the seat with his hand as if that would make the wagon go
faster. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; he told it. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wagon was moving quickly now, but the snarly-dogs were quicker
still. They yelped and howled as they raced toward it, their fangs
gleaming in the dregs of light that spittered and spattered from the
drums behind Zumu.</p>
<p>But then the road got steeper, and the wagon&rsquo;s wheels spun faster and
faster. The snarly-dogs howled with disappointment as it pulled away
from them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woo hoo!&rdquo; Zumu shouted as the wagon hurtled down the narrow road, a
steep cliff on one side, an old wooden railing on the other. The wind
blew through his hair. He had done it! He had escaped!</p>
<p><em>Bang!</em> The wagon hit a bump. Zumu was nearly thrown off the seat.
&ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; he exclaimed. He put the bottle of light between his knees and
grabbed hold of the bench with both hands. All of a sudden, he realized
he had no idea how to steer the wagon. Or stop it.</p>
<p><em>Thump!</em> The wagon hit another bump so hard that it bounced up onto two
wheels. Zumu leaned to the side to keep his balance. As he did so, his
elbow hit the bottle&rsquo;s squeeze handle. Light sprayed onto his face,
into his hair, and right up his nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Achoo!&rdquo; Zumu sneezed a big glowing sneeze down the front of his
shirt. The bottle slipped out from between his knees, rattling and
clanging on the road behind him.</p>
<p>The wagon fell back onto all four wheels. Little speckles of light
danced in front of him, even as the gooey glow on his shirt began to
fade. Zumu wiped the light from his eyes with his sleeve and blinked.</p>
<p>There, right in front of him, the road bent sharply to the right.
&ldquo;Aaaaaaah!&rdquo; he shouted. The wagon wasn&rsquo;t going to turn! It was going
to&mdash;</p>
<p><em>CRASH!</em> Straight through the railing and over the side of the cliff!</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Chapter 9</h2>
<p>The wagon hurtled through the air. Zumu screamed in terror. The wind
whistled past his ears&mdash;except it was really his ears whistling past
the wind. All he could think was, <em>Now I&rsquo;ll never get to meet the new
baby.</em></p>
<p>But suddenly, hundreds of small wings fluttered over his head. Dozens of
sharp claws dug into his shoulders. It was the crows! They had caught
him in mid-air!</p>
<p>The wagon fell away beneath him to tumble end over end through the air.
He heard it smash into the ground far below. <em>FLASH!</em> The drums of light
burst, spilling their last dregs of light into the sky. Wagon wheels and
broken boards bounced down the mountainside, <em>clunk, bonk, kerthump</em>.</p>
<p>Zumu dangled in the darkness, kicking helplessly at the nothingness
under his feet. The flapping of the crows&rsquo; wings as they struggled with
his weight sounded like the leaves of a hundred storm-lashed trees.</p>
<p>Something hit Zumu&rsquo;s left foot, then scraped sharply along his shin. It
was a branch! The crows dropped Zumu into a tree. He clutched at it to
stop himself from falling to the ground. The bark scratched his face,
but he didn&rsquo;t care. His heart was kicking in his chest like a baby
rabbit.</p>
<p>As he took a shaky breath, Zumu heard snuffling and growling below. &ldquo;Oh
no,&rdquo; he moaned softly.</p>
<p>The snarly-dogs&rsquo; claws went <em>clack, clack, clack</em> on the road. They
whuffled and whined as they sniffed at the broken railing.</p>
<p>Zumu held his breath and clung to his tree. He felt it tremble. For a
moment he thought that it was afraid of the snarly-dogs too, but then he
realized that <em>he</em> was the one who was shaking.</p>
<p>Zumu didn&rsquo;t move when the snarly-dogs turned and trotted back up the
road. He didn&rsquo;t move when he could no longer hear their claws. He
didn&rsquo;t even move once he could no longer hear them growling. Instead,
he waited for his arms and legs to stop shaking. Only then did he climb
down and sit on the ground with his back against the tree.</p>
<p>Without warning, hot tears welled up in his eyes. He screwed up his
face, but a single sob escaped him, then another. It wasn&rsquo;t
fair&mdash;he&rsquo;d only been trying to make things right for Wumingu. He
didn&rsquo;t want to be here, miles away from home, chased by hungry
snarly-dogs, falling off the side of a mountain, stuck in the dark with
no light, no friends, and no idea what to do next. He just wanted to go
home. His mother and father would be so worried&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just want to go home,&rdquo; he whispered wretchedly. &ldquo;Please,
somebody&hellip;&rdquo; He kicked his heels against the ground a couple of times,
wishing that he could just snap his fingers and whistle like the
magicians in his father&rsquo;s bed-time stories.</p>
<p>That thought made him shake his head angrily and wipe the tears off his
cheeks. This wasn&rsquo;t a story. And crying wasn&rsquo;t going to help&mdash;no
one was going to appear out of nowhere and set things right for him. He
was on his own. Whatever happened next was up to him.</p>
<p>He took a shaky breath and let it out with a whoosh. Slowly, carefully,
he began to empty out his pockets. Two halves of a broken shoestring:
they wouldn&rsquo;t be much help. A stick shaped like a perfect &lsquo;Y&rsquo; that he
was keeping as a present for the baby-to-be.</p>
<p>And&mdash;he froze. Granna Ipwepu&rsquo;s thimble&mdash;he still had it.</p>
<p>He ran his thumb over it very gently. The acorn cap was still in place.
There might still be some light inside!</p>
<p>His heart sank. Granna Ipwepu had only given him three drops. They
wouldn&rsquo;t get him very far. If only he hadn&rsquo;t dropped the bottle from
Mister Fing&rsquo;s workshop. There was plenty of light in it&hellip;</p>
<p>Wait a second. The bottle could have bounced almost anywhere after he
dropped it. <em>But then it would roll downhill</em>. He stood up carefully
with the thimble in his fist, then walked slowly down the road until he
felt it level off. &ldquo;Please, please, please,&rdquo; he whispered. If the
bottle had gone over the cliff like the wagon, he&rsquo;d never get home. He
raised the thimble up as high as he could and pulled off its acorn cap.</p>
<p><em>Plip.</em> The first drop of light fell from the thimble. Zumu looked
around wildly. Nothing!</p>
<p><em>Plip.</em> The second drop of light sparked and faded away. He couldn&rsquo;t
see it! He couldn&rsquo;t see the bottle!</p>
<p><em>Plip.</em> Nothing! No, wait&mdash;over there! There it was, just a few feet
away from him, caught against the railing on the side of the road!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he breathed. He put the thimble back in his pocket,
walked carefully over to where he had seen the bottle, and knelt down to
pat the ground. His fingers brushed against something solid and heavy.</p>
<p>Zumu heaved a sigh of relief and hugged the bottle to his chest, then
grinned a huge grin. Leaping to his feet, he squirted some light into
the sky.</p>
<p>And froze. Hundreds of crows covered the branches of the trees around
him like black snowflakes. Their beady black eyes glittered in the
light.</p>
<p>Zumu gulped. &ldquo;I guess the crow&rsquo;s head told you to save me,&rdquo; he said
uncertainly. &ldquo;Can&mdash;can you talk?&rdquo; The crows didn&rsquo;t answer.</p>
<p>He waited a moment longer, then shrugged. His father always said that
the best time to do something you really didn&rsquo;t want to do was
yesterday. If it was too late to do it then, you might as well do it
right away. He began trudging wearily down the mountain, spraying a
little light in front of himself now and again so that he could see the
way.</p>
<p>Zumu barely glanced up when the first glass bulb came to life over his
head. All he thought was, <em>Well, that&rsquo;ll save some of my light.</em> He
didn&rsquo;t look up at all for the second light, or the third, or the ones
after that. After everything he had seen that day, they didn&rsquo;t seem
wonderful any more.</p>
<p>He was underneath the thirteenth light when he saw a robot sweeping the
sidewalk in front of him. It stopped and waved. &ldquo;Hello, Mister&hellip;&rdquo; it
began cheerfully, but its voice trailed off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello yourself,&rdquo; Zumu muttered. The robot stared at him as he walked
by. Lost in misery, Zumu didn&rsquo;t pay it any attention until he heard its
heavy footsteps behind him. The robot was following him! A cold chill
ran down his spine. He picked up his pace but did not look back.</p>
<p>Soon Zumu was walking past other robots. None of them said hello or
waved. Instead, they put down whatever they were doing and joined the
growing crowd behind him. As he trudged along, they started whispering.
&ldquo;Stranger&hellip; Stranger&hellip; He&rsquo;s not one of us&hellip; He&rsquo;s not supposed
to be here&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whispering grew louder as he approached the center of town. He
stopped short when he reached the main square. More robots were already
there, blocking his way. &ldquo;Stranger&hellip; Stranger&hellip;&rdquo; they whispered
menacingly. He was surrounded!</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Chapter 10</h2>
<p>Zumu looked around wildly. There was nowhere for him to run.
&ldquo;Stranger&hellip; stranger&hellip;&rdquo; The robots&rsquo; bald heads and fixed smiles
were as frightening as the snarly-dogs&rsquo; fangs and claws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Act brave,&rdquo; he whispered under his breath. It was what his father had
said the first time he came home in tears after being bullied by
Wumingu. &ldquo;If you act brave, they&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;re brave, and then
you&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;re brave too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu squared his shoulders and walked toward the fountain in the middle
of the square as if no one else were there. &ldquo;Stranger&hellip;
stranger&hellip;&rdquo; the robots whispered. Zumu started whistling to drown
them out, swinging the bottle of light casually at his side.</p>
<p>The robots shuffled closer. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not supposed to be here,&rdquo; said one.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not one of us,&rdquo; said another.</p>
<p>Zumu kept whistling. Just as he reached the edge of the fountain, a
louder voice said, &ldquo;Why, hello, Zumu!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu whirled around&mdash;and bumped into the edge of the shallow pool
that surrounded the fountain. &ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; <em>Splash!</em> Over the edge he went,
right into the cold water.</p>
<p>He spluttered back to his feet, still clutching the bottle of light.
Robot #20717 was standing right there in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t a stranger!&rdquo; the robot told the others. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s Mister
Fing&rsquo;s assistant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other robots instantly stopped whispering. &ldquo;Hello, Mister Fing&rsquo;s
assistant!&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um, hello,&rdquo; Zumu said. He set the bottle of light down on the edge of
the fountain and wiped the water from his face. The robots were all
smiling now, but none as broadly as #20717.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He gave me a new brain today,&rdquo; #20717 told the crowd. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been
giving me all kinds of new thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um, great.&rdquo; Zumu&rsquo;s sandals squelched on the pavement as he stepped
out of the fountain pool. His wet shirt and pants felt cold against his
skin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have some new jobs for us to do?&rdquo; #20717 asked eagerly. &ldquo;Is
that why Mister Fing sent you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mister Fing didn&rsquo;t send me,&rdquo; Zumu said without thinking. The robots
around him instantly stopped smiling. <em>Whoops,</em> Zumu thought. <em>That
wasn&rsquo;t the right thing to say.</em></p>
<p>#20717 frowned. &ldquo;But&hellip; if Mister Fing didn&rsquo;t send you, why are you
here?&rdquo; it asked slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um&hellip;it&rsquo;s a surprise!&rdquo; Zumu replied quickly.</p>
<p>#20717&rsquo;s frown deepened. &ldquo;Mister Fing doesn&rsquo;t like surprises. He
says that sometimes. He says, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like surprises.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll like this one,&rdquo; Zumu said, forcing a smile onto his face.
&ldquo;But for now, everyone should get back to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moment he said &lsquo;work&rsquo;, all the robots turned and started to walk
away. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t say anything to Mister Fing about seeing me!&rdquo; Zumu
called after them. &ldquo;That would spoil the surprise for sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they walked away, Zumu let out a big sigh. &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; he said, picking
up his bottle and trotting after #20717. &ldquo;Two oh seven one seven!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The robot turned around. &ldquo;Yes? What can I do for you today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, uh, I need someone to help me organize Mister Fing&rsquo;s surprise,&rdquo;
Zumu said, feeling a little guilty at the lie, &ldquo;But it has to be
someone extra smart. Do you think your new brain is up to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you, my new brain is excellent!&rdquo; the robot said proudly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so excellent, I can even use words like &lsquo;excellent&rsquo;
properly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu smiled. &ldquo;All right. But I still have to test you. Here&rsquo;s the
first question: How long have you been here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fourteen and a half seconds,&rdquo; the robot replied promptly.</p>
<p>Zumu laughed. &ldquo;No, no, I don&rsquo;t mean right <em>here</em>. I mean, how long
have you been living in this town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For years and years, I think,&rdquo; the robot said. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t
remember exactly. My brain has been replaced several times. I don&rsquo;t
have all of my memories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Zumu said. &ldquo;Now, question number two: Where did
you come from? Not just a few seconds ago,&rdquo; he added hastily as the
robot opened its mouth to answer. &ldquo;I mean years and years ago. Do you
know how you got here? Or where you were before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The robot was silent for a long moment. &ldquo;It was dark,&rdquo; it said slowly.
&ldquo;And we were all together, waiting. But then Mister Fing saved us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saved you from what?&rdquo; Zumu asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the monsters,&rdquo; the robot whispered. &ldquo;Out there, where Mister
Fing goes. If he didn&rsquo;t take them some light every week, they would
strip us down for spare parts, and take out our brains, and never, ever
let us work again.&rdquo; It shivered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s very brave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Zumu exclaimed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not&mdash;he doesn&rsquo;t give the light
to any monsters! He gives it to us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as he said it, Zumu realized he&rsquo;d made a mistake. The robot
frowned. &ldquo;What do you mean, &lsquo;us&rsquo;?&rdquo; it asked slowly. Then its frown
deepened. &ldquo;Unless&hellip; unless <em>you&rsquo;re</em> one of the monsters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Zumu said in his friendliest voice (even though his heart
was racing). He spread his arms. &ldquo;Do I <em>look</em> like a monster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the robot said suspiciously. &ldquo;What do monsters look
like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu forced himself to laugh. &ldquo;Well, for a start, they&rsquo;re a lot bigger
than me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the little flying ones,&rdquo; the robot said, still suspicious. &ldquo;They
spy on us all the time. We&rsquo;re supposed to swat them with our rakes and
our brooms whenever we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the crows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shhh!&rdquo; The robot looked around. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not supposed to talk about
them. Mister Fing was <em>very</em> clear about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. But what about the other monsters? Have you ever seen
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The robot shook its head. &ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t. Have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu took a deep breath. &ldquo;No. And do you know what? I don&rsquo;t think
they&rsquo;re real. I think Mister Fing just made them up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The robot&rsquo;s eyes widened. Its jaw dropped. Then it smiled and said,
&ldquo;Ha ha ha!&rdquo; just like that&mdash;not a real laugh at all, just, &ldquo;Ha ha
ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you laughing?&rdquo; Zumu said crossly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious! I think
Mister Fing made it up, just to scare you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To scare us?&rdquo; the robot gasped. &ldquo;Mister Fing wouldn&rsquo;t do that!
He&rsquo;s our friend! Why, without him, who would tell us which houses to
paint? Or when to sweep the leaves off the streets! Who would we say
&lsquo;hello&rsquo; to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he made it aaaallll up,&rdquo; Zumu repeated firmly. &ldquo;And I can
prove it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; the robot asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, we&rsquo;ll need to get some more light,&rdquo; Zumu said. &ldquo;Lots more
light, because we&rsquo;ll have to walk a long way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down the mountain,&rdquo; Zumu said. &ldquo;And then there&rsquo;s a bridge, and then
we go back up the mountain on the other side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then what?&rdquo; the robot asked in a hushed voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then I&rsquo;ll show you that there aren&rsquo;t any monsters,&rdquo; Zumu said.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s just people like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t just go,&rdquo; the robot protested. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m supposed to be
painting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you don&rsquo;t come with me, you&rsquo;ll never find out whether there
really are any monsters,&rdquo; Zumu pointed out.</p>
<p>The robot hesitated. <em>Come on, give in,</em> Zumu pleaded silently. <em>I know
that new brain of yours is curious.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; the robot finally said. &ldquo;I know where the light for the
streetlights is. We can get some of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a streetlight?&rdquo; Zumu asked.</p>
<p>The robot pointed. &ldquo;The big lights up there. Don&rsquo;t you have them where
you come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have lights like that at all,&rdquo; Zumu said. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t
enough light in the whole village for one of those.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The robot showed Zumu a storage tank on the edge of the square. After
Zumu topped up his bottle, the robot took a square can from a pile
beside the tank and filled it as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess we&rsquo;re set,&rdquo; Zumu said. He was terribly hungry, but
somehow he didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d like whatever robots ate&mdash;if they ate
at all.</p>
<p>They set off down the road together. Zumu felt as if he ought to make
conversation, but he couldn&rsquo;t think of anything to say. The robot still
had a frown on its face. It seemed to be thinking about what Zumu had
told it.</p>
<p>Suddenly the robot stopped. &ldquo;I just had an idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Zumu asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if I carried you? We could go a lot faster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t I be too heavy for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; the robot said. As quick as a bee, it picked him
up and slung him over its shoulder like a sack full of mushrooms. &ldquo;Why,
you hardly weigh anything!&rdquo; the robot said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put me down!&rdquo; Zumu exclaimed. The robot dumped him on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; the robot asked.</p>
<p>Zumu stood up, rubbing his elbow where it had hit the pavement. &ldquo;That
hurt,&rdquo; Zumu told it angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is &lsquo;hurt&rsquo;?&rdquo; the robot asked.</p>
<p>Zumu stared at it, then sighed and shook his head. &ldquo;Never mind. But
there&rsquo;s a better way for you to carry me. Turn around. Good. Now put
your arms out&mdash;no, not like that, just at your sides, but with a bit
of space. Ready? One&hellip; two&hellip; three!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu jumped up onto the robot&rsquo;s back and put his arms around its neck
so that he was riding piggy-back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this right?&rdquo; the robot asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great,&rdquo; Zumu said. He wriggled a bit so that his legs were
tucked right in against the robot. &ldquo;Now, can you pick up the light?&rdquo;
The robot bent its knees, grabbed the bottle and the can, then
straightened up again. &ldquo;Good! Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; The robot took a step, then
another, then leaned forward and ran down the winding mountain road.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Chapter 11</h2>
<p>Zumu quickly discovered that piggy-backing on a robot was a lot bumpier
than lying in the back of Mister Fing&rsquo;s wagon. And unlike the
snarly-dogs,</p>
<p>the robot didn&rsquo;t seem to get tired. Every hundred steps or so Zumu
sprayed a few drops of light into the air in front of them. The robot
seemed to remember everything it saw, even in a single glance, so that
most of their journey was in darkness.</p>
<p>Up close, it was easy to tell that the robot wasn&rsquo;t a person. Its skin
smelled faintly like machine oil, and its muscles were as hard as wood.
<em>It&rsquo;s not like riding on my father&rsquo;s back at all</em>, Zumu thought. He
had done that when he was little, as a special treat. His father would
feel his way along the path-string with Zumu&rsquo;s arms around his neck as
they counted out the knots together.</p>
<p>After a while, Zumu&rsquo;s shoulders ached, until his arms felt like they
were being jolted out of their sockets, but he kept holding on. Just a
little while longer, and he&rsquo;d be home.</p>
<p>They wound their way down to the bottom of the mountain. The road
leveled off as they came out of the forest. Zumu listened for the
crows&rsquo; wings, but all he heard was the <em>thomp thomp thomp</em> of the
robot&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p><em>Thomp thomp thomp</em>, and then a hollow <em>plunt plunt plunt</em> as they
crossed the bridge. Zumu&rsquo;s heart skipped a beat. They were halfway
home! For a moment he forgot about the gnawing, grumbling emptiness in
his stomach, the ache in his shoulders, and the bruises forming on his
legs where the robot&rsquo;s arms gripped him. He was halfway back to his
mother and father and the baby-to-be.</p>
<p>Zumu sprayed light more frequently as they wound back and forth up the
mountain. His excitement grew with each turn in the road as he thought
about all the things he had discovered. He imagined himself in the
middle of the square, right where Mister Fing usually parked his wagon.
&ldquo;He just throws them all away,&rdquo; he would tell the hushed crowd. &ldquo;And
then he goes back to the town where we all used to live and sucks all
the light out of the sky so that there&rsquo;s none left for us!&rdquo; He
imagined himself handing the spare can of light to Wumingu, just to show
how big-hearted he was. And then&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, he wasn&rsquo;t quite sure what would happen after that. Would the
grown-ups march to town and break open his storage tanks? Would they
have enough light to get there, or would #20717 show them the way? And
what would the other robots do when they showed up? If they were all as
strong as #20717, they could easily turn the villagers away. And what
about the snarly-dogs?</p>
<p>Zumu shook his head. He would let the grown-ups figure it all out. Right
now, he just wanted a dozen fried peppers for dinner and his own bed.</p>
<p>The robot jogged around another bend in the road. Zumu sprayed another
few drops of light into the air in front of them, then gasped. That was
the bell the teenagers rang when they saw Mister Fing coming! The
village must be just around the corner!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! Stop!&rdquo; Zumu said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; the robot asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put me down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The robot dropped Zumu on the ground with a whump. &ldquo;Ow,&rdquo; Zumu
whimpered, rubbing his tailbone and stretching. His arms were still
attached, but just barely, and his legs felt like someone had been
whacking them with a big stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; #20717 asked anxiously. &ldquo;Do you need to be
oiled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No thanks, I&rsquo;m all right.&rdquo; Zumu straightened up. He didn&rsquo;t see any
reason to add that being carried into the village didn&rsquo;t seem very
dignified. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re almost there. We&rsquo;re almost home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where the monsters are?&rdquo; #20717 asked in a hushed voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any monsters!&rdquo; Zumu said, exasperated. The light he had
sprayed had faded, but he waved his arms in the darkness anyway,
forgetting for a moment that the robot could not see him. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
just people like me! They won&rsquo;t hurt you. Come on, you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to take longer to reach the last bend in the road than it had
taken to come all the way from town. Zumu didn&rsquo;t need to use any more
light as they walked. He could feel the ruts from Mister Fing&rsquo;s
wagon&rsquo;s wheels under his feet, and the robot could follow the sound of
his footsteps.</p>
<p>The ruts bent sharply to the right. He started to walk faster, the
bottle of light bumping against his leg. He could almost feel the hug
his mother was going to give him. He could practically&mdash;</p>
<p>The robot suddenly grabbed Zumu&rsquo;s arm. Startled, Zumu almost jumped out
of his skin. &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; #20717 whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was what?&rdquo; Zumu whispered back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard something,&rdquo; the robot said. &ldquo;Over there in the trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear anything. Come on, let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Please, wait.&rdquo; Zumu felt the robot&rsquo;s hand tremble. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I
think I&rsquo;m scared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you, there&rsquo;s nothing to be scared of,&rdquo; Zumu said. He shook
the robot&rsquo;s hand off his arm. &ldquo;Do all robots get frightened this
easily?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; #20717 said. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s because of my new brain. It can
imagine all sorts of things I could never have thought of before, and
they&rsquo;re all horrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmph,&rdquo; Zumu said. &ldquo;Well, I&mdash; &ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is again!&rdquo; #20717 whispered urgently, squeezing Zumu&rsquo;s arm
so hard that it hurt. &ldquo;Did you hear it this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough, Zumu <em>had</em> heard something rustling in the trees. Suddenly
he was as frightened as #20717. Could Mister Fing somehow have gotten
ahead of them? Was one of his snarly-dogs snuffling around in the forest
trying to find them?</p>
<p>He aimed the nozzle on the bottle in his hand at the sound, then
hesitated. The sound had turned into someone muttering. It was Granna
Ipwepu, talking to herself as she walked alone through the woods!</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a monster,&rdquo; Zumu said, relieved. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just Granna
Ipwepu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a grannapwy pooh?&rdquo; #20717 asked. &ldquo;Does it bite?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only sometimes,&rdquo; Zumu joked, thinking about the time Granna Ipwepu
had taken her false teeth out to show him. He had been six years old,
and he had shrieked and laughed when she snapped them at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this going to be one of those times?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I was just&mdash;never mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu thought quickly. He couldn&rsquo;t hear her any longer, but she must be
following a path-string, which meant they must be near her house. He
stepped forward cautiously with his arm in front of him until he felt a
tree, then sprayed a few drops of light so that he could check his
guess. There&mdash;a path-string dangled between two gnarly old pines a
dozen steps away. He wondered if Granna Ipwepu knew how close her daily
walk took her to the road that led back to her old home.</p>
<p>Zumu took small, careful steps until he could touch the path-string.
&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said to #20717, guiding the robot&rsquo;s hand to the it.
&ldquo;Just hold onto that. I&rsquo;ll show you who Granna Ipwepu is. <em>Then</em>
you&rsquo;ll see that there aren&rsquo;t any monsters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu knew this path so well that he could have run all the way to Granna
Ipwepu&rsquo;s without any light at all. Instead, he walked slowly, chewing
his lip. The more he rehearsed his story in his head, the more like a
dream it seemed&hellip;</p>
<p>The path-string ran straight, then right, right again, left, and up a
little rise. At its end were four round beads and two square ones worn
smooth with age. They were at Granna Ipwepu&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Zumu took a deep breath and knocked on the door. &ldquo;Granna!&rdquo; he called.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, Zumu!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who? Zumu? Zumu!&rdquo; Floorboards creaked as she got up out of her
rocking chair. The door flew open. Zumu suddenly found himself wrapped
in a fierce hug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Zumu,&rdquo; Granna Ipwepu sniffled. &ldquo;What happened? I told your
father I&rsquo;d given you some light, and you were right there on the
path-string&mdash;how could you have gotten lost? And how did you find
your way back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get lost, Granna,&rdquo; Zumu said. &ldquo;I went to get some more
light from Mister Fing. And you&rsquo;ll never guess what I found!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Granna Ipwepu let go of him. Zumu could almost hear her frown
in the darkness. &ldquo;You went to get some more light? What foolishness is
this? Is this another one of your stories?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, I did, really!&rdquo; Zumu insisted. &ldquo;I jumped in the back of his
wagon and went all the way back to town. That&rsquo;s where he lives, Granna,
in the town from your stories. I saw it, with houses and lights and
everything! And you&rsquo;ll never guess what else I found. Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu lifted up the can of light and sprayed a whole cupful into the air.
<em>Splurt!</em> Granna Ipwepu&rsquo;s jaw dropped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; #20717 said uncertainly, raising his hand to wave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; Granna Ipwepu shrieked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s them! They&rsquo;ve found us!
Aaaaaah!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Zumu said. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t hurt you!&rdquo; But it was too late. Granna
Ipwepu slammed the door shut, then yanked it open again to grab Zumu&rsquo;s
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get inside! Get inside!&rdquo; she said frantically, pulling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granna, stop!&rdquo; Zumu jerked away from her so hard that he fell down on
the path at the robot&rsquo;s feet. Granna Ipwepu stooped over to pick up a
handful of stones and threw them at the robot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get back! Get back, you loathsome thing!&rdquo; she cried. The stones
bounced off the robot&rsquo;s head and chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granna, stop, please!&rdquo; Zumu pleaded again. This wasn&rsquo;t what was
supposed to happen!</p>
<p>Granna Ipwepu stooped over to pick up more stones. At the same instant,
the robot stepped forward to help Zumu to his feet, so that when Granna
Ipwepu straightened up, the robot was right in front of her!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aaagh!&rdquo; she shrieked, stumbling back in fright. Her foot slipped on
the loose stones beneath her. As she fell, her head hit the door frame
with a sickening <em>crack!</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Granna!&rdquo; Zumu exclaimed. He knelt down beside her and took her hand
just as the last of the light faded away.</p>
<p>For one gut-wrenching moment Zumu couldn&rsquo;t find her pulse. There! There
it was&mdash;fast but strong. He heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me get her into the house,&rdquo; he said. No one answered.</p>
<p>Zumu twisted around. &ldquo;Two oh seven one seven? Where are you?&rdquo; He
listened as hard as he could but couldn&rsquo;t hear a sound. The robot had
vanished.</p>
<p>Like every other child in the village, Zumu had been taught what to do
if something as bad as this ever happened. He couldn&rsquo;t feel any blood,
and Granna Ipwepu was breathing: that was step one. Step two: were there
any grownups around? No. All right, he thought, step three: find some.
He closed his eyes for a moment and tried to remember where he had been
standing, and where Granna Ipwepu had been. If she was <em>here</em>, then he
had been <em>there</em>, so the bottle of light must be&hellip;</p>
<p>Zumu twisted around and swept his hand over the gravel. There it was! He
picked it up and squeezed the trigger handle. A few precious drops
spluttered onto Granna Ipwepu&rsquo;s front door before the can gurgled and
hissed. It was empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, great,&rdquo; he muttered, but there was no time to feel sorry for
himself. He would have to leave Granna Ipwepu on her own and go for
help.</p>
<p>But where was #20717? Zumu closed his eyes and listened once again.
&ldquo;Are you there?&rdquo; he asked uncertainly. &ldquo;Two oh seven one seven?&rdquo; All
he could hear were forest sounds: leaves rustling in the wind, the
stream gurgling in the distance. He got to his feet and grabbed the
path-string tied next to Granna Ipwepu&rsquo;s door. He would worry about the
robot later.</p>
<p>Zumu ran through the forest so fast that the path-string practically
sizzled through his fingers. Seventy-one&hellip; seventy-two&hellip;
seventy-three&hellip; went the knots.</p>
<p>Suddenly he heard a voice up ahead. &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Is anyone
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zumu! Is that you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo; he shouted back. &ldquo;Come quick! Granna Ipwepu&rsquo;s hurt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The path-string twitched as someone walked toward him. &ldquo;Zumu? Where are
you?&rdquo; It was Mister Kalimu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m right in front of you,&rdquo; he said, reaching out along the string.</p>
<p>The schoolteacher found Zumu&rsquo;s hand on the string and grabbed hold.
&ldquo;Zumu, where have you been?&rdquo; he said harshly. &ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s been
looking for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went to get some light from Mister Fing,&rdquo; Zumu said. &ldquo;But
then&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did what?!&rdquo; the teacher exclaimed. He squeezed Zumu&rsquo;s hand so
hard it hurt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; Zumu said frantically. &ldquo;You have to come quickly.
Granna Ipwepu fell and hit her head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; the schoolteacher asked. Bumps on heads were
something he understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The robot scared her. And I think she scared the robot, too. It ran
off. But it didn&rsquo;t do anything to her, I promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robot? Zumu, what are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, you <em>have</em> to come!&rdquo; Zumu pleaded, pulling Mister Kalimu
toward Granna Ipwepu&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;Please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The schoolteacher blew three sharp blasts on his whistle. &ldquo;Over here!&rdquo;
he bellowed as loudly as he could. &ldquo;I found him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other whistles answered almost instantly from among the trees around
them. &ldquo;Is it four round and two square?&rdquo; the schoolteacher demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Zumu replied, massaging his hand where the teacher had squeezed
it. Mister Kalimu blew his whistle again, <em>phweet phweet phweet phweet</em>,
pause, <em>phoot phoot</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Show me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They hurried back to Granna&rsquo;s house. The moment he felt the beads, Zumu
said, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s just in front of the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The schoolteacher stopped. Zumu heard the tiny pop of a cork. A single
drop of light flashed beside him, casting shadows back into the
darkness.</p>
<p>Granna Ipwepu was lying right where Zumu had left her. &ldquo;Oh my,&rdquo; the
schoolteacher said, letting go of the path-string and kneeling beside
the old woman.</p>
<p>Zumu knelt next to her as well and held his breath. After a moment the
schoolteacher said, &ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s all right. Is her door open?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu reached out to check. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Help me get her inside.&rdquo; The schoolteacher dribbled
another drop of light onto the ground, then took hold of Granna
Ipwepu&rsquo;s shoulders. With a gulp, Zumu grabbed her ankles. Her legs were
as skinny as a chicken&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>They laid her on top of it&rsquo;s the neatly-folded blankets on her bed.
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; the schoolteacher said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be all right for the
moment. Now tell me, where have you been hiding? Everybody has been
looking for you&mdash;the whole village! And your mother and father have
been frantic!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you, I wanted to get some light from Mister Fing,&rdquo; Zumu said.
&ldquo;For the baby. So I hid in his wagon, but he just threw the mushrooms
away. And then&mdash;he uses the rubies to make brains for his
robots&mdash;the ones in the town. And he lives in a big building with a
telescope, and he uses it to take all the light out of the sky, but when
I tried to get away, the wagon went right off the cliff, but the crows
put me in a tree, and&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zumu!&rdquo; the schoolteacher broke in sharply. &ldquo;Do you have any idea how
much trouble you&rsquo;re in? Lots, that&rsquo;s how much, lots and lots. And do
you think that telling a mish-mash story like this is going to make
things better, or get you in deeper? Hm? It&rsquo;s going to get you in
deeper, isn&rsquo;t it? Now, where were you really? And why did you run
away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t run away!&rdquo; Zumu protested. &ldquo;I told you, I just wanted
to get some light. Wumingu spilled ours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wumingu said you two had a fight,&rdquo; the teacher said grimly. &ldquo;About
what happened in the square. He said you were making fun of him, and
showing off how much light you had, but then you dropped your bottle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Zumu was stunned. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what happened! I told him he
could have some of ours, because he only got one drop, but then he made
me drop the bottle. That&rsquo;s why I went after Mister Fing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zumu&hellip;&rdquo; his teacher growled. Zumu opened his mouth to protest once
again, but as he did so a whistle went <em>phweet!</em> outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re inside the house!&rdquo; the teacher shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zumu?&rdquo; It was his father. A moment later Zumu was wrapped in the
biggest hug of his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Zumu, we were so scared,&rdquo; his father said, squeezing so hard that
his son&rsquo;s ribs creaked. &ldquo;Your mother and I were so, so scared. Where
have you been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip;&rdquo; came a weak voice from the bed. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granna! Are you all right?&rdquo; Zumu&rsquo;s father said anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; The soft sound of her sitting up was immediately followed by
another groan. &ldquo;Oh, my head. Wait&mdash;Zumu? Are you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Granna,&rdquo; Zumu said, relieved that she was all right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zumu, what happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so Zumu tried to explain: how he had followed Wumingu, then snuck
aboard Mister Fing&rsquo;s wagon, what Mister Fing had done with the
mushrooms, the talking cane, the attack by the crows&hellip;</p>
<p>He hadn&rsquo;t even reached the town when the schoolteacher cut him off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He tried to tell me the same kind of story,&rdquo; he said to Zumu&rsquo;s
father. &ldquo;Now, I think every child should have a bit of imagination, but
this&mdash;we&rsquo;ve used nearly fifteen cups of light looking for him, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; Zumu&rsquo;s father said. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll pay them back,
every one.&rdquo; He sighed and hugged his son again, but not quite as hard,
not quite as close. &ldquo;Zumu, this is wrong.&rdquo; He shook his son gently.
&ldquo;You <em>know</em> this is wrong. Spilling all of our light was bad, but
running away was much, much worse. We can always get more light, but
where would we ever find another you? And it was especially bad now,
when the baby is so close. Your mother was supposed to be at home, but
instead she has been out searching with everyone else.&rdquo; His father
hugged him again, but it was a different kind of hug, a &lsquo;trying not to
be angry&rsquo; hug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all true,&rdquo; Zumu said into his father&rsquo;s chest hopelessly.
He had thought he was going to be a hero. He had never imagined that
people wouldn&rsquo;t believe him. Not even his own father! If only the robot
hadn&rsquo;t run away! If only&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; a woman&rsquo;s voice called from outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in here,&rdquo; the schoolteacher called back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find him?&rdquo; the voice asked. It was one of the other women
from the village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He&rsquo;s all right. So is Granna Ipwepu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; the woman said. &ldquo;Because your wife needs you. She&rsquo;s having
the baby!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay with Granna Ipwepu,&rdquo; the woman from the village told
Zumu&rsquo;s father. &ldquo;You go help with the baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu and his father ran back through the woods as fast as they could.
When they reached the village, they saw a thin sheet of light leaking
out from beneath the door of the birthday house. A handful of people
stood in front of it, their feet casting long shadows. Zumu heard his
mother calling his father&rsquo;s name from inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You found him!&rdquo; one of the villagers said to Zumu&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was at Granna Ipwepu&rsquo;s,&rdquo; his father panted. &ldquo;How is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; an older woman said. &ldquo;Go in, go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu&rsquo;s father reached for the door, then hesitated. &ldquo;You stay here,&rdquo;
he ordered Zumu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I want to help!&rdquo; Zumu said plaintively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best way for you to help is to <em>stay here</em>,&rdquo; his father said
roughly.</p>
<p>He opened the door to the birthday house. Light spilled onto the faces
of the people outside. Everyone seemed to be frowning. &ldquo;&hellip;picked a
worse time&hellip;&rdquo; someone muttered. Zumu felt his ears burn. The door
closed with a <em>thump</em>, leaving them in darkness once again</p>
<p>Moments later, a heavy hand came down on Zumu&rsquo;s shoulder. It was the
schoolteacher. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s you and I have a word, shall we?&rdquo; he said. Zumu
opened his mouth to protest, but Mister Kalimu pulled him around the
side of the birthday house, away from the small crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you listen to me,&rdquo; the schoolteacher said once the walls of the
birthday house were between them and everyone else. &ldquo;You listen to me
with both ears. I do <em>not</em> want to hear you telling tales about chasing
after Mister Fing, or flying wagons, or any other such nonsense, do you
hear? You&rsquo;ll just unsettle people, and there&rsquo;s no point in doing that,
none at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No &lsquo;buts&rsquo;,&rdquo; the schoolteacher said roughly. &ldquo;Your mother and
father are going to need all the help they can get these next few
months. If I hear that you&rsquo;re telling tales, well, you know, they just
might not get that help. They just might have to try to take care of
that new baby in the dark. Do you understand me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not fair!&rdquo; Zumu protested. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t take our light
away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> any light to take away, remember? Because somebody
spilled it. The only light your family&rsquo;s going to see this week is
what&rsquo;s in the emergency barrel, and you won&rsquo;t get a drop of it unless
<em>I</em> say so. Now, am I going to hear any tales out of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu swallowed. &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; he said, in exactly the same voice that the
villagers used when they said, &ldquo;Thank you, Mister Fing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. Now stay out of trouble.&rdquo; With that, the schoolteacher turned
and walked away. Zumu stumbled back to the front of the birthday house
to wait.</p>
<p>An hour went by, or maybe two. In the darkness, there was no way to
tell. A few more people drifted into the village as word spread that
Zumu&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s time had come. None of them said anything to Zumu.</p>
<p>The noise from the birthday house grew louder. Zumu bowed his head.
<em>Please, let it be all right,</em> he begged. He felt exhausted. <em>Please.</em></p>
<p>Suddenly he heard a new sound, a thin, high-pitched cry. The light
inside the birthday house went dark. A minute later, the village&rsquo;s
midwife opened the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a boy,&rdquo; she told the crowd. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re calling him Iji.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahh&hellip; Iji&hellip;&rdquo; everyone sighed. A few people clapped their hands.</p>
<p>Zumu felt like a wrung-out rag. &ldquo;Can I see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; the midwife said. She guided Zumu to the birthday bed.
&ldquo;Zumu?&rdquo; his mother said weakly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; Zumu choked. He patted along the blanket until he felt
his mother&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Zumu,&rdquo; she whispered, squeezing him weakly. &ldquo;I was so afraid
we&rsquo;d lost you, but today we get you back, and a new little boy too.
Here, he&rsquo;s right here.&rdquo; She put her son&rsquo;s hand on the newborn baby&rsquo;s
head.</p>
<p>Zumu felt his little brother move. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so warm,&rdquo; he marveled,
wiping away the tears that were suddenly in his eyes.</p>
<p>Zumu&rsquo;s mother and the baby stayed in the birthday house that night
while Zumu and his father went home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better get to bed,&rdquo; Zumu&rsquo;s father said once they were inside.
&ldquo;We have a lot of mushrooms to pick tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why bother?&rdquo; Zumu muttered. &ldquo;Mister Fing just throws them away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment, Zumu&rsquo;s father said nothing. When he did speak, he spoke
very quietly. &ldquo;I hope you grow out of this soon, son. I&rsquo;d hate for you
to set a bad example for your little brother. Now go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next two days should have been the happiest of Zumu&rsquo;s life. His
mother came home with the baby, and Zumu got to hold him. He was as warm
as milk fresh out of a goat, and fell asleep peacefully in Zumu&rsquo;s arms
as if nothing was wrong with the world.</p>
<p>But the baby was the only good thing about those two days. Each morning,
Zumu forced a little breakfast down his throat and then followed his
father out into the woods to pick mushrooms. A few days before, he would
have enjoyed helping. It was grown-up work, and a chance to play word
games with his father.</p>
<p>Not now, though. He tramped through the forest with a safety string
around his waist leading back to the main path-string, thinking the
whole time about streetlights. He ran his hands over the stumps of
fallen trees looking for mushroom nests, all the while seeing Mister
Fing tossing them into the ditch beside the road. And as he gathered
fallen branches for the crackling, lightless fire that keep his mother
and Iji warm, he wondered where #20717 had gone.</p>
<p>School was worse. The first day, he walked into the village as if
nothing had changed and took his usual place on the floor in front of
Mister Kalimu.</p>
<p>Wumingu was waiting for him. &ldquo;Run away, run away,&rdquo; the bigger boy said
under his breath, too quietly for the teacher to hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did not,&rdquo; Zumu whispered back fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet there,&rdquo; the teacher said sternly. One of the girls in the class
giggled. A few minutes later, Wumingu thumped his arm, sneezing at the
same time so the teacher wouldn&rsquo;t hear it. Zumu just bum-shuffled out
of reach.</p>
<p>Then came recess. &ldquo;Zumu&rsquo;s a liar, Zumu&rsquo;s a liar,&rdquo; Wumingu said in a
sing-song voice. &ldquo;Hey, have you beaten up any dragons lately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave me alone,&rdquo; Zumu said angrily. &ldquo;I was only trying to help. I
was only trying to help <em>you</em>, remember? You were the one who didn&rsquo;t
get any light, and then you spilled all of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zumu&rsquo;s a liar, Zumu&rsquo;s a liar,&rdquo; Wumingu chanted. Zumu heard other
children whispering, just like the robots in town had whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am not!&rdquo; Zumu said hotly. &ldquo;Mister Fing didn&rsquo;t give you any light
because you called yourself &lsquo;mister&rsquo;, so I went to give you some of
mine, but you spilled it all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zumu&rsquo;s a liar, Zumu&rsquo;s a liar.&rdquo; A few other children had picked up
the chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am <em>not</em>!&rdquo; Zumu repeated furiously. &ldquo;And I didn&rsquo;t run away. We
don&rsquo;t have runaways in <em>my</em> family!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that, Wumingu threw himself at Zumu. Children shrieked, &ldquo;Fight!
Fight!&rdquo; The teacher was there in an instant, but by then, Zumu was
face-down in the dirt, thrashing vainly to shake the bigger boy off his
back.</p>
<p>When school was over, Zumu limped home. Somehow, his father had already
heard what had happened. It was bad enough that Zumu had run off, just
when his mother needed him to be a grown-up. But now this! What had
gotten into him?</p>
<p>Zumu tried to explain, of course. He hadn&rsquo;t started the fight, and
anyway, it wasn&rsquo;t fair. He had been trying to help Wumingu&mdash;that&rsquo;s
how everything started. But his father was no more interested than he
had been the day before.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how Zumu found himself sitting on an old stump in front of their
house, carefully picking apart an old canvas mushroom bag. The bag was
almost worn through in places, but thread was so tricky to make that
everyone re-used it whenever they could. It was delicate, tedious,
finicky, boring work&mdash;the perfect punishment, in a father&rsquo;s eyes,
for a boy who had let his imagination get the better of his honesty and
common sense.</p>
<p>He was staring into the darkness, feeling as sorry for himself as anyone
possibly could, when he heard footsteps on the path. &ldquo;Hello from the
house,&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello there.&rdquo; It was Granna Ipwepu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Granna,&rdquo; Zumu said heavily. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s your head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;ve taken harder knocks than that in my day. I&rsquo;ve
come to see the new baby. I missed his birthday, what with all the
excitement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Zumu said. She patted his shoulder with a bony hand and
knocked on the door.</p>
<p>Zumu stayed outside on his stump while Granna Ipwepu said all the things
that old women say to young women about new-born babies. Oh, he had such
soft skin&hellip; And such little ears, and such tiny fingers. Zumu wondered
if people had said the same things about him. He was sort of afraid that
they had.</p>
<p>Finally Granna Ipwepu said goodbye to Zumu&rsquo;s mother and came back
outside. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a fine little boy,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;Just like you
were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Zumu said, not knowing what else to say.</p>
<p>Granna Ipwepu chuckled, but then her tone turned serious. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t
you walk with me for a bit?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think we have some things to
talk about.&rdquo;</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Chapter 14</h2>
<p>Zumu&rsquo;s heart sank. He didn&rsquo;t think he could stomach another lecture.
&ldquo;All right, Granna,&rdquo; he sighed. He put the old bag in the
odds-and-ends box by the front door and followed her up the path.</p>
<p>Granna Ipwepu turned right at the main path-string, instead of left
toward the village. Zumu trudged along behind her in silence, wondering
where they were going. This path led into the forest, toward a stream
whose gravel banks had been picked clean of rubies long before Zumu was
born.</p>
<p>Zumu heard the stream burbling as they approached the end of the
path-string. &ldquo;Should be just here,&rdquo; Granna Ipwepu muttered. &ldquo;Ah!
There we are. Now, come sit with me, young man.&rdquo; Granna Ipwepu lowered
her creaky old bones onto a fallen log and patted the wood beside her.
Zumu stretched out until he felt the log with his foot, then let go of
the path-string and sat down next to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used to come here, oh, every week, at least,&rdquo; Granna Ipwepu
reminisced. &ldquo;Back when I was about your mother&rsquo;s age. My husband would
look after our children for an afternoon, and I&rsquo;d come out here, take
off my clothes, and go for a swim in the stream, all on my own.&rdquo; She
sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a &lsquo;swim&rsquo;?&rdquo; Zumu asked, not really wanting to think about
Granna Ipwepu taking off her clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Oh, swimming means playing in the water. Floating in it,
splashing around, holding your breath and diving like a fish&hellip; I
learned how before the light went away. It was almost my favorite thing
when I was little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that dangerous?&rdquo; Zumu asked. Like every other child in the
village, he had been taught to be very careful around water. You could
drown so easily or lose your bearings and come out on the wrong side of
the stream and never heard from again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s safe once you know how,&rdquo; Granna Ipwepu said. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t
suppose anyone swims any more, do they? Not in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu groped around by his feet for a couple of pebbles. &ldquo;I guess not.&rdquo;
Aiming for the gurgle of the stream, he tossed them into the water one
by one. <em>Ploop!</em> <em>Ploop!</em></p>
<p>The silence stretched. Zumu and Granna Ipwepu sat side by side, lost in
their own thoughts. Finally the old woman sighed again. &ldquo;A lot of
things were different, alright,&rdquo; she said, almost to herself. &ldquo;But
then everything changed. I&rsquo;ve told you the story, haven&rsquo;t I? About the
night the dragon came?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Granna,&rdquo; Zumu said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was getting ready for bed,&rdquo; she continued, as if she hadn&rsquo;t heard
him. &ldquo;I brushed my teeth and picked out a story for my father to read
to me, just like he always did. But instead, he told me about a strange
comet that he and the other scientists at the observatory had
discovered. Oh, a comet is like a ball of light in the sky, with a long
tail behind it. This one wasn&rsquo;t like other comets. It kept changing
direction, almost as if it was looking for something. I asked if it
might hit us. My father laughed and told me not to worry about it. Then
he tucked me in and went downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next thing I remember, there was a sound like thunder, except it
went on and on. I jumped out of bed and ran over to the window to see
the lightning. Oh, you don&rsquo;t know what lightning is either, do you? It
doesn&rsquo;t matter&hellip; Back then, I thought lightning was good luck, and I
made a wish whenever I saw some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t see any that night. What I saw&hellip;&rdquo; She paused. &ldquo;What
I saw was houses burning, and people running through the streets in
panic. And when I looked up, I saw the dragon. It had wings like a bat,
and a long neck like a snake. It swooped down on the town and spat fire
onto the houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father came pounding up the stairs. He told my mother and me to run
away. I didn&rsquo;t have time to get dressed&mdash;I just put on my rubber
boots and took my mother&rsquo;s hand and ran out in my pajamas. My father
went to help put out the fires. I never saw him again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Granna Ipwepu paused again. Zumu heard a faint squelch as she wiped her
eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he said awkwardly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; the old woman lied. &ldquo;It was a long time
ago.&rdquo; She patted his hand in the darkness. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not why I
wanted to talk to you today. I wanted to tell you a part of the story
that most people don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lowered her voice. &ldquo;Everyone was running here and there. Some
people were trying to find their families. Others were trying to save
old pictures from the fire, or a favorite quilt. It was all so
confused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow, my mother and I let go of each other. I don&rsquo;t really know
what happened. I think I might have bumped into someone, or maybe she
did&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. All I remember is standing there, all alone in my
pajamas and rubber boots, with people running and shouting all around
me, and the dragon shrieking and flaming overhead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I kept shouting, &lsquo;Mommy, Mommy,&rsquo; but with all the noise and
confusion, I couldn&rsquo;t even hear myself. I was so afraid of being
trampled or left behind. I was so afraid&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what, Granna?&rdquo; asked Zumu, his hearting beating fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I did the only thing I could think of: I ran back to our house.
It was probably the most dangerous place I could have gone, but I was
just little, and it was the only place I was sure my mother and father
would know to look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I never got there. Our house was next to a little park. I was
taking a short cut across it when I saw <em>them</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;them. Dozens of them.</p>
<p>At first I thought they were people from the town, but I was wrong. They
weren&rsquo;t really people at all. They were all completely bald, and their
skins were&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know. Shiny, almost, as if they polished
themselves instead of washing with soap and water like decent folks. And
they were all <em>smiling</em>.&rdquo; She gave a nervous little laugh. &ldquo;The whole
town was on fire, and I was lost, and they were all smiling. It was
horrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu heard her skinny shoulders shudder. &ldquo;So I turned around and ran
back the way I had come, straight into my mother&rsquo;s arms. I&rsquo;d been
right&mdash;she was coming to look for me at our house. She picked me up
and carried me out of town with everyone else. I remember looking back
over her shoulder at the fires, wondering what was going to happen to
us. That was the last time I ever saw my home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu opened his mouth to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; again, but Granna Ipwepu
wasn&rsquo;t finished. &ldquo;That was also the last time I saw one of those&hellip;
those&hellip; whatever they were. Until the other night, that is.&rdquo; Zumu
heard her shift her weight on the log beside him. &ldquo;There was one of
them with you when you knocked on my door, wasn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Granna,&rdquo; Zumu said. &ldquo;Number two oh seven one seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Number two oh seven one seven,&rdquo; Zumu repeated. &ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s its
name. They&rsquo;re robots&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been trying to tell
everyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they can&rsquo;t be. There were robots in the stories my father used to
read to me. They were made of metal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mister Fing calls them robots,&rdquo; Zumu said stubbornly. &ldquo;He uses
the rubies we dig up to make brains for them. I saw them, lots of them,
in town. They&rsquo;ve painted everything, and they sweep the leaves off the
streets. They even have the streetlights working.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know about streetlights?&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I <em>saw</em> them,&rdquo; Zumu said angrily. &ldquo;And the fountain in the
middle of town. <em>And</em> the ob&mdash;the ob-ser-va-tor-y.&rdquo; He sounded the
word out carefully. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where Mister Fing has his workshop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d dreamed the
bald man when I banged my head. He was really there, wasn&rsquo;t he? And you
really did go back to town with Mister Fing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, someone was listening to him! All Zumu could think to say was,
&ldquo;Yes, Granna. But no one believes me. My father and the schoolteacher
don&rsquo;t, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still not sure <em>I</em> believe you,&rdquo; she replied sharply.
&ldquo;But&hellip;streetlights. And the observatory&mdash;oh, I remember the
observatory. My father worked there, you know. Sometimes he took me with
him and let me look at the stars through the telescope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw the telescope,&rdquo; Zumu said. &ldquo;It was like a tree, only it was
held up by a thing like this.&rdquo; He brushed his fingers along the log to
find Granna Ipwepu&rsquo;s hand, then made a &lsquo;U&rsquo; with his own for her to
feel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They used that to tilt it up and
down, and turn it, so that they could aim it at things far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Zumu asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they could see them better. It had enormous pieces of glass on each
end, a big one at the top and a smaller one at the bottom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like lenses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, how would you know about&hellip;? Yes, they were lenses. My father
said they concentrated the light, so that the scientists could see
things that were very faint, or very far away.&rdquo; The old woman paused.
When she spoke, her voice was wistful. &ldquo;He used to ride his bicycle up
the hill to work every morning. I had a little bicycle of my own. I
wanted so much to learn how to ride it so that I could go with him. But
I never got to. I never went on a ride with my father. There were so
many things that none of us got to do&hellip; That we&rsquo;ll never do, as long
as we&rsquo;re stuck here in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we go back?&rdquo; Zumu asked tentatively. &ldquo;There probably
aren&rsquo;t really that many robots. And I didn&rsquo;t see the dragon at all. It
might have left. If you could make everyone believe that I really was
there, maybe we could&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; she snorted. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t listen to an addled old woman who
just bumped her head, any more than they&rsquo;ll listen to a little fibber
who ran off because he was mad that his mother was having a baby. I
know, you didn&rsquo;t really, but that&rsquo;s what everyone thinks. That&rsquo;s what
our noble schoolteacher has them all believing, anyway, pompous muck
that he is.&rdquo; She snorted.</p>
<p>They sat together in the darkness, the young boy and the old woman, lost
in despair. The stream burbled past them on its way down the mountain,
not knowing light from darkness, and not caring, either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re not going to change the world today,&rdquo; Granna Ipwepu
finally said. She <em>oophed</em> as she got up from the log. &ldquo;So I suppose we
should both get back to our chores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Granna,&rdquo; Zumu said obediently. She was right. He should go and
finish his chores. But once they were done, he had an idea&hellip;</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Chapter 15</h2>
<p>The next day, when lessons were over, the children joined hands to file
out of the classroom without bumping into each other.</p>
<p>But not Zumu. He stepped back and flattened himself against the wall,
listening to the children&rsquo;s voices fade as they scattered along the
path-strings to their homes and chores. The only sound left was the
schoolteacher tidying up his desk.</p>
<p>This was the part that had worried Zumu the most. If Mister Kalimu used
even a single drop of light, he would be sure to see Zumu. If that
happened, Zumu would have to bluff. &ldquo;I wanted to ask you some questions
about the lesson,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Wumingu is still bullying me, but I don&rsquo;t
want to complain in front of everyone else, because that will just make
it worse.&rdquo; The second one wouldn&rsquo;t even be a lie&hellip;</p>
<p>But everyone knew how stingy the schoolteacher was. Every family in the
village gave him a few drops of light each week, but he hardly ever used
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll spend their lives in the dark,&rdquo; he told parents, comforting
or stern depending on his mood. &ldquo;If I splash light all over the place,
it&rsquo;ll just take them longer to get used to the idea.&rdquo; So the villagers
told themselves that Mister Kalimu knew best, and that after all, it was
his business what he did with his light.</p>
<p>But still, everyone wondered. Was he saving it up for someone special?
Or were the stories some of the children whispered true&mdash;did he drink
it, or bathe in it, to give himself magic powers?</p>
<p>None of them ever imagined that the light they gave him lay in bottle
after bottle on the shelves in his house, the only building in the
village other than the school to have a lock on its door. No one knew
how often Mister Kalimu woke up shivering and afraid in the darkness, or
that the only way he could get back to sleep was to count those bottles
one by one, to reassure himself that he would always have enough. Almost
enough. Almost&hellip;</p>
<p>Zumu counted two hundred and twenty-nine heartbeats in his head as
Mister Kalimu tidied his desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; the schoolteacher finally said to no one, &ldquo;Time to go
home.&rdquo; He crossed the floor a mere arm&rsquo;s length from Zumu. The door
opened with a slight squeak. (No door in the village was perfectly
quiet. People said, &ldquo;Oh, I really should put just a little more oil on
those hinges,&rdquo; but no one ever did, because no one wanted children
sneaking up and yelling &ldquo;boo!&rdquo;) The key clicked faintly in the lock,
<em>snick snack</em>. Zumu was locked in.</p>
<p>Which was exactly his plan. He had tossed and turned all night, trying
to come up with a better one, but it always came down to the same thing:
where could he get enough light? Not from his mother and father&mdash;they
only had a few drops, which they needed to help the baby learn how to
see. Not from Granna Ipwepu&mdash;even if she did believe him, she would
say it was too dangerous. And everyone else thought he was a liar.</p>
<p>That left only the emergency barrel in the village square, or the bottle
that Mister Kalimu kept for the school. The barrel was for fighting
fires and finding missing children. Zumu couldn&rsquo;t take light from
it&mdash;he just couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So there he stood, hiding in the school when everyone else had gone
home, about to become the worst thing in the world: a light thief.</p>
<p><em>But I&rsquo;m doing it to help everyone,</em> he told himself for the thousandth
time. He couldn&rsquo;t live in darkness for the rest of his life, knowing
what he knew. He couldn&rsquo;t let everyone else live that way either. At
the age of twelve, he had discovered that knowledge could be as powerful
as gravity. Just knowing something could tug at you until you had no
choice but to move.</p>
<p>Three steps took him to Mister Kalimu&rsquo;s desk. He picked up the bottle
of light . In its place he left the note that he had secretly pricked
out during class. <em>I will bring it back. Zumu.</em></p>
<p>He closed the door carefully behind him so that bats couldn&rsquo;t get in.
Someone was singing softly in the distance; on the other side of the
village, someone else was having a quiet argument. Zumu shook his head
and hurried away.</p>
<p>He followed the main path-string through the village to the road that
led down the mountain. When he reached the string&rsquo;s end he felt around
until his fingers found a long, skinny fern he could use to scatter
light over a wider area. He pulled it out and patted the ground again
until he found a rock as big as his two fists put together. Setting it
down carefully in one of the ruts in the road, he stood up, took a deep
breath, and set off.</p>
<p>Once again, he used to rut to</p>
<p>guide himself past the first bend in the road. There, he slowed down,
unsure. Was this where he had jumped onto Mister Fing&rsquo;s wagon? Or was
it further ahead? Further ahead, he decided&mdash;the wagon had been on
flat ground for at least a couple of minutes before Mister Fing stopped.</p>
<p>Trudge, trudge, trudge&hellip; His nose twitched at the smell of rot. Zumu
halted and tucked his fern under his arm, then held the bottle of light
up to his ear and shook it. From the way it gurgled, he guessed it was
about half full. He pulled the stopper out and poured a couple of drops
very carefully onto the fern.</p>
<p>As quickly as he could, he put the stopper back in the bottle and waved
the fern to scatter the light all around him. There they were! Zumu
couldn&rsquo;t believe his luck. The mushrooms were in the ditch right beside
him!</p>
<p>Then he looked a little more closely. These mushrooms were
rotten&mdash;they must have been there for weeks. He poured more light on
his fern and waved it in the air again. There was another pile further
down the road, and another one beyond that. Mister Fing must have been
dumping his sack here for years.</p>
<p>Zumu shook his head. It didn&rsquo;t matter. Proof was proof. He pulled the
old canvas bag he had been mending out of his belt and started filling
it.</p>
<p>The mushrooms were slimy. Hard-shelled beetles scuttled away as he
picked them up, and the smell was enough to make him gag, but he kept at
it grimly until his sack was full.</p>
<p>The mushrooms squelched in the bag as he retraced his steps. Now he had
proof. Now everyone would <em>have</em> to believe him.</p>
<p>He had just reached the bend in the road again when a twig snapped in
the forest. He froze, listening, but couldn&rsquo;t hear anything except the
soft whisper of the wind through the pines. No, wait! That sounded like
a branch being pushed out of someone&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>Zumu swallowed a dry mouthful of nothing. No one from the village had
any reason to come this way, unless&mdash;no, they couldn&rsquo;t be looking
for him yet. <em>Not that they would anyway,</em> he thought sourly. <em>Not
twice</em>.</p>
<p>Another twig snapped. Zumu didn&rsquo;t move. He couldn&rsquo;t run without light,
but if he used even a drop, whatever was out there would see him.</p>
<p>Slowly, very slowly, Zumu raised his right foot and set it down a few
inches further up the road. He raised his left foot, froze with it in
mid-air at the sound of another branch being pushed aside, then finished
the step just as carefully as the first. Another, another&hellip; He
stopped. It would take him forever to get back to the village at this
rate, and sooner or later, no matter how careful he was, he&rsquo;d make a
noise. All he could do was wait for whoever&mdash;or whatever&mdash;it was
to pass him in the darkness.</p>
<p>Rustle&hellip; snap&hellip; rustle&hellip; The sounds in the forest slowly grew
fainter. Whatever it was, it was moving farther away. Zumu stood like a
statue until he could hear it no longer, then stood for a few minutes
more. Only then did he let himself take a deep breath. He shook his
head. Life had been easier when it was boring.</p>
<p>Around the bend, up the hill&hellip; The closer he got to the village, the
faster he walked. Evil-smelling slime from the rotten mushrooms had
soaked through the canvas bag into his shirt, making an unpleasant damp
patch on his skin. Suddenly his toes bumped into the rock he had set in
the rut an hour before. He took another step forward, waving his arms
slowly from side to side. There&mdash;that must be the tree the
path-string was tied to.</p>
<p>He reached out cautiously. Yes, there it was. He grinned. He was home
free. He reached out to the find the next path-string&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;and yelped in terror as a heavy hand came down on his shoulder.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>
<p>&ldquo;And where do you think <em>you&rsquo;re</em> going?&rdquo; It was Mister Kalimu. He
must have been waiting by the path-string.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just&mdash;I went to get some of the mushrooms Mister Fing dumped
out in the ditch,&rdquo; Zumu said. &ldquo;So that everyone would believe me.&rdquo; He
held out his sack, even though he knew the teacher couldn&rsquo;t see it in
the dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you <em>still</em> telling that story?&rdquo; Mister Kalimu said, his voice
hard. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;ve caused enough trouble? Don&rsquo;t you think
you&rsquo;ve shamed your mother and father enough? You pick a fight, spill
your family&rsquo;s light, run away&mdash;when your mother is having a baby, no
less&mdash;and then nearly split Granna Ipwepu&rsquo;s head open. And if that
weren&rsquo;t enough, you keep telling these ridiculous stories, even after I
told you not to! Zumu, everyone wants more light. No one likes having to
work as hard as we do for the little we get. But we should be grateful
for it, not make up fairy tales and play wish-it-was games! And we
<em>certainly</em> shouldn&rsquo;t go around stealing other people&rsquo;s light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you&rsquo;re the first child to try to hide in the school
after class?&rdquo; Mister Kalimu asked. &ldquo;Do you? Well, you&rsquo;re not. Plenty
of other children have thought that they could wait until I was gone,
then take a look at the answers to the arithmetic homework or put a
stink-frog in my desk drawer. But you are the first&mdash;the very
first&mdash;who ever took the school&rsquo;s light. Now, give it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it back, or I won&rsquo;t just tell your father. I&rsquo;ll tell the whole
village. Now, <em>give it back</em>.&rdquo; The schoolteacher snapped his fingers.</p>
<p>With a sick feeling in the pit of his stomach, Zumu handed the bottle to
Mister Kalimu. &ldquo;But will you at least take a look at what I found?&rdquo; he
pleaded hopelessly. He shook the bag of mushrooms so that the
schoolteacher could hear where it was.</p>
<p>The schoolteacher snatched the bag out of his hands. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <em>care</em>
what you found!&rdquo; the schoolteacher barked. &ldquo;Do you understand me? We
have all the light we need. What we <em>don&rsquo;t</em> need is someone stirring up
trouble!&rdquo; He whirled the sack around and threw it into the darkness. It
hit the ground with a soggy <em>plomph</em> somewhere in the distance.</p>
<p>Zumu heard the schoolteacher&rsquo;s deep, angry breathing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m warning
you, Zumu. I will <em>not</em> have you stirring everyone up with your crazy
stories. And if I ever think, even for a moment, that you really have
done something as log-headed as chasing after Mister Fing, I will drag
you out into the darkness myself and tie you to a tree and whistle until
the snarly-dogs come for you. Now <em>go home</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, he walked away. The path-string twitched in Zumu&rsquo;s fingers
until the teacher reached the next tree. After his footsteps died away
in the distance, there was no sound left except the wind in the pines,
and the lonely <em>chirrup</em> of a blind cricket.</p>
<p>Zumu had failed. It wouldn&rsquo;t matter what he showed people now. If the
teacher told them he had taken the school&rsquo;s light, their ears and minds
would close like doors slammed to keep out the rain.</p>
<p>He smacked the tree beside him in frustration</p>
<p>, then kicked it. He was angrier than he had ever been. It just wasn&rsquo;t
fair! &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&hellip; not&hellip; fair!&rdquo; he said aloud, kicking the tree
with each word.</p>
<p>As if in reply, something went <em>plomph</em> at Zumu&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>Zumu prodded it gingerly with his toe. It was his sack of mushrooms.
Someone had just thrown his sack of mushrooms back to him.</p>
<p>He picked it up and tossed it into the darkness once again. <em>Plomph.</em>
One heartbeat, two, three&hellip; <em>Plomph,</em> right back at his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this a game?&rdquo; a familiar voice asked out of the darkness. &ldquo;Are we
having fun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Number two oh seven one seven?&rdquo; Zumu gasped. &ldquo;Is that you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes it is,&rdquo; the robot&rsquo;s voice replied. &ldquo;At least, I think it is.
I&rsquo;m not really sure any longer. I don&rsquo;t seem to be the same &lsquo;me&rsquo;
that I was a couple of days ago. Is it your turn now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My turn? Never mind about that&mdash;where have you been? Why did you
run off like that?&rdquo; Zumu could hear the anger in his own voice.
&ldquo;Everyone would have believed me if they&rsquo;d seen you. Why did you run
away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence, and then, &ldquo;I was scared,&rdquo; the robot confessed. &ldquo;I had never
been scared before. I guess my old brain wasn&rsquo;t smart enough for it.
But then the Granna Ipwepu monster started throwing stones at me. I
didn&rsquo;t know it was a game. I didn&rsquo;t know what games were, really,
until I heard your friends playing some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granna Ipwepu wasn&rsquo;t playing a game,&rdquo; Zumu said glumly. &ldquo;She was
just as scared of you as you were of her. Maybe even more scared, I bet.
But hey, what do you mean, you heard us playing games? Have you been
spying on us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does &lsquo;spying&rsquo; mean?&rdquo; the robot asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sitting really quietly in the dark and listening to people when they
don&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;re there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then yes, I have been spying on you. I have been spying on
everyone. I have learned so many new things! My brain is practically
buzzing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;ve learned how to get people to believe you&rsquo;re
telling the truth for a change, have you?&rdquo; Zumu asked glumly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the robot said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never tried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, would you like to? You could come back with me and let everyone
see you. Then they&rsquo;d <em>have</em> to believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; the robot said doubtfully. &ldquo;I think they would
just throw stones at me like the Granna Ipwepu monster did. Especially
if that loud man you were just talking to tells them to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu sighed dejectedly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re probably right. Anyway, you shouldn&rsquo;t
call Granna Ipwepu a monster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she threw stones,&rdquo; the robot replied reasonably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just because she was scared!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I was scared too, but I didn&rsquo;t throw anything. Oh, I just had a
thought, about throwing. What if you showed them some of the other
things Mister Fing has thrown away? Would they believe you then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean more mushrooms? I doubt it,&rdquo; Zumu said sourly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I mean the other things. I still have the other can of light that
we brought. And I found some things in the forest when I was looking for
a place to think. Would you like to see them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of things?&rdquo; Zumu asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo; Heavy footsteps crunched on the ground.
Zumu shrank back instinctively, but the robot reached out in the dark
and found his arm. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, we won&rsquo;t get lost. Once I have been
somewhere, I always remember the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu put his hand on the robot&rsquo;s shoulder. It led him down the side of
the mountain, through the trees, around a fallen tree, and over a big
half-buried rock. Finally it stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s right here,&rdquo; the robot said. &ldquo;Would you like some light?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, please,&rdquo; Zumu said. He heard the robot unscrew the cap on the
can of light (how could he have forgotten about that? he wondered
briefly). The robot shook some into the air.</p>
<p>There on the ground were an old canvas pack, some rusty cans and broken
bottles, and a skeleton, complete with a skull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip;&rdquo; Zumu gasped. He knelt down, feeling around very carefully
until his hand found one of the cans. &ldquo;Can I have some more light?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The robot splashed some in the air. Zumu looked at the rain-faded label
on the can. It wasn&rsquo;t like anything he had ever seen before. He
swallowed. Was it from&hellip; Was it from <em>outside</em> the darkness?</p>
<p>But something else had reflected the light as well.</p>
<p>Zumu patted the ground to find it. It was square and heavy, made of
metal, with a curlicue pattern embossed on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like more light?&rdquo; #20717 asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No thanks,&rdquo; Zumu said quietly. &ldquo;This is Wumingu&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s belt
buckle. I remember it&mdash;it came from the town. Wumingu was supposed to
get it one day, but then his father went into the woods and never came
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Mister Fing throw him away?&rdquo; the robot asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. I think he just fell, or something.&rdquo; Zumu
shivered. He could have slipped on a loose stone and banged his head or
broken his leg and never found his way back to a path-string. It could
have happened so easily. It could just as easily have happened to Zumu.</p>
<p>Zumu turned the belt buckle over in his hand. &ldquo;I should give it to
Wumingu,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But even then, no one would believe me. Not unless
you came with me. And even then&hellip;&rdquo; Zumu sighed. &ldquo;What could we do?
Really? The town is so far away, and you robots are all so strong&hellip;
Even if we did try, all of us, the robots would just make us go away
again. It&rsquo;s hopeless&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wind sighed, and Zumu sighed with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just had an idea,&rdquo; the robot said slowly. &ldquo;What if <em>you</em> came back
to town with <em>me</em>? What if we convinced the other robots that they
don&rsquo;t have to do what Mister Fing says?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would you do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the robot replied, it was so quiet that Zumu had a hard time
hearing it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve started remembering things. We were all crowded
together in the dark, waiting, for a long, long time. And then we were
here. We were supposed to help it build a nest&mdash;that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re
for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It? What&rsquo;s &lsquo;it&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He heard the robot shake its head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember yet. It&rsquo;s all
very confusing. But Mister Fing did something very bad. He&rsquo;s not
supposed to be telling everyone what to do. I have to tell the others
that.&rdquo; It paused. &ldquo;Will you help me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu stood in the dark beside the skeleton of Wumingu&rsquo;s father with the
heavy silver belt buckle in his hand. It was supposed to have been
Wumingu&rsquo;s&hellip; And Granna Ipwepu never got to go on a bike ride with her
father&hellip; He took a deep breath. Sometimes knowledge was as strong as
gravity&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Zumu said. &ldquo;But this time, I&rsquo;m going to tell Granna
Ipwepu where I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Chapter 17</h2>
<p>Granna Ipwepu wasn&rsquo;t home, so Zumu left her a note. <em>Dear Granna</em>, it
said, <em>The robot came back. We are going to town to get the other robots
to help us.</em> He carefully poked a few more holes to spell out, <em>Love,
Zumu</em>, then hung the leaf from the path-string by her front door.</p>
<p>One last chore remained. Two round, two square, one triangle&mdash;he
hadn&rsquo;t been this way in a long time. &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; he said when he reached
the bent pine he remembered from visits long ago. &ldquo;Wumingu? Are you
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zumu?&rdquo; A chair creaked as he stood up. &ldquo;What are <em>you</em> doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I brought you something,&rdquo; he said. He followed the last stretch of
path-string to his front door. &ldquo;Is your mother home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s down at the stream washing clothes,&rdquo; Wumingu said warily.
&ldquo;Why? Do you think <em>she&rsquo;s</em> going to listen to your stupid stories?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come here to fight,&rdquo; Zumu said. &ldquo;I came here to apologize.
About&mdash;about what I said about your father. Here.&rdquo; He slid his hand
forward along the path-string until he felt the other boy&rsquo;s fingers.
Wumingu jerked his hand away as if he&rsquo;d been stung. &ldquo;Here, take it,&rdquo;
Zumu repeated.</p>
<p>Warily, Wumingu brushed his fingertips against Zumu&rsquo;s. Zumu put the
belt buckle in Wumingu&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; Wumingu scoffed. &ldquo;Part of that bottle you dropped?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Zumu was tempted to snatch it back and throw it into the
forest. Instead, he shook his head. &ldquo;It was your father&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said
simply. &ldquo;Two oh seven one seven found him in the woods. I&rsquo;m really
sorry. He must have fallen on his way back to the village. But he had
stuff in his pack, stuff from somewhere else, so maybe&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p><em>Crack!</em> Wumingu&rsquo;s punch took Zumu completely by surprise. He yelped,
stumbled back a step and fell to the ground. &ldquo;Ow!&rdquo; He sat up and
rubbed his jaw. &ldquo;What did you do that for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used to like your stupid stories,&rdquo; Wumingu said coldly. &ldquo;I knew
they weren&rsquo;t true, but at least they were funny. But don&rsquo;t you ever,
<em>ever</em> tell stories about my father. Do you hear me? Not to anyone, and
<em>especially</em> not to my mother. Or I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he believes you,&rdquo; #20717 said calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said that?&rdquo; Wumingu demanded sharply.</p>
<p>#20717 didn&rsquo;t answer. Instead, it flicked a fingernail of light from
the can it was carrying into the air.</p>
<p>Zumu struggled to his feet, feeling bitter satisfaction at the stunned
look on Wumingu&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a robot,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;From the town. It
used to work for Mister Fing, but now it&rsquo;s my friend. Oh, and that <em>is</em>
your father&rsquo;s belt buckle. Go ahead, take a look. No one&rsquo;s going to
hit <em>you</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wumingu&rsquo;s eyes moved from #20717&rsquo;s face to Zumu&rsquo;s and down to what
he was still holding in her hand. He turned it over with a gulp.
&ldquo;Daddy?&rdquo; he whispered, as the light faded to black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he believes you now,&rdquo; #20717 whispered loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; Zumu told it sharply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry, Wumingu. It&rsquo;ll be
all right. I promise it&rsquo;ll be all right. Two oh seven one seven and I
are going to <em>make</em> it all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wumingu sniffled. &ldquo;How can you make this all right?&rdquo; he asked
wretchedly. &ldquo;How can <em>anyone</em> make this right? My mother&rsquo;s going
to&mdash;she still says sometimes that we shouldn&rsquo;t stop hoping. That he
might still&hellip;&rdquo; Finally, he broke down and cried.</p>
<p>Zumu swallowed the lump in his throat. &ldquo;Listen. I have to go now. I
left a note for Granna. If&hellip; If I don&rsquo;t come back, she&rsquo;ll know what
happened. All right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the dark, Zumu couldn&rsquo;t tell how if Wumingu was still listening, or
how much he had understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it time to go?&rdquo; #20717 asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Zumu said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again, Zumu rode on the robot&rsquo;s shoulders as it jogged through the
darkness at the same steady pace as before. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to use any
light,&rdquo; it told Zumu. &ldquo;I remember the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Zumu said, still thinking about Wumingu&rsquo;s father. &ldquo;Once
you have seen it, you never forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Crunch crunch crunch whomph whomph whomph</em>&hellip; The robot&rsquo;s feet echoed
on the bridge once more. The road climbed the mountainside, twisting
this way and that. Zumu&rsquo;s arms started to ache again, but he ignored
them. He was scared, but he tried to ignore that too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever get tired?&rdquo; Zumu asked. It was the first time he had
spoken in an hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the robot said wistfully. &ldquo;I wish I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because if I got tired, I might sleep, and if I slept, I might find
out what dreams are like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They ran on in silence for a few more moments. &ldquo;Do you know what I
dream about?&rdquo; Zumu asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Color,&rdquo; Zumu told it. &ldquo;I dream about everything being different
colors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything <em>is</em> different colors, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; the robot asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what if you don&rsquo;t have any light to see them? Are they still
there?&rdquo; They fell back into silence.</p>
<p><em>Crunch crunch crunch</em> went the robot&rsquo;s feet, then all of a sudden
something flickered overhead: red, orange, red, orange, yellow&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Zumu said. &ldquo;Go back! Turn around!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The robot stopped so quickly that Zumu went <em>whoof</em>. It ran backward for
a few steps, then spun around and raced back down the hill. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
wrong?&rdquo; it asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The streetlights,&rdquo; Zumu said. &ldquo;If Mister Fing sees them come on,
he&rsquo;ll know someone is coming.&rdquo; He twisted around to look back. Yellow,
orange, red, orange, red&hellip; darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, you can let me down now. Ow! Ow, oh, oh&hellip;&rdquo; Zumu&rsquo;s legs
buckled as #20717 released him. He sat on the road and rubbed them to
get the blood flowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there are lights everywhere,&rdquo; #20717 said. &ldquo;Even in the parks.
We can&rsquo;t get to the other robots without them coming on. And even if we
could&hellip;&rdquo; He hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Zumu asked. &ldquo;Even if we could, then what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if we could, it would be wrong,&rdquo; #20717 continued slowly. &ldquo;We
are here to tell them the truth. We shouldn&rsquo;t sneak around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if we don&rsquo;t, Mister Fing will catch us, or tell them to catch us
for him. Or just tell them not to believe whatever we say. Then what
will we&mdash;what was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu scrambled to his feet. Something fluttered over his head. He held
his breath. There it was again. No, there <em>they</em> were again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s the crows,&rdquo; he whispered to the robot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crows?&rdquo; the robot whispered back. &ldquo;Oh, the spies Mister Fing warned
us about. We&rsquo;re supposed to catch them whenever we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re supposed to catch them too,&rdquo; Zumu whispered back. &ldquo;Then he
dunks them in light to&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know why, exactly, but they sure
don&rsquo;t like it. Hey, maybe that means they&rsquo;re on our side! Quick, give
me the light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The robot passed him the can. Zumu unscrewed the cap, poured a few drops
into it, and held it up.</p>
<p>It was the crows, all right. The whole flock was perched in the branches
of the trees around them. Zumu shivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this,&rdquo; the robot whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it either,&rdquo; Zumu whispered back. He remembered their
sharp claws digging into his arms and shoulders as they lifted him off
the falling wagon. He took a deep breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said loudly. &ldquo;What are we supposed to do now?&rdquo; The crows
sat on their branches silently, watching the boy and the robot with
beady black eyes.</p>
<p>The light faded away. The robot put its hand on Zumu&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know what they want, but I&rsquo;m not waiting to find out. Lights or
no lights, it&rsquo;s time.&rdquo; Its voice sounded stronger than it had before.</p>
<p>The two of them walked side by side, the robot guiding the boy. When the
first streetlight came on, the crows took wing. They flew ahead and
settled back into the trees, waited for Zumu and #20717 to pass, then
flew past them again. The streetlights brightened, steadied, and faded
one after another</p>
<p>Soon they saw another robot. Zumu hesitated when he spotted the bald
figure raking leaves, but #20717 squeezed his shoulder. &ldquo;Everything
will be all right,&rdquo; it said calmly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The robot straightened up as they approached. Instead of the bright
smile that would have greeted Mister Fing, it wore no expression at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a meeting in the square,&rdquo; #20717 told it. &ldquo;Everyone should
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mister Fing didn&rsquo;t tell me about any meeting,&rdquo; the robot said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not Mister Fing&rsquo;s meeting,&rdquo; #20717 replied calmly. &ldquo;Now come
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The robot looked from #20717 to Zumu, then up at the crows in the
branches above them. &ldquo;What about them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of them,&rdquo; #20717 said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of anything
any more. And you shouldn&rsquo;t be either.&rdquo; It walked away, not looking
back to see if the other robot was following. Zumu willed himself not to
look back either.</p>
<p>They passed more robots along the way. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a meeting in the
square,&rdquo; #20717 told them all. &ldquo;Everyone should come.&rdquo; The crowd
behind them grew bigger with every step while overhead, the crows
circled, watching.</p>
<p>Dozens of robots had gathered by the time they reached the square.
#20717 stepped up onto the stone lip of the pool around the central
fountain. Zumu stood to one side, looking at the sea of emotionless
faces surrounding them. No one seemed to notice him. All eyes were on
#20717. And for once, none of the robots were smiling.</p>
<p>#20717 raised its arms. &ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; it said. It didn&rsquo;t speak loudly,
but its voice carried clearly across the square. &ldquo;I have gone where
none of us has gone before. I have been into the darkness. There are no
monsters out there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the robots spoke up. &ldquo;How can that be? Mister Fing told us there
were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know he did,&rdquo; #20717 said. &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t meet any. Instead, I
met an old woman who was frightened of me because of something we did
here many years ago. Something we don&rsquo;t remember because we the brains
Mister Fing gives us aren&rsquo;t good enough to remember that far back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>#20717 gestured at Zumu. &ldquo;But thanks to this brave young boy, I now
have the best brain I could ever want. My brain is so clear that I can
see that Mister Fing has lied to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shocked murmur ran around the crowd of robots. Another robot spoke up.
&ldquo;But that can&rsquo;t be right. Mister Fing is our friend. He gives us our
jobs. He fixes us when we break. He wouldn&rsquo;t lie to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he has,&rdquo; #20717 told them. &ldquo;He has. There are no monsters. And
do you know what else? We don&rsquo;t have to do what Mister Fing says! We
can do what <em>we</em> want to do. We can choose our own jobs. No, wait,
listen to me! Listen to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was too late. As soon as #20717 said, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to do what
Mister Fing says,&rdquo; the robots&rsquo; murmuring turned angry. Their voices
grew louder and louder, until Zumu could hear that they weren&rsquo;t saying
any real words. &ldquo;Bur, bur, bur,&rdquo; they said, over and over again.
&ldquo;Bur, bur, burrrrrroken! Broken!&rdquo; Suddenly they were all chanting it
together: &ldquo;Broken! Broken!&rdquo;</p>
<p>#20717 was still trying to speak as the mob of robots pressed forward.
Zumu screamed. He was going to be trampled! He stumbled back against the
fountain, stepping clumsily over the fountain&rsquo;s edge to splash into the
water.</p>
<p>Just as he did so, the mob grabbed #20717. &ldquo;Listen to me!&rdquo; it said as
they pulled it down. &ldquo;Listen to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu heard a horrible sound, like metal scraping on metal, and then
there was silence&mdash;complete, utter silence. Something went <em>clank</em>.
The mob&rsquo;s chanting stopped as suddenly as it had started. The robots
turned and walked away, back to whatever jobs they had been doing before
#20717 had interrupted them.</p>
<p>Pieces of #20717 were scattered all over&mdash;an arm here, a foot there.
Weeping, Zumu stepped out of the pool and picked up #20717&rsquo;s head. The
little hatch in its forehead was open. Zumu looked around wildly. Had
they&mdash;no, there it was. He knelt down and picked up the beautiful
ruby that had given the robot so many new thoughts. It was cracked and
chipped now. Hands shaking, he put it back in #20717&rsquo;s head and closed
the hatch.</p>
<p>Nothing happened. &ldquo;Oh, please,&rdquo; Zumu begged. &ldquo;Please, please,
please&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>#20717&rsquo;s eyelids fluttered. Its mouth jerked opened, clicked shut,
then opened again. &ldquo;You&hellip; are&hellip; leaking&hellip;&rdquo; it rasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please be all right,&rdquo; Zumu begged it. &ldquo;Please, you have to be all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Broken&hellip;&rdquo; the robot said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No you&rsquo;re not!&rdquo; Zumu told it. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only one who isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Broken&hellip; now&hellip;&rdquo; the robot said. &ldquo;You&hellip; show&hellip; them&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Zumu cried. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show&hellip; them&hellip;&rdquo; the robot rasped. &ldquo;Friend&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu shook the head gently. &ldquo;Two oh seven one seven? Two oh seven one
seven! Oh, no&hellip;&rdquo; He cradled the robot&rsquo;s head in his arms and cried.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18</h2>
<p>Zumu&rsquo;s tears eventually stopped, as tears always do, but he didn&rsquo;t get
up. He just sat on the ground with #20717&rsquo;s head in his lap.</p>
<p>A crow landed in front of him. It cocked its head to one side, then
spread its wings and flew away. Zumu wiped his nose on his sleeve.
Another crow landed, or maybe it was the same one. It hopped toward Zumu
and cawed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; Zumu told it. The crow spread its wings for balance, hopped
closer, and pecked at his leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ow!&rdquo; Zumu tried to swat the crow, but it fluttered away out of reach.</p>
<p>Something sharp poked Zumu in the small of his back. He twisted around
and swatted at another crow. Half a dozen were on the ground around him
now, a dozen, more, poking him with their sharp little beaks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, all right!&rdquo; Zumu said. He stood up wearily and set
#20717&rsquo;s head down carefully by the fountain. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re having
a nice dream,&rdquo; Zumu whispered.</p>
<p>He turned and glared at the crows. &ldquo;Well, what are you waiting for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He followed them out of town toward the observatory. The road was steep,
and Zumu was exhausted, but he pushed himself onward, step after step.
He used the last of the light from the spare can to find his way.
#20717 was right: it was time to finish this once and for all.</p>
<p>When he saw the glow from the storage tanks ahead, Zumu left the road
and crept quietly through the forest. There they were, with their tangle
of pipes. And there were the snarly-dogs, on guard instead of snoring.
They paced back and forth, snuffling at the ground and sniffing at the
air, ears up and lips curled back from their ugly fangs.</p>
<p>Zumu watched them for a minute, then looked up at the nearest crow.
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he told it. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what I want you to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few moments later, a lone black bird swooped down out of the darkness
to peck at a snarly-dog&rsquo;s head. The snarly-dog leapt into the air and
snapped its jaws, but the crow had already wheeled out of reach. Another
crow swooped down on another snarly-dog, then another.</p>
<p>Soon the air was swirling with crows. The snarly-dogs jumped at them,
but the birds were too quick. Yelping with frustration, the snarly-dogs
didn&rsquo;t notice that they were slowly being led away from the
observatory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; Zumu snapped. The crows on his arms and shoulders flapped their
wings. Up, up, up they lifted him, up to the tops of the trees, up so
high that the snarly-dogs wouldn&rsquo;t notice them.</p>
<p>The crows carried him to the observatory&rsquo;s round roof. Zumu&rsquo;s sandals
brushed against it. &ldquo;Gently!&rdquo; he hissed. The crows lowered him until
he felt the roof under his feet. There was a lip where it met the
building&rsquo;s walls. He turned his feet sideways and flattened himself
against the dome to wait.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the door banged open just a few moments later. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
going on here?&rdquo; Mister Fing bellowed. &ldquo;You stupid brutes! What are you
doing?&rdquo; He lumbered across the gravel.</p>
<p>Zumu dropped to the ground and ducked into the observatory. His feet
clattered across the walkway and down the ladder to the workshop floor.
&ldquo;Ha! I knew you&rsquo;d come back!&rdquo; the crow&rsquo;s head squawked. &ldquo;Half the
light was too good an offer to pass up after all, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind that,&rdquo; Zumu said as he picked up the walking stick. &ldquo;If I
put you back in your head, will you let me take you back to the village
and explain everything to everyone? Then my father and everyone else can
come back here and sort Mister Fing out for good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, of course, whatever you want,&rdquo; the crow&rsquo;s head said. &ldquo;My
real body is under a sheet out back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu took a small bottle off Mister Finger&rsquo;s workbench and ran to the
rear of the workshop with the walking stick tucked under his arm. The
back door&rsquo;s hinges went <em>squeeeeeeeak</em> when he opened it.</p>
<p>Outside, the observatory&rsquo;s bulk blocked most of the light from the
storage tanks. In what little there was, he spotted something as big as
he was lying under a canvas sheet on an old picnic table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; the crow&rsquo;s head squawked. &ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu sprayed a little light in the air to help him see. &ldquo;Careful!&rdquo; the
crow&rsquo;s head squawked. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get any on me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu grabbed the sheet and pulled. Part of the moldy canvas tore away in
his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my,&rdquo; he breathed. He was looking straight into the eyes of a
dragon.</p>
<p>No&mdash;a dragon&rsquo;s <em>head</em>. It was as big as a steel drum, and its sharp
beak was curved like a crow&rsquo;s, but that was all there was&mdash;just a
head. Its dark scales glistened as the light faded away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up!&rdquo; the crow&rsquo;s head squawked. &ldquo;Put me back in my head before
Mister Fing finds us, or the snarly-dogs will have us both for dinner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wings fluttered above Zumu&rsquo;s head as he pried open the hatch on top of
the dragon&rsquo;s head and unscrewed the crow&rsquo;s head from walking stick. An
uneasy feeling in his stomach made him hesitate.</p>
<p><em>Bang!</em> The door opened behind him. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; Mister Fing bellowed.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! It&rsquo;s a monster!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t listen to him,&rdquo; the crow&rsquo;s head squawked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it, boy!&rdquo; Mister Fing said again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what took the
light away! It can&rsquo;t <em>stand</em> light!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu hesitated. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t listen to him,&rdquo; the crow&rsquo;s head cawed.
&ldquo;<em>He&rsquo;s</em> the one who makes everybody grub around in the forest all day
long, and for what? For what? A bunch of robots!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m warning you,&rdquo; Mister Fing said loudly. He pointed a fat finger
at Zumu. &ldquo;If you put it back in its head, you&rsquo;ll wish the snarly-dogs
had gotten you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if on cue, the biggest and ugliest of the snarly-dogs came racing
around the corner. It growled deep in its throat and began stalking
toward Zumu.</p>
<p>Zumu flipped the cane over. A dark green emerald fell into his hand. He
held it up high. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come any closer!&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;Or
I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll smash this! And then you&rsquo;ll never be able to fix any of
the robots ever again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t dare!&rdquo; Mister Fing spat.</p>
<p>Zumu never got to find out if he would dare or not. A sharp beak
snatched the emerald out of his hand. &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; he shouted, but the crow
had already landed on the dragon&rsquo;s head. It dropped the emerald into
the waiting slot and flipped the hatch closed with a sinister <em>snick</em>.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Chapter 19</h2>
<p>Life sparked in two dark eyes. &ldquo;Finally&hellip;&rdquo; it hissed. It opened a
beak as wide as Zumu&rsquo;s outstretched arms and cawed.</p>
<p>Zumu clapped his hands over his ears, deafened. Above his head and all
around, thousands of small wings made a sound like a forest in a
hurricane as the crows answered the call.</p>
<p>The first ones to arrive clamped their beaks onto the dragon&rsquo;s neck.
The next ones nestled into the spaces between them, grabbing hold with
their beaks and claws wherever they could. Slowly at first, then faster
and faster, a long, lean body began to take shape. It was made of crows,
Zumu realized dumbly. The dragon was actually made up of crows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noooooo,&rdquo; Mister Fing moaned, flapping his hands as if to scare away
the sight in front of him. &ldquo;No no no no noooooo&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu stumbled backward until his shoulder blades met the observatory
wall. The dragon paid no attention to him. Instead, a dark, scaly leg
reached past Zumu to pick up the barking snarly-dog and toss it into the
air. <em>Snap! Gulp!</em></p>
<p>The dragon licked its beak. &ldquo;Tasty&hellip;&rdquo; it rumbled. It blinked its
enormous eyes, then swiveled its head to focus on Mister Fing. &ldquo;My oh
my, it feels <em>so</em> good to be back,&rdquo; it hissed softly. &ldquo;How clever do
you feel <em>now</em>, number two oh seven three three? Hm? How&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>It stopped suddenly, a peculiar look on its face, then snaked its head
around on its long neck. &ldquo;My tail!&rdquo; it snarled. &ldquo;My beautiful,
beautiful tail! All those crows you spoiled&mdash;now there isn&rsquo;t enough
of me to make a tail! I gave you the very best brain I had, and <em>this</em>
is how you thank me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mister Fing opened and closed his mouth like a gasping fish. The
dragon&rsquo;s wings rustled ominously. &ldquo;You were <em>supposed</em> to clean my
head and put my brain back in right away, weren&rsquo;t you? Wasn&rsquo;t that
what I said? Clean and replace, so I could get started building a nest
on this silly little world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mister Fing finally found his voice. &ldquo;I just wanted them to be free,&rdquo;
he whimpered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm, but then you had second thoughts, didn&rsquo;t you? What if it meant
that you wouldn&rsquo;t be in charge any more? What if it meant they started
having ideas of their own? Well, there&rsquo;ll be no more ideas for you
now.&rdquo; A pointy black tongue flickered across the dragon&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>At that, Mister Fing bellowed in terror and fled around the curved side
of the observatory. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; the dragon hissed wickedly.
&ldquo;Run. Run as fast as you can.&rdquo; It stretched like a cat waking up after
a long nap, then spread its wings and sprang into the air.</p>
<p>Zumu picked up the bottle he had dropped. He heard a roar like thunder
overhead, and Mister Fing&rsquo;s terrified cries. &ldquo;What have I done?&rdquo; he
whispered. Bottle in hand, he crept cautiously around the side of the
building.</p>
<p>The dragon was crouching on the grass by the storage tanks. It had
pinned Mister Fing down with one enormous foot. Steam&mdash;no,
smoke&mdash;rose from the dragon&rsquo;s scales wherever light touched it, but
it didn&rsquo;t seem to care.</p>
<p>Mister Fing saw Zumu before the dragon did. &ldquo;The light, boy, the
light!&rdquo; he bellowed. &ldquo;Use the light!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dragon whipped its head around to glare at Zumu. It hissed, its
tongue flickering inside its beak like a black flame. Zumu stepped back
and raised the bottle of light. His fingers tightened on the trigger
instinctively. A thin line of light shot out and hit the dragon&rsquo;s wing.</p>
<p>The dragon reared back, screaming with pain and anger. Mister Fing
scrambled to his feet and took three clumsy steps toward the storage
tanks. The dragon pounced on him again. &ldquo;Spray it again, boy, spray it
again!&rdquo; Mister Fing shouted, kicking and wriggling.</p>
<p>As Zumu took aim, the dragon took a deep breath. Some ancient instinct
made Zumu throw himself to one side. The dragon spat a greasy purple
flame. &ldquo;Aaagh!&rdquo; Zumu yelped as it scorched the soles of his sandals.</p>
<p>The dragon took another deep breath. Zumu sprinted for the door. He
yanked it open and dove through, slamming it shut behind him just a
heartbeat ahead of another stream of fire. As he sprinted down the
corridor, he heard Mister Fing scream, &ldquo;No! No! Nooooo!&rdquo; Then there
was nothing except the sound of his sandals going <em>whup, whup,</em> <em>whup</em>
on the floor.</p>
<p>Down the corridor. Turn the door handle. Pull&mdash;no, push. Across the
walkway to the ladder.</p>
<p>Something heavy landed on the building&rsquo;s domed roof. Zumu heard the
dragon&rsquo;s angry &ldquo;Sssss&hellip;&rdquo; through the slot in the roof as he
scrambled down the ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out, come out, little mouse. I&rsquo;m <em>hungry</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was just enough light leaking out of the pipes on the floor for
Zumu to find the small lens on Mister Fing&rsquo;s workbench. He pointed it
straight up and squirted a beam of light onto it.</p>
<p>A white-hot lance shot out of the other side of the lens. It sizzled
through the air right in front of the dragon&rsquo;s nose, so close that Zumu
saw it reflected in the creature&rsquo;s eyes. It screamed and threw itself
into the sky, wings beating like thunder.</p>
<p><em>What do I do now?</em> Zumu asked himself frantically. He couldn&rsquo;t go
outside, not with the dragon waiting for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out, come out, little mouse,&rdquo; the dragon&rsquo;s voice said again.
Zumu fired another beam of light into the air.</p>
<p>The dragon just chuckled. &ldquo;Oh, you won&rsquo;t catch me that way twice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you <em>doing</em> this?&rdquo; Zumu moaned. &ldquo;Why did you destroy our
town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m a dragon,&rdquo; the dragon snapped, &ldquo;And dragons need nests.
Nice dark nests, without any horrible light to burn us. And lots of
rubies, so we can make robots to do those things that have to be done in
the light, things that need hands, things that are beneath us. Oh, you
have no idea how far I came, little mouse, how long I traveled to find
this world. It&rsquo;s mine now. <em>You&rsquo;re</em> mine. Come out now, and I promise,
I&rsquo;ll make it quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu pressed the heels of his hands against his eyes. There had to be a
way out. There had to be some way to use the light to&mdash;</p>
<p>The light. In the storage tanks. He tried to picture them in his mind.
Were they close enough to the observatory? And could he&hellip;?</p>
<p>He ran over to the controls he had seen Mister Fing use to steer the
telescope and sprayed some light into the air above them. There, that
one&mdash;that was the one he had used. With his heart in his throat, Zumu
pulled on the lever.</p>
<p>The telescope rumbled and began to tilt upward. Zumu hastily pushed the
lever the other way. &ldquo;Too slow, little mouse,&rdquo; the dragon hissed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <em>much</em> faster than that. Now, come outside, and&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Zumu snapped. &ldquo;Could you please be quiet? I&rsquo;m trying to
concentrate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the moment of startled silence that followed, Zumu grabbed the wheel
next to the lever and spun it around. Slowly, slowly, the whole roof of
the observatory began to turn, carrying the telescope with it. &ldquo;Come
on, come one,&rdquo; Zumu muttered. &ldquo;Come <em>on</em>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pipes on the floor creaked and groaned, then sprung apart. As the
light inside them spilled onto the floor, Zumu saw the dragon poking its
head through the telescope&rsquo;s slot. &ldquo;I have you now, little mouse! I
have you now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the end of the telescope hit the first storage tank. The whole
building shuddered. &ldquo;What?!&rdquo; The dragon yanked its head out of the
observatory. &ldquo;What are you doing? No! No! You can&rsquo;t&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>The telescope kept turning. Metal shrieked and groaned. Somewhere under
Zumu&rsquo;s feet, a motor whined. &ldquo;Please please please please please&hellip;&rdquo;
Zumu begged.</p>
<p>Sounding like the end of the world, the storage tank toppled over,
crashing into the one beside it. <em>KABOOM!</em> The light that Mister Fing
had stolen from the world billowed out into the sky as the tanks fell
over one after another. It rolled across the sky in a great wave.</p>
<p>The dragon&rsquo;s scream rose and rose until it was a high-pitched whistle.
Zumu heard its thick hide sizzle. The whole observatory shook, throwing
him to the ground.</p>
<p>The next thing he knew, he was lying on the workshop floor, staring up
at the sky through the slot in the roof. He could see&mdash;he could see
<em>everything!</em> The machines, the dust, the walkway, even the curved
ceiling over his head. And the sky&mdash;he could see the sky! It was
blue!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s blue,&rdquo; he said in awe. &ldquo;The sky is blue!&rdquo; He scrambled to his
feet and ran out the back door, laughing. The sky really was blue, and
so big that he couldn&rsquo;t see all of it at once.</p>
<p>His laughter suddenly caught in his throat. There, beside the wreckage
of the light storage tanks, stood Mister Fing. His hat lay at his feet.
The bandage that had held the hatch in his head closed for so many years
hung down over one of his ears, and&mdash;Zumu gulped. Mister Fing&rsquo;s head
was open. His right arm was still raised, as if he was waving. The
dragon had made Mister Fing take his own ruby out&hellip;</p>
<p>The rubies! Zumu ran back into the observatory and scrambled down the
ladder. Yes, they were still there, all the rubies Mister Fing had cut
and kept for himself over all those long, dark years. Zumu swept them
into a sack, then went out the back door to collect the crow&rsquo;s head
cane. Picking it up, he took a ruby from the sack and slipped it into
the slot where the dragon&rsquo;s emerald had been.</p>
<p>The crow&rsquo;s head blinked. &ldquo;Good morning!&rdquo; it cawed. &ldquo;How can I help
you today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half an hour later, a footsore but smiling young boy walked into the
town his people had been forced to flee a generation before. It was
beautiful: the houses were brightly painted, the sidewalks swept, and
there wasn&rsquo;t a bump or pothole to be seen on any of the streets. The
robots were milling around in confusion, each asking its neighbor,
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening? What are we supposed to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zumu stepped up onto the lip of the fountain. &ldquo;Hey! Over here! Everyone
who wants a new brain, make a line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do we need new brains?&rdquo; one of the robots demanded.</p>
<p>Zumu&rsquo;s smile broadened. &ldquo;So you can make some new friends.&rdquo; Walking
down the mountain into town, he had been able to see the village on the
other side of the little valley. It was closer than he had realized.
Once the robots had brains as good as #20717&rsquo;s had been, it wouldn&rsquo;t
take them very long to get there at all.</p>
<p>As he waited for the robots to line up, he wondered what it would be
like for his little brother to grow up in a world where there was so
much light that even the sky had a color. He was looking forward to
finding out.</p>
