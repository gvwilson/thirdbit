<blockquote>
<p><strong>A Warning</strong></p>
<p>You probably think this is a Christmas story because of the santas,
but it&rsquo;s not:
it&rsquo;s about right and wrong and figuring out who you are
and how when one door opens another closes and vice versa.
There are many footnotes and explosions but only one kiss.
Oh,
and if you need someone to hold your hand during the scary bits
you&rsquo;re out of luck.
I&rsquo;m just a book, and we don&rsquo;t have hands.</p>

<section>
<h2>We Meet Our Protagonist</h2>
<p>Once upon a time,
in a world halfway between yours and mine,
lived a young santa named Finner.
He came from a long line of santas:
his mother had boxed and wrapped her first wind-up singing wombat
when she was not much bigger than a wombat herself,
while his father started helping with deliveries
as soon as he was reliably out of diapers.<sup id="fnref:reliably"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:reliably">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Everyone could tell that Finner was a santa the moment he was born:
people said his tiny little beard was the cutest thing they&rsquo;d ever seen.
And as he grew up,
he loved santafying—at least, he tried to.
After all,
who <em>wouldn&rsquo;t</em> enjoy slithering down a sooty chimney
or trying to land a sleigh on a yurt without leaving a single dent in its stiff felt roof?
But no matter what he did,
a small voice in Finner&rsquo;s head said, &ldquo;Me.
I don&rsquo;t enjoy this.
Or rather, I do, but it&rsquo;s not enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What he <em>did</em> enjoy,
at least for a while,
was going into the workshop and helping the family&rsquo;s elves.
The smell of solder,
the <em>shick shick</em> of freshly-sharpened scissors,
the feeling of the two halves of a dovetail joint fitting perfectly together—they
felt right in a way that clambering up the icy concrete side of an apartment building
never did.</p>
<p>His parents tolerated it at first.
&ldquo;Good for him to know how things are made,&rdquo;
they told each other.
After a while, though,
they began hinting that maybe he should being ho-ho-ho&rsquo;ing in the attic
rather than sewing or gluing.
And a while after that,
Finner could tell that the hints were about to become
a number three talk from his father,<sup id="fnref:number-three-talk"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:number-three-talk">2</a></sup>
so he put the tools he had borrowed from the elves back in their boxes
and pretended he couldn&rsquo;t hear their hammering any longer.</p>
<p>And so Finner became more restless every day.
His mother suggested running up and down three flights of stairs over and over
to burn off the energy,
but it only made him sweaty.
He tried sitting cross-legged on the floor with his eyes closed
and humming softly to himself like
the monks of Lotse Nuffin,<sup id="fnref:lotse-nuffin"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:lotse-nuffin">3</a></sup>
but all he got was a cold bum.</p>
<p>He tried to talk to his friends about it
without actually explaining the problem,
but that didn&rsquo;t go well.
Finner&rsquo;s parents weren&rsquo;t the only santas in town.
There were others nearby—aunts and uncles
and second cousins twice removed
and even a few who&rsquo;d married into the trade
and done quite well for themselves
despite what Finner&rsquo;s great-grandmother
never actually said out loud at family gatherings.<sup id="fnref:loudly"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:loudly">4</a></sup>
But they were all related to him somehow,
and none of the other children Finner went to school with or played hide and seek with
really understood the problem.
Santas didn&rsquo;t <em>make</em> things—they <em>delivered</em> them.
That&rsquo;s how it was,
that&rsquo;s how it had always been,
and as far as everyone was concerned,
that was how it was always going to be.</p>
<p>For a while he wondered if he was just lazy,
which was a synonym for &ldquo;sinful&rdquo; where he lived,
so he tried a few experiments.
Working twice as hard made him even sweatier than running up and down stairs.
Working half as hard made his father ask if he was sick and his mother mutter about teenagers.
Neither made the yearning in his chest for <em>something</em> go away.
It grew and grew until finally,
desperately,
he realized there was only one thing left for him to do.
He would have to ask his great-grandmother for advice.</p>
<p>Gran-Granna Tumbly spent most of her time napping,
but she had been one of the greatest santas ever.
She had once delivered a chocolate orange cake to a trio of scientists in a submarine
<em>without using a submarine herself</em>,
and then delivered a baby on the way home.<sup id="fnref:deliver-baby"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:deliver-baby">5</a></sup></p>
<p>Everyone was a little bit afraid of her,
except for the unfortunate few who had felt the full force of her disapproving glare:
they were a <em>lot</em> afraid.
But if you had a problem—a <em>real</em> problem,
not just a lost sock or a broken heart<sup id="fnref:broken-heart"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:broken-heart">6</a></sup>—you could
always knock on her door.</p>
<p>Finner waited until Tuesday afternoon before going to see her.
The postman delivered<sup id="fnref:postal-delivery"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:postal-delivery">7</a></sup>
her weekly order of chocolate on Tuesday just before lunch,
and Finner hoped that would put her in a good mood.
&ldquo;Or at least a less grumpy one,&rdquo; he thought
as he trudged through the damp, clumpy snow that had fallen overnight.
The last time he had seen her had been the family gathering at Long Night the year before.
Finner&rsquo;s uncle had accidentally served Gran-Granna a cup of camomile tea,
and had squirmed for an hour as she drank it one slow, withering sip at a time.</p>
<p>The Tumbly house looked exactly like those on either side of it:
a front door with an evergreen wreath on it,
a large curtained window to one side,
and a pair of smaller windows with matching curtains on the floor above.
The downstairs window had a warm, welcoming glow,
and even from the street Finner could smell curry and freshly-baked bread.
The only remarkable thing was a statue of a cat sitting on an round pedestal
in the middle of the front yard,
its stone eyes fixed on a snow-filled bird bath.<sup id="fnref:remarkable-yard"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:remarkable-yard">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Finner took a deep breath, walked up to the door, and knocked.
When nothing happened he knocked again.
&ldquo;Well that was a bust,&rdquo; he said aloud,
secretly relieved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She just nipped out to get some broccoli,&rdquo; a voice rumbled behind him.
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind waiting a moment…?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner turned around slowly.
The stone cat had turned its head toward him,
but was clearly still keeping one eye on the empty bird bath.
&ldquo;I—sure,&rdquo; he said lamely,
then added, &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo;
because a stone statue of a cat is still in some sense a cat,
and one of the first lessons a santa is taught is
to always be polite to cats.<sup id="fnref:polite-to-cats"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:polite-to-cats">9</a></sup></p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; the cat rumbled.
It turned its head back toward the bird bath,
and together they waited in silence.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have to wait long.
A tricycle taxi rolled up in front of the house and wheezed to a gentle stop.
The taxi pedaller climbed out of his seat,
stretched until his spine went <em>pop!</em>,
nodded at Finner (or possibly the cat),
and then opened the cab door and helped Gran-Granna Tumbly down.
Pocketing the half-coins she handed him,
he climbed back onto his seat and pedalled away.</p>
<p>Finner belatedly remembered that he was an able-bodied youth
and Gran-Granna was neither.
&ldquo;Can I carry that for you?&rdquo; he asked,
hurrying back down the short walk to the gate.</p>
<p>Gran-Granna Tumbly looked at the broccoli in her hand and snorted.
&ldquo;I think I can manage, thank you,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Did you catch anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh…&rdquo; Finner started, confused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the cat statue rumbled.
&ldquo;But I remain hopeful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmph.&rdquo;
Finner stepped out of the way as Gran-Granna Tumbly walked briskly up the path,
the tip of her cane stabbing through the snow on every second step.
&ldquo;Well, since you&rsquo;re here, you might as well come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m,&rdquo; Finner said obediently.
With one last glance at the motionless cat he followed her through the door
and into the rest of his life.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>A Door Opens</h2>
<p>Finner had never actually been in Gran-Granna&rsquo;s house before,
but he&rsquo;d heard stories.
A richly-patterned carpet in the hall that looked like it might once have been able to fly: check.
A set of coathooks with gargoyle faces: check.<sup id="fnref:gargoyles"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:gargoyles">10</a></sup>
A sitting room filled with a riot of greenery
and a mis-matched pair of overstuffed chairs: check.
Crossed harpoons over the fireplace and dozens of framed pictures
of children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren,
neighbors, friends, enemies,<sup id="fnref:enemies-dates"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:enemies-dates">11</a></sup>
and the grateful, if somewhat perplexed, crew of a submarine: check.</p>
<p>And there was a teapot—<em>the</em> teapot,
the one people spoke about in hushed voices.
It didn&rsquo;t look special,
but it was never empty and its contents were never cold.
Bitter, sometimes,
if that&rsquo;s what guests needed,
but never cold.</p>
<p>Finner waited for Gran-Granna to settle into a chair
before seating himself nervously on the edge of the other one.
She spooned a bit of sugar into a green-and-white teacup,
glanced at him,
added a bit more,
and then poured slowly and carefully.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll want to let that cool down a bit,&rdquo; she advised,
filling the second cup for herself
and sitting back with it cradled in her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo;
Finner said,
not knowing what else to say.
What <em>was</em> he going to say?
&ldquo;Nothing feels right,&rdquo; was awfully vague,
and, &ldquo;What should I do with my life?&rdquo; seemed awfully—</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing about being old,&rdquo; Gran-Granna said without any preamble,
&ldquo;Is that people think it makes you wise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The silence that followed was broken only by
the ticking of the burl clock in the kitchen.
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Finner asked,
because it felt like the kind of statement
that wanted to be invited to take off its coat and sit for a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so far as I can tell,&rdquo;
Gran-Granna sighed.
She sipped her tea,
eyes half-closed like a cat having its ears scratched.
&ldquo;But it does give you a passel of stories to tell.
Take your Auncle Minglin, for example.&rdquo;
She gestured at a picture on the wall of someone Finner vaguely remembered
having spilled cranberry juice on a white tablecloth at some point.
&ldquo;Kind heart,
and a beautiful singing voice,
but as clumsy as an ox on ice skates.
They could trip over a rock that was clear across the other side of the street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So no deliveries?&rdquo;
Finner ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s certainly the conclusion they reached.
And they were pretty down in the mouth about it,
let me tell you.
The world needs doctors and airship pilots and what-not,
but when when you&rsquo;ve been told your whole life that you&rsquo;re destined for something else,
well,
it&rsquo;s hard to change direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner turned his teacup around in his hands.
&ldquo;So what happened to them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gran-Granna smiled.
&ldquo;They ran off and joined the opera.
Last I heard,
they were singing six shows a week with not an empty seat in the house.&rdquo;
She sipped her tea.
&ldquo;The way I look at it,
they <em>did</em> become a santa.
They&rsquo;re giving people the gift of music night after night
and that&rsquo;s no small thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sighed.
&ldquo;But they don&rsquo;t see it that way,
and I don&rsquo;t know if they ever will.
Doesn&rsquo;t matter how hard people applaud
or how many times they&rsquo;re called back for encores—deep in their heart,
they&rsquo;ll always think of themself as &lsquo;not at santa&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which brings us to you,&rdquo; she continued,
bright eyes fixed on Finner,
who at that moment desperately regretted having come to see her
and wished he could be almost anywhere else in the world.<sup id="fnref:geography-volcanoes"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:geography-volcanoes">12</a></sup></p>
<p>&ldquo;M-me?&rdquo; Finner stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, y-you,&rdquo; Gran-Granna said impatiently.
&ldquo;Your folks have been worried about you for a while now.
Oh, I know, you didn&rsquo;t think anyone had noticed,
but you&rsquo;ve been mopey and anxious
and all the other things young people get carried away with these days,
only more so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A clock chimed quietly in the kitchen next door.
Somewhere in the distance,
someone called for their children to come inside,
it was time for bed and their teeth weren&rsquo;t going to brush themselves.
&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t know what to do,&rdquo; Finner confessed,
angry at the tears that he was absolutely <em>not</em> going to cry.
&ldquo;I like the ho-ho-ho&rsquo;ing,
but deliveries are—&rdquo;
He paused for breath.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like everyone else is excited about it but I&rsquo;m just watching myself do it,
you know?
Like this is someone else&rsquo;s life and I&rsquo;ve just put it on like a sweater
except it doesn&rsquo;t quite fit
and no matter how many times I wash it,
it&rsquo;ll still smell a bit like whoever it really belongs to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmph,&rdquo;
Gran-Granna Tumbly snorted.
&ldquo;Fancy words like that,
maybe you ought to think about becoming a writer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Finner mumbled.<sup id="fnref:stories-and-poems"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:stories-and-poems">13</a></sup></p>
<p><em>THUMP!</em> He jumped as something heavy hit the floor in the room overhead.
&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gran-Granna picked up her cane and struggled to her feet.
&ldquo;Dearie me, look at the time,&rdquo; she said curtly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure your folks will be wondering where you are.
You best be—&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>THUMP!</em> &ldquo;Ow, get off me!&rdquo; a female voice said peevishly.</p>
<p>Finner reached for his great-grandmother.
&ldquo;I think someone&rsquo;s up there,&rdquo; he whispered loudly.</p>
<p>Gran-Granna rolled her eyes.
&ldquo;Door,&rdquo; she said, pointing at it with her cane.
&ldquo;You. Through it. Now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vidancia! Vidancia, where are you?&rdquo;
a second voice bellowed from above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet!&rdquo; the first voice said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vidanci-ulp!&rdquo;
Finner practically heard someone putting their hand over someone else&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>He gestured weakly toward the front door.
&ldquo;Well, um, I&rsquo;ll just—&rdquo; he started.</p>
<p>Heavy boots thumped on carpeted steps
as the biggest, beardiest santa Finner had ever seen came downstairs
and wrapped his arms around Gran-Granna Tumbly
in a number three hug.<sup id="fnref:number-three-hug"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:number-three-hug">14</a></sup>
To Finner&rsquo;s complete surprise the santa started crying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Vidancia,&rdquo; he blubbered.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful.
It&rsquo;s <em>awful</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gran-Granna Tumbly wriggled out of the beard and the hug.
&ldquo;Let me guess—did your llamas eat your favorite hat again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The llamas are gone,&rdquo;
said a second santa
who had come silently down the stairs behind the first one.
She was no taller than Finner,
but lean where the first santa was brawny,
and her uniform—Finner did a double take.
Her hood and sack were red and white,
but the rest was changing color to match the carpet on the stairs.
And—was that an ax strapped to the first santa&rsquo;s back?
A really big ax that looked like it was designed for chopping off heads
rather than for turning logs into kindling?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean &lsquo;gone&rsquo;?&rdquo; Gran-Granna demanded,
pulling a handkerchief out of her sleeve and handing it to the big santa
in a way that clearly meant,
&ldquo;Stop sniffling and get ahold of yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean they are gone.
No longer in their proper surroundings.
Ex-located.
Completely, utterly, elsewhere.&rdquo;
The second santa sat down heavily on the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re hurt,&rdquo; Gran-Granna said accusingly.</p>
<p>The second santa waved her off.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing.
Just some broken ribs.
And maybe an eardrum.
One of my presents went off a little early,&rdquo;
she added with a wicked grin.</p>
<p>The burly santa wiped his eyes on a sleeve that Finner could have used as a sleeping bag.
&ldquo;The elves were helpin&rsquo; me load up the stagecoach for a delivery,
just like they always do,
an&rsquo; then <em>blam!</em>&rdquo;
He smacked a meaty fist into an equally meaty palm.
&ldquo;There they were,
all over us.
I tried to fight &lsquo;em off, Vidancia, I swear.&rdquo;
His lower lip trembled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you did,&rdquo; Gran-Granna said gently.
&ldquo;What about your elves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out through the emergency chimney,&rdquo;
the second santa said.
She shifted and winced.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re safe.
At least,
as safe as anyone right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned her gaze on Finner.
Something very much like a mild electric shock ran down his spine
as her dark eyes locked with his.
&ldquo;And who&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Before anyone could answer there was another pair of <em>thumps</em> upstairs.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; a somewhat disappointed voice buzzed a moment later.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not exactly a palace, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The burly santa growled and reached for his ax.
The one on the stairs struggled to her feet.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; she spat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it appears,&rdquo;
Gran-Granna Tumbly said grimly.
She twisted the head of her cane
and to Finner&rsquo;s absolute dumbfoundment<sup id="fnref:dumbfoundment"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:dumbfoundment">15</a></sup>
drew a slender silver rapier.
&ldquo;Hold this,&rdquo; she ordered,
handing the remaining cane-y bit of the cane to Finner,
and then everything went a little bit nuts.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>A Moderate Amount of Mayhem</h2>
<p>The second santa pulled a grenade out of her sack,
drew the pin with her teeth,
and chucked it overhand up the stairs.
&ldquo;Bang,&rdquo; she said calmly.
Sure enough,
a second later there was a loud <em>crack!</em>
Bilious green foam began expanding into the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t hold them for long,&rdquo;
Gran-Granna Tumbly said,
twisting at the waist until her spine made a noise
made a <em>crack</em> of its own that was only slightly quieter than the grenade&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can take &lsquo;em!&rdquo; the big santa bellowed,
hefting his totally intimidating ax,
which was in fact larger than Finner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No we can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Gran-Granna snapped.
A UPOF<sup id="fnref:upof"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:upof">16</a></sup>
crashed through a window upstairs
and landed in the front yard with a wet <em>thud</em>.
Boots and broken glass clattered on the porch roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That window <em>does</em> open,&rdquo; Gran-Granna Tumbly muttered.
Sparkles ran down the rapier in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that a <em>magic</em> sword?&rdquo; Finner breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not magic enough,&rdquo; their great-grandmother snapped.
&ldquo;You two! Chimney! Now! And you.&rdquo;
She pointed at Finner.
&ldquo;You go with them and you do exactly what they say, understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go where?&rdquo; Finner didn&rsquo;t have a chance to ask,
because at precisely that moment something roared in the front yard.
It was the kind of sound that bypasses the ears
and goes directly to the bit in the back of the brain
that evolved to keep a million generations of ancestors
out of the stomachs of large predators.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What—&rdquo; someone in the front yard started to say but never managed to finish.
Someone else simply screamed, briefly.
A sound like a dozen empty cans being crunched together
was followed by a moment of stunned silence,
and then the shooting started.</p>
<p>The burly santa yanked Finner under the shelter of his enormous ax.
Bullets ricocheted off it to make lethal little holes in the pictures on the walls.
The other santa dove across the room to take shelter beside Finner.
Punctured in a dozen places,
the green foam in the stairs made a wet, farty noise
and began to deflate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get to the chimney!&rdquo; Gran-Granna Tumbly shouted.
Her sword flashed back and forth,
knocking bullets away from them.<sup id="fnref:teapot-bullets"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:teapot-bullets">17</a></sup></p>
<p>The big santa picked him up like a sack of laundry
and took two enormous strides across the room
and something <em>twisted</em>,
Finner didn&rsquo;t see exactly what or how,
but suddenly Gran-Granna&rsquo;s fireplace was gone,
or rather it was still there but it was also a doorway,
like one of those puzzle pictures that looks like two different things at once,
and then everything stretched around them
or possibly they did the stretching
and they were somewhere else.</p>
<p>It was bright.
In fact,
it was daytime,
when a moment ago it had been dark and evening.
And there was sand—lots of sand.
And—</p>
<p>&ldquo;That looks like a pyramid,&rdquo;
a small part of Finner&rsquo;s brain<sup id="fnref:brain-pyramid"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:brain-pyramid">18</a></sup>
told the rest of him.</p>
<p>The second santa got to her feet and brushed sand off her uniform,
which had already started to turn a dusty beige.
&ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>It took Finner a moment to realize she was asking him.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said helplessly.
It was hot, he realized.
Much too hot for the winter coat he was wearing.
And where was Gran-Granna?</p>
<p>The santa stared at him.
Her eyes widened.
&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said to the big santa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I said,&rdquo; Finner was about to reply,
but before he could,
a voice behind him moaned,
&ldquo;Greeeetinnngs…&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spun around and found himself face-to-face with—he wasn&rsquo;t quite sure what.
It was tall and withered
and wrapped in tattered bandages
made from the rags of what might once have been a santa&rsquo;s uniform.
Its eyes didn&rsquo;t quite line up,
and—was that a <em>bone</em> of the end of one of its arms
where there really ought to be a hand?<sup id="fnref:mechanical-hand"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:mechanical-hand">19</a></sup></p>
<p>The burly santa hefted his ax.
&ldquo;Friend or foe?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>The mummy santa smiled, or more accurately bared its large, yellow teeth.
&ldquo;That depends on…
whether you brought…
tea.
And treats…
for my pets.&rdquo;
At the word &ldquo;treats&rdquo;,
one of the giant cat statues at the base of the pyramid
turned its head and blinked,
which made the &ldquo;stay out of predators&rdquo; part of Finner&rsquo;s brain go, &ldquo;Ding ding ding!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tea?&rdquo; the burly santa asked,
clearly never having had this particular response to his friend-or-foe question before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She always…
brings tea.
And treats.
And sometimes…
a magazine?&rdquo;
the mummy santa finished hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No magazines, I&rsquo;m afraid, and no tea either,&rdquo;
the lean santa said,
her uniform a perfect match for the sand around them.
&ldquo;We had to leave Sensei Tumbly&rsquo;s in rather a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ssss…&rdquo;
The mummy hissed with disappointment.
&ldquo;I suppose…
you&rsquo;re going…
to claim…
refuge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lean santa elbowed her burly companion&rsquo;s ribs to stop him from speaking.
&ldquo;As is our right,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;A cookie, a glass of milk, and the use of your chimney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heh.
Heh.
Heh.&rdquo;
The mummy said the words one by one with somewhat unsettling pauses between them.
&ldquo;No milk…
or cookies…
here.
Not for…
a long…
time.&rdquo;
The giant stone cat behind it stepped down from its pedestal.
Finner gulped as three more joined it.
Some seemed to be missing minor parts like ears or tails,
but that didn&rsquo;t do anything to quiet the <em>ding ding ding!</em> in his brain.
&ldquo;So tell me…
why I…
should say yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lean santa reached into her sack.
For a heartbeat Finner thought she was going to throw another foam grenade,
but instead she pulled out a complicated piece of clockwork
that had probably been breathtaking before
the explosion that had clearly bent some of the gears
and left scorch marks on others.</p>
<p>The mummy hissed again.
&ldquo;You bring…
<em>that</em>…
here!?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The santa hefted her sack.
Loose pieces of metal clinked against one another.
The mummy hissed again,
and the cats around it growled.
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be a bunny,&rdquo; the santa said dismissively.
&ldquo;It would take a dozen elves a week to put it back together,
and anyway,
I didn&rsquo;t manage to salvage a battery.&rdquo;
She jerked her chin at the santa with the ax.
&ldquo;They found a way through his chimney.
And took his llamas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>And</em> smashed my stagecoach,&rdquo;
the big santa added.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Least I got my elves away safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lean santa shook her head.
&ldquo;Safe for now,
but if we don&rsquo;t figure out where they&rsquo;re coming from
or how they&rsquo;re using the chimneys,
they&rsquo;re going to take away everything we care about.&rdquo;
She was exhausted,
Finner realized,
but trying hard not to show it.</p>
<p>The mummy hissed sympathetically.
&ldquo;I know…
how…
you feel…
child.&rdquo;
It looked past her at the dry sand surrounding them.
&ldquo;This was…
green…
once…
But that…
was long ago…&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the stone cats yowled softly.
The mummy straightened.
&ldquo;Yes…
I will…
grant you…
refuge.
Follow…
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It turned toward the pyramid,
then hesitated.
&ldquo;And…
please…
don&rsquo;t mind…
the mess.
I&rsquo;m…
redecorating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they climbed the worn stone steps on the pyramid
Finner sidled over to the lean santa.
&ldquo;Can you please tell me what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sighed.
&ldquo;The usual, I&rsquo;m afraid.
We&rsquo;re trying to save the worlds.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Some Introductions</h2>
<p>Zombies and mummies are similar in many ways—the shambling gait,
the moaning,
and of course the whole &ldquo;undead&rdquo; thing—but
there are important differences.
First,
mummies are generally royalty,
or the servants of royalty,
while zombies tend to have been idiots who went into the basement after dark
despite the strange sounds they heard
or didn&rsquo;t run fast enough when someone shouted,
&ldquo;Look out, they&rsquo;re coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Second,
mummies are created through a complex multi-step process
during which the internal organs and the brain are removed,
packed in salt,
and stored in canopic jars.
&ldquo;Which is…
just a…
fancy word…
for jars…
that hold…
someone&rsquo;s…
squishy bits,&rdquo;
the mummy explained as they climbed the stairs
to an entrance in the side of the pyramid
that was actually quite large
but seemed quite small compared to the pyramid.</p>
<p>Third,
and perhaps most importantly,
zombies devoured the brains of the living.
&ldquo;Or sometimes…
their livers…&rdquo;
the mummy wheezed.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a…
cultural…
thing.&rdquo;
Mummies,
on the other hand,
were strictly vegan:
<em>very</em> strictly,
since they didn&rsquo;t eat at all.
&ldquo;Though…
we do…
enjoy a…
nice cup…
of tea,&rdquo;
the mummy added wistfully.</p>
<p>Two stone cats sat on their haunches at the top of the steps.
One blinked slowly as they entered the pyramid,
but other than that they might truly have been statues.
Inside was a corridor with sloping sides,
wide enough for the four of them to walk side by side.
Torches guttered in sconces every few dozen strides,
their light making the figures painted on the walls dance.<sup id="fnref:walls-dance"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:walls-dance">20</a></sup></p>
<p>The corridor turned into a ramp,
which turned left and left again,
each leg slightly shorter than the one before.
Just as Finner realized they were climbing the inside of the pyramid
they reached their destination.
&ldquo;Voila,&rdquo;
the mummy rasped,
waving them forward proudly.</p>
<p>To call the chamber they entered a &ldquo;room&rdquo; would have been like calling the pyramid &ldquo;large&rdquo;.
If Gran-Granna Tumbly&rsquo;s house had been tucked into one corner
there would still have been plenty of room for a hockey rink and a river barge.
And while there wasn&rsquo;t actually a hockey rink,
there <em>was</em> a barge,
along with dozens of statues,
a chariot,
six life-sized wooden horses,
a small catapult,
and a workbench covered with tools,
bits of wood,
rolls of fabric,
and a stack of magazines.</p>
<p>There was also something that looked suspiciously like Gran-Granna&rsquo;s living room.
&ldquo;Please…
sit down…&rdquo;
the mummy told them,
gesturing at a matched pair of blue-and-gold striped couches.
&ldquo;I know…
it&rsquo;s not…
much…
to look at…
but…&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s amazing,&rdquo; the lean santa said
when the mummy&rsquo;s pause stretched longer than usual.
&ldquo;And I <em>love</em> what you&rsquo;ve done with the side tables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I…
refinished those…
myself,&rdquo;
the mummy said proudly.
&ldquo;Here…
let me…
show you…
the originals.&rdquo;
It pulled a magazine out of the pile on the workbench
and flipped through it,
muttering under its lack of breath.
&ldquo;There!
What do…
you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It thrust the magazine at the lean santa
while the burly one plopped himself down on the nearest couch,
which creaked slightly under his weight.
Finner sat hesitantly on the other
while the lean santa said appreciative things about stains and lacquers
and agreed that of <em>course</em> you had to see it in the room
to really appreciate it,
particularly with such difficult lighting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; Finner finally interrupted,
after trying and failing twice to screw up enough courage to speak.
&ldquo;But can someone please tell me what&rsquo;s going on?
And,
um,
how I can get home?
Because I&rsquo;d like to do that.
if that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo;
he added apologetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get there from here,&rdquo;
the lean santa said,
setting aside the filigree tea tray
that the mummy had casually mentioned was an antique.<sup id="fnref:antique-living"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:antique-living">21</a></sup>
&ldquo;Emergency chimneys are one-way.
But I&rsquo;m sure Sensei Tumbly is all right,&rdquo;
she added quickly.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a tough old bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tough as they come,&rdquo; the burly santa agreed, nodding.
&ldquo;Why, there was this time—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you keep calling her that?&rdquo;
Finner interrupted angrily.
&ldquo;And where <em>are</em> we?
And would you <em>please</em> tell me what&rsquo;s going on,
and who you are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three santas exchanged looks.
The lean santa sighed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Santa Hood.
This is Santa Greenwood, and…?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Santa Hotep,&rdquo;
the mummy supplied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is what, an alternate universe?&rdquo;
Finner asked.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not stupid,&rdquo; he added when Santa Hood raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of them,&rdquo; she confirmed.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re each the santa in our world.
A lot only have one,&rdquo;
she explained before Finner could ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds kind of lonely,&rdquo;
was all Finner could think to say.</p>
<p>Santa Hood shrugged.
&ldquo;It works out.
Some people think we&rsquo;re why all those universes exist.
Every kind of santa that can be, must be.
It&rsquo;s some kind of quantum thing.&rdquo;
She shrugged again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what kind of santa are you?&rdquo;
Finner asked.</p>
<p>She grinned wickedly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the kind that steals presents from the rich and gives them to the poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner digested that for a moment.
&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re the kind that chops down trees and gives everyone firewood as a gift?&rdquo;
he asked Santa Greenwood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;
the burly man growled.
&ldquo;The gifts are for the trees.
The ax is for anyone who tries to hurt &lsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t…
brought anyone…
a gift…
in years,&rdquo;
Santa Hotep wheezed wistfully in the awkward silence that followed.
&ldquo;After…
the oasis…
dried up…
they all…
moved away.
It&rsquo;s peaceful…
but…
I do miss…
the unwrapping…
sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santa Hood patted the mummy&rsquo;s hand.
&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve certainly kept yourself busy.
This place looks <em>amazing</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have…
Miz Tumbly…
to thank…
for that.&rdquo;
The mummy took a faded magazine off a lovely lacquered bookshelf,
its pages stiff with age.
&ldquo;She felt…
sorry for me…
And started…
bringing me…
these.
It was…
the nicest thing.
I hope…
she&rsquo;s…
all right.&rdquo;
It paused.
&ldquo;Or if not,&rdquo;
it added reflectively,
&ldquo;I hope…
Someone will…
wrap her.
It would…
be nice…
to have…
company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Sensei Tumbly is fine,&rdquo;
Santa Hood said firmly.
She stood and slung her sack over her shoulder with a wince.
&ldquo;But we should keep moving.
Headquarters needs to know about the attack,
and we have to find a way to get Findlay here home&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Finner, actually,&rdquo;
Finner corrected,
or would have if an ear-splitting yowl hadn&rsquo;t interrupted them.</p>
<p>Santa Greenwood surged to his feet,
his ax in his hands,
as Santa Hotep drew a circle with its fingertip on the mirror by its elbow.
The mirror&rsquo;s surface rippled and reformed to show
the steps leading up to the pyramid entrance,
where the stone cats were fighting a quartet of hooded figures
wielding swords and ray guns
whose brilliant green beams left glassy scorches on the sand.<sup id="fnref:glassy-scorches"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:glassy-scorches">22</a></sup></p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo;
Santa Hotep wheezed angrily.
&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have,&rdquo;
Santa Hood snapped.
&ldquo;We need to get out of here <em>right now</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santa Hotep nodded.
&ldquo;This way.&rdquo;
It shambled off,
moaning under its breath.<sup id="fnref:not-actually-breathing"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:not-actually-breathing">23</a></sup></p>
<p>The chamber was even larger than Finner had realized.
He froze as one of the statues turned its head.
&ldquo;Automated defenses,&rdquo;
Santa Hood said without breaking stride.
&ldquo;Pretty standard in a place like this.
I <em>am</em> a thief,&rdquo;
she added over her shoulder.</p>
<p>Santa Hotep led them to a completely unremarkable patch of the wall.
&ldquo;Left…
left…
right…
and ah…
whoopsie doo…&rdquo;
it recited
as it did a slow shuffling dance.
The tiles beneath its feet went <em>click</em>.
With the slightest of scraping sounds
the enormous stone block in front of it pivoted
to reveal another passage,
smaller and narrower than the one they had climbed
but lit by the same flickering torches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After…
you…&rdquo;
The mummy waved them ahead.
Santa Greenwood squeezed through the opening,
muttering under his breath.<sup id="fnref:actually-breathing"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:actually-breathing">24</a></sup>
Finner followed with Santa Hood on his heels.</p>
<p>Up, up, up they went.
The passage cut back on itself so often that Finner began to feel dizzy.
He was just about to ask how much further it was
when he rounded a final bend and was almost blinded by
the bright blue square of empty sky in front of them.
That,
and the dazzling green beam of a ray gun blast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jet packs,&rdquo; Santa Greenwood spat
&ldquo;Of <em>course</em> they&rsquo;d have jet packs.&rdquo;
He brought up his ax
just in time for the next shot to bounce off its shiny blade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the chimney?&rdquo; Santa Hood demanded as the mummy caught up with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right…
in front…
of you…&rdquo;
it wheezed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything!&rdquo; Santa Greenwood shouted,
deflecting another shot.
And then he bellowed, &ldquo;AAAAHHH!&rdquo;
because the mummy
(who was much stronger than it looked)
pushed all three of them out into the empty air
where they fell screaming to their deaths.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>A Last-Minute Rescue</h2>
<p>At least,
that&rsquo;s what Finner expected would happen
in the heart-stopping second before the universe
did its &ldquo;see it both ways&rdquo; trick again
and the desert was an ocean,
a beautiful blue ocean with nice soft waves instead of nasty bone-breaking solid ground.</p>
<p>Santa Greenwood made the biggest splash:
between his size and hitting the water in a spread-eagle bellyflop,
he actually, briefly, made a dent in the water.
Finner had only a moment to admire how Santa Hood tucked in her elbows
to plunge into the water as gracefully as a seahawk diving for fish
before he discovered the hard way that the water was very, very cold.</p>
<p>He spluttered to the surface,
thrashing his arms against the weight of his suddenly-sodden coat.
It was heavy,
and his boots felt like concrete blocks on his feet.
&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; he spluttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Periwinkle!&rdquo; Santa Greenwood roared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m working on it!&rdquo; Santa Hood shouted back.
She pulled something bright orange out of her sack.
With a sharp <em>pop!</em> and a hissing sound it began to inflate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful with your stupid ax!&rdquo; she yelled at Santa Greenwood
as she tossed her sack into the little dinghy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m bein&rsquo; careful! And it ain&rsquo;t stupid!&rdquo; the burly santa yelled back.
A dozen powerful one-armed strokes
and he dragged himself up onto the dinghy,
nearly flipping it over in the process.</p>
<p>Finner was too busy not drowning to really notice this, though.
He&rsquo;d managed to kick off one boot<sup id="fnref:one-boot"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:one-boot">25</a></sup>
and was struggling to unbutton his coat
when Santa Hood popped up beside him like an otter and said,
&ldquo;Easy, easy, let me do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Panting and kicking furiously to stay afloat,
Finner squelched his panic long enough
for Santa Hood&rsquo;s deft fingers to undo his buttons
and hold his sleeves so that Finner could pull out his arms.
The heavy blue coat floated away,
taking with it a handkerchief,<sup id="fnref:handkerchief"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:handkerchief">26</a></sup>
a folded piece of paper with a game of Hangman on it
left over from a particularly boring writing class at school,
and a mostly uneaten piece of toffee.</p>
<p>A few moments later Santa Hood boosted Finner into the dinghy
and pulled herself over the gunwale as well.
&ldquo;Y&rsquo;aright?&rdquo;
Santa Greenwood asked,
wringing seawater out of his beard.
He had a bit of seaweed in his hair,
Finner noticed.</p>
<p>Santa Hood nodded, shivering.
&ldquo;Lucky th-this isn&rsquo;t of those worlds
where the ch-ch-chimney connects to a drowned city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heh.
You remember Santa Kraken?&rdquo;
Santa Greenwood shook himself like a very large dog
and laid his ax across his knees,
glaring at the ocean
as if a billion liters of salt water could be intimidated.</p>
<p>Santa Hood forced a smile,
her teeth chattering.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have something in your sack to keep you warm?&rdquo;
Finner asked,
hoping the answers would be &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;I have a spare&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But Santa Hood shook her head.
&ldquo;Used it a c-couple of chimneys ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santa Greenwood patted her shoulder awkwardly.
&ldquo;Well,
at least we&rsquo;re okay for now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Right on cue,
a triangular gray fin sliced through the water beside them.
&ldquo;Is there a Santa Shark?&rdquo; Finner asked weakly,
hoping the answers would be &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;it&rsquo;s actually very friendly&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Santa Hood shook her head.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m af-fraid so,&rdquo; she said grimly,
her teeth still chattering.
&ldquo;But she takes everything she c-can
and never g-gives <em>anything</em> back.
Be c-careful with that!&rdquo; she snapped
as Santa Greenwood hefted his ax.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m bein&rsquo; careful!&rdquo; Santa Greenwood said,
and then three things happened more or less simultaneously:<sup id="fnref:simultaneously"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:simultaneously">27</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A second, larger gray fin appeared in the water beside the first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The edge of Santa Greenwood&rsquo;s ax brushed against the dinghy&rsquo;s rubber gunwale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was a sharp <em>crack!</em>
    like someone snapping a piece of wood over their knee
    and a cannonball whistled over their heads.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; Finner shouted instinctively as:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The larger gray fin changed course to head straight for them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Air began feeping<sup id="fnref:feeping"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:feeping">28</a></sup> out of the dinghy;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A set of black sails crested the horizon.
    There was another <em>crack!</em>
    and a second cannonball whistled overhead
    to splash into the water nearby.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Santa Greenwood stood up,
nearly causing the others to spill into the ocean
as the dinghy rocked dangerously.
&ldquo;Come on, Periwinkle, gimme something!&rdquo; he roared,
hefting his ax again.
&ldquo;Chili grenades! Tangle muffins! Anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m out!&rdquo; Santa Hood,
her arm deeper in her sack than basic physics should have allowed.<sup id="fnref:basic-physics"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:basic-physics">29</a></sup></p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Finner shouted
as a wooden ship crested the horizon.
It was painted the same menacing black as the sails.
There was an orange flash on her deck and another <em>crack!</em>.
A third cannonball hit the water between the dinghy and the circling gray fins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ya gormless nabblers!&rdquo; Santa Greenwood bellowed,
shaking his ax so hard that he lost his footing.
Finner grabbed the santa&rsquo;s belt to stop him from falling out of the dinghy
and was nearly pulled out himself.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;tcha come here an&rsquo; try that, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A fourth <em>crack!</em>, another cannonball.
The ship was close enough now that Finner could see
crew in the rigging and on the deck
shouting and waving.
&ldquo;Wait! They&rsquo;re not shooting at us!&rdquo;
Finner exclaimed.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re shooting at the sharks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or they just can&rsquo;t aim!&rdquo;
Santa Hood snapped,
her arm still deep in her sack.</p>
<p>And then the smaller gray fin decided it was now or never
and changed course and raced toward them.
The shark the fin belonged to was a menacing dark bulk just below the surface.</p>
<p>Finner could feel the dinghy softening beneath his bootless foot
as Santa Greenwood tried to stand up again
and Santa Hood ducked so as not to be beheaded by the ax
he actually wasn&rsquo;t being very careful with.
&ldquo;Got it!&rdquo; she said triumphantly.
She pulled something out of her sack and threw it.</p>
<p>There was a loud bang.
Sea water splattered all over them.
Finner&rsquo;s eyes immediately began itching and streaming.
&ldquo;One last ch-chili bomb,&rdquo; Santa Hood said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahoy!&rdquo; a distant voice called as the two gray fins turned and fled.<sup id="fnref:sharks-flee"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:sharks-flee">30</a></sup>
&ldquo;Might ye be in need of assistance there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santa Greenwood&rsquo;s face fell.
&ldquo;Oh, not him,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;Anyone but him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Finner and Santa Hood asked simultaneously.</p>
<p>The black ship came up beside them.
Rope ladders were already draped over her side,
each with a sailor hanging from it with their arm out.
With a one, two, and <em>three</em> (Santa Greenwood being rather heavy)
the dinghy was left empty in the ship&rsquo;s wake.<sup id="fnref:empty-dinghy"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:empty-dinghy">31</a></sup></p>
<p>Finner clambered up the rope ladder and on to the deck.
Given recent events,
he was completely unsurprised to find himself face-to-face with another santa.
But what a santa:
between the eyepatch,
the skull earrings,
the peg leg,
the parrot (who had a peg leg of her own)
and the very large and very sharp cutlass in his hands,
<em>this</em> was the kind of santa other santas dreamed of being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ain&rsquo;t you the lucky ones?&rdquo; the santa boomed,
a twinkle in his eye.
&ldquo;Us happenin&rsquo; along just now an&rsquo; all.
Coulda been mighty dicey there, mighty dicey indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were doin&rsquo; all right,&rdquo; Santa Greenwood muttered sullenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, I could see that,&rdquo; the pirate santa said,
straight-faced.
&ldquo;Ah, but where&rsquo;s me manners?
I&rsquo;m Cap&rsquo;n Clausbeard,
an&rsquo; this is my crew.&rdquo;
He waved his sword to include the dozen figures
now standing around and behind the new arrivals,
all of whom just happened to have sharp pieces of metal or thuddy things<sup id="fnref:thuddy-things"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:thuddy-things">32</a></sup>
in their hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Santa Hood,&rdquo;
Santa Greenwood said reluctantly.
&ldquo;And Figleaf—they&rsquo;re Miss Tumbly&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Finner,&rdquo; Finner corrected automatically.
No-one noticed.</p>
<p>The pause stretched awkwardly
until Santa Greenwood sighed heavily and gestured at Captain Clausbeard.
&ldquo;And <em>this</em> is my dad.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:my-dad"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:my-dad">33</a></sup></p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Some Explanations</h2>
<p>A few busy minutes later,
Finner was sitting in a slightly cramped cabin
with a thick blanket wrapped around his shoulders
and a steaming mug of something called seaweed tea in his hands.
Santa Hood was somewhere under an even larger blanket on the bunk opposite his stool,
while Santa Greenwood had solved the problem of being too big for the available furniture
by sitting on the floor.
<em>Deck,</em> Finner corrected himself.
<em>It&rsquo;s called a deck on a ship.
Which this is.</em></p>
<p>He shook himself.
&ldquo;About the whole &lsquo;saving the worlds&rsquo; thing,&rdquo; he ventured.</p>
<p>Santa Greenwood swallowed a swig<sup id="fnref:swig"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:swig">34</a></sup> of tea
and set the mug on the deck beside his ax.
&ldquo;They showed up a while back,&rdquo; he said,
looking at and through the wall opposite him.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Bout the time I was your age, actually, so maybe more than a while.
Anyway,
at first they were all talk.
Folks ought to do deliveries year round,
and they ought to deliver groceries and such as well as actual presents,
that kind of thing.
Made no sense,
but folk figured there was no harm in lettin&rsquo; them talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who are &lsquo;they&rsquo;?&rdquo; Finner asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A handful of misguided santas,&rdquo;
Santa Hood&rsquo;s muffled voice said from under the blanket.
&ldquo;People get notions sometimes,
especially on the worlds where there&rsquo;s only a few of them or even just one.
The loneliness gets to them after a while
and they go a little odd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Callin&rsquo; it &lsquo;odd&rsquo; is more polite than I&rsquo;d be.&rdquo;
Santa Greenwood picked up his mug and scowled at its contents.
&ldquo;And when sensible folk wouldn&rsquo;t listen to their nonsense,
they took matters into their own hands.
They started makin&rsquo; <em>stuff</em>, like socks and cutlery and what-not.&rdquo;
His scowl deepened.
&ldquo;Nothing wrong with that—everybody likes gettin&rsquo; socks<sup id="fnref:everybody-likes-socks"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:everybody-likes-socks">35</a></sup>
but they made more of it than anyone had ever seen.
And instead of puttin&rsquo; it in the basement or a barn or something decent
until it was time to deliver it,
they just went and gave it right away to—to <em>everyone</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In broad daylight,&rdquo; Santa Hood added tiredly
as Santa Greenwood glared into his tea.
&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t even care if people had been naughty or nice.
They just gave things to everyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they didn&rsquo;t wrap &lsquo;em, either,&rdquo; Santa Greenwood added heatedly.
&ldquo;Folk might&rsquo;ve let them get away with it for a while
if they&rsquo;d at least <em>wrapped</em> things,
but—&rdquo;
He shook his head.
&ldquo;It was disrespectful, is what it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo;
Wrapping had never been Finner&rsquo;s favorite chore,<sup id="fnref:favorite-chore"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:favorite-chore">36</a></sup>
but the thought of what his parents or Gran-Granna Tumbly would say
if a present went into a sack without being wrapped made his stomach do flip-flops.
&ldquo;So…?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santa Hood pulled her blanket down enough for her head to be visible.
&ldquo;Once they got going
it turned out that a lot of people agreed with them.
Pretty soon it wasn&rsquo;t just a handful of santas from backwater worlds—there were hundreds of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hundreds!&rdquo;
Santa Greenwood grunted.</p>
<p>Santa Hood shrugged under her blanket.
&ldquo;And just when everyone thought they couldn&rsquo;t do anything worse,
they let all their elves out of their basements.
Or you know, their caves or wherever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner&rsquo;s mouth went dry
the way it always did when he thought about elves.
&ldquo;What do you mean?
My parents let our elves out all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santa Hood shook her head.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean just to run errands and get parts and what-not.
They <em>let them out</em>.
They let them just walk around wherever they wanted
and have their own houses and make more of themselves,
as many more as they wanted.&rdquo;
Her eyes blazed.
&ldquo;Do you have any idea how dangerous that could be?
One elf makes another so now you have two.
Each of them makes another, so now there&rsquo;s four,
then eight, then— then—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixteen,&rdquo; Finner supplied helpfully.<sup id="fnref:powers-of-two"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:powers-of-two">37</a></sup></p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixteen,&rdquo; Santa Hood agreed.
&ldquo;Pretty soon there&rsquo;d be more of them than us,
and then—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elfageddon,&rdquo; Santa Greenwood finished solemnly.
&ldquo;The end o&rsquo; worlds.
No more presents, no more deliveries—no more anything, most like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought you said they wanted to make deliveries all the time.&rdquo;
Finner protested,
then swallowed dryly at the looks the other two santas gave him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just givin&rsquo; people stuff ain&rsquo;t <em>deliveries</em>,&rdquo; Santa Greenwood spat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Giving who what?&rdquo; boomed Captain Clausbeard,
who had just opened the cabin door without bothering to knock.
His parrot squawked something in his ear.
&ldquo;Ah. Right. Them.
Anyway, what&rsquo;s it like bein&rsquo; back in your old cabin, eh, lad?
Must bring back memories, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santa Hood raised an eyebrow.<sup id="fnref:raised-eyebrow"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:raised-eyebrow">38</a></sup>
&ldquo;This was <em>your</em> cabin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santa Greenwood growled but didn&rsquo;t reply.
Santa Hood jerked her chin at a pencil drawing of a tropical island
nailed up beside the cabin&rsquo;s single round porthole.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were so artistic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my boy was a wizard with all that stuff,&rdquo;
Captain Clausbeard said proudly.
&ldquo;And even better at crochet.
Why, I still have a couple of doilies that—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <em>think</em>,&rdquo; Santa Greenwood interrupted,
&ldquo;I think we oughta focus on the problem at hand, don&rsquo;t you?
Namely how we&rsquo;re going to get Fiddler—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;—back to Miz Tumbly
and how we&rsquo;re gonna get my llamas and elves back to <em>me</em>
and what in the name of rain we&rsquo;re going to do about these,
these <em>troublemakers</em>,
because I for one have had <em>enough</em>!&rdquo;
He thumped his meaty fist on the deck,
making Captain Clausbeard&rsquo;s parrot<sup id="fnref:parrot"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:parrot">39</a></sup> squawk.</p>
<p>Whatever the captain might have said in reply to that
was cut off by a cry from the crow&rsquo;s nest.
&ldquo;Smoke, cap&rsquo;n!
We got smoke on the horizon!
North by nor&rsquo;west,
a hundred fathoms up an&rsquo; headed our way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The humor dropped from Captain Clausbeard&rsquo;s face like spilled porridge.
&ldquo;Well, lad, are ye fit to fight?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fit enough.&rdquo;
Santa Greenwood clambered to his feet,
swore as his head hit the ceiling,
and picked up his ax.</p>
<p>Captain Clausbeard nodded.
&ldquo;Glad t&rsquo; hear it.
Your friends can stay here &lsquo;til we know whether we&rsquo;re eatin&rsquo; peaches or pickles.
That&rsquo;s an order,&rdquo; he added as Santa Hood opened her mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; she said neutrally.</p>
<p>Captain Clausbeard raised an eyebrow<sup id="fnref:eyebrow-no-shiver"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:eyebrow-no-shiver">40</a></sup>
but said nothing before stomping out,
his peg leg thumping on the deck.
&ldquo;Avast, ye scallywags!&rdquo; he bellowed.
The door closed behind him.</p>
<p>Santa Greenwood hefted his ax.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about us,&rdquo;
Santa Hood said perkily,
wriggling a bit to free herself from her blanket&rsquo;s embrace.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be safe in here.
Besides, I&rsquo;m not done studying this masterpiece of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner expected Santa Greenwood to scowl or make a joke.
Instead, he spoke quietly, without looking at either of them.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Isla del Tesoro.
It was my first forest.
More of a jungle, really,
but there were trees big as masts with these great beards o&rsquo; moss hangin&rsquo; off them.
The rest o&rsquo; the crew didn&rsquo;t like it—they all got itchy
as soon as they were out of earshot o&rsquo; the waves,
but you could walk for hours an&rsquo; see nothin&rsquo; that wasn&rsquo;t green.
First time I spent the night there felt like comin&rsquo; home.
Drawin&rsquo; that picture felt like makin&rsquo; myself a promise.
Kinda surprised my dad left it up,
what with all the arguin&rsquo; we did when I told him I was leavin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a long moment the only sounds were the creaking of the ship&rsquo;s timbers
and muffled shouts from the crew.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be safe in here,&rdquo;
Santa Hood repeated,
her tone as soft as Santa Greenwood&rsquo;s had been.</p>
<p>Santa Greenwood nodded,
yanked the door open,
swore as his forehead hit the lintel,
and closed the door behind him.
Santa Hood rolled her head to work out a kind in her neck.
&ldquo;So,&rdquo; she said conversationally,
letting the blanket slide down so that Finner could see
the ray gun she was holding,
which just happened to be aimed at his chest.
&ldquo;How about you tell me who you really are?&rdquo;</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>An Airborne Attack</h2>
<p>Finner&rsquo;s hands put themselves up.<sup id="fnref:hands-up"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:hands-up">41</a></sup>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Finner!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Finner Tumbly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh huh.
And I suppose you want me to believe that
you just <em>happened</em> to be in sensei&rsquo;s house when those elves attacked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner&rsquo;s mouth worked.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know they were going to attack!&rdquo; he finally managed to get out.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know about, about chimneys to other worlds,
I don&rsquo;t know why you call my gran-granna &lsquo;sensei&rsquo;—I don&rsquo;t know anything
about <em>any</em> of this!
I just want to go <em>home</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santa Hood studied his face for a moment,
then flipped the ray gun over and offered it to him.
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t work unless you&rsquo;re an elf,&rdquo; she explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why were you pointing it at me!?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corner of Santa Hood&rsquo;s mouth quirked up.
&ldquo;Would you feel better about that if I <em>had</em> been able to shoot you with it?
Here, take it.&rdquo;
She leaned forward to pass it to him and winced.</p>
<p>Finner put it on the tiny desk he&rsquo;d been sitting on.
&ldquo;How are your ribs?&rdquo; he asked sulkily.</p>
<p>Santa Hood shook her head.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had worse.
You don&rsquo;t learn to make the kinds of presents I make
without getting a few bumps and bruises.
Your gran-granna taught me that.
That&rsquo;s why I call her &lsquo;sensei&rsquo;,&rdquo; she added.
&ldquo;When all this trouble started
she was one of the first santas to say we had to do more than just talk.
She started teaching people how to fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner would have said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo;
except he did.
The stone cat in Gran-Granna&rsquo;s front yard,
her magic sword—even without all of that,
the idea that she had been some sort of soldier or ninja or whatever
was perfectly in character.
He still had questions,
but what he said was,
&ldquo;Can I get you anything for your ribs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santa Hood snorted, which made her wince again.
&ldquo;Some tea would be nice,
but I think we&rsquo;d both better stay down here for now.
I&rsquo;m going to try to get some sleep—wake me up
if anything exciting happens?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few moments later she was snoring gently beneath her pile of blankets.
Finner put his head down on the little desk and tried to fall asleep as well,
but the rock and sway of the ship made his stomach flip-flop
every time he closed his eyes.
Finally he sat up,
rolled his head from side to side to get a kink out of his neck,
and picked up the ray gun Santa Hood had given him.</p>
<p>It looked like a well-made toy with its gnurled grip and shiny barrel,
but was heavy in a way that said,
&ldquo;No, I can actually make holes in things.&rdquo;
He pointed it at the porthole,
closed one eye,
and said, &ldquo;Blam!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A brilliant green beam of light blasted the glass right out of the porthole.
Finner gaped,
still feeling the hum of the shot in his hand,
then tossed the ray gun onto the desk as if it had just bitten him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wuzza?&rdquo; Santa Hood grunted in her sleep.
Finner held his breath until she rolled over under blankets
and started snoring again.
The ray gun just lay there the whole time
like an unopened note for his parents from his writing teacher.<sup id="fnref:writing-teacher"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:writing-teacher">42</a></sup></p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Finner muttered under his breath.
He picked up the ray run gingerly,
holding it with just his thumb and one finger,
and twisted it around to study it.
There were no buttons that he could see,
especially not one labeled &ldquo;turn on for santas&rdquo;,
but the porthole was still definitely glassless.
Santa Hood must have been wrong about it only working for elves.</p>
<p>He brightened slightly.
Maybe it only worked for teenagers.
Maybe instead of just being baggage<sup id="fnref:baggage"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:baggage">43</a></sup>
he could actually help Santa Hood
(and Santa Greenwood too, of course).
For a moment he saw himself standing beside them,
blasting away with the ray gun while his new-found teammates tossed their grenades
and waved their ax menacingly.
Maybe he could even—</p>
<p><em>Crack!</em>
<em>Crack!</em>
The whole ship shuddered beneath his feet as the cannons above him fired.
Shouts rang on the deck outside the cabin.
&ldquo;Wuzza!?&rdquo; Santa Hood grunted again, sitting up.
&ldquo;Wuz g&rsquo;non?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay here,&rdquo; Finner said firmly.
He tucked the ray run into his trousers,
then imagined what would happen if it went off again
and transferred it to his pocket.<sup id="fnref:unfortunate-incident"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:unfortunate-incident">44</a></sup>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right back,&rdquo; he promised
as he pulled the cabin door open
and stepped out into chaos.</p>
<p>Half a dozen sailors were firing rifles and crossbows into the air.
Half a dozen others were reloading the ship&rsquo;s cannons
as Captain Clausbeard and his parrot<sup id="fnref:parrot-time"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:parrot-time">45</a></sup>
bellowed orders.
In between them,
Santa Greenbeard was hacking at an enormous black tentacle with his ax.
No, not a tentacle—it was a metal cable as thick as Finner&rsquo;s arm,
and it hung down from the blue-and-gray airship that was now above the ship.</p>
<p>A second cable fell from the airship as Finner gaped up into the sky,
and then a third.
The sailors&rsquo; bullets and arrows had no more effect on the airship
than Santa Greenwood&rsquo;s ax had on the cable.
&ldquo;Stand by to repel boarders, ye grumble-fisted knucklewaddlers!&rdquo;
Captain Clausbeard shouted,
drawing his cutlass and passing a tiny replica of it to the parrot,
who clutched the sliver-sized blade in its beak.</p>
<p><em>Crack!</em>
<em>Crack!</em>
The cannons fired again.
Something thunked into the deck a few steps away from Finner
and began spewing smoke.
The cable snagged on a hatch and went taut.
<em>Snap!</em>
Finner ducked as half of the hatch flew through the air
and splashed into the ocean.</p>
<p>Someone yelled,
&ldquo;Here they come, cap&rsquo;n!&rdquo;
as half a dozen elves slid down the cable,
letting go just as they reached the height of the mast.
<em>Thump!</em> <em>Thump!</em> <em>Thump!</em>
The first three hit the deck,
tumbled head over heels,
and rolled to their feet with swords in their hands.</p>
<p>Finner only half-noticed the others catch themselves
in the ship&rsquo;s rigging—he was too busy scrambling backward to get away
from the swordfight that had erupted around him
to do any more than that.
Steel rang against steel.
Captain Clausbeard and his crew pressed hard against the elves,
their blades flashing.
For a moment it looked like the attack would be over as soon as it had begun,
but more elves kept coming,
and more after them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Away wi&rsquo; ye!&rdquo; Santa Greenbeard bellowed.
With one might swing of his ax
he sent two of the elves flying over the gunwale.<sup id="fnref:gunwale-sharks"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:gunwale-sharks">46</a></sup>
His backswing snapped another elf&rsquo;s sword in half.
He raised the ax over his head,
took aim—</p>
<p>—and froze as a dart the length of Finner&rsquo;s thumb
suddenly sprouted from the side of his neck.
&ldquo;Oh drat,&rdquo; he said weakly.
The ax slid out of his hands.
He fell to one knee, then both,
his hand reaching for the dart as his eyes unfocused.</p>
<p>Finner spun around.
A single elf dressed in black hung in the rigging of the foresail,
a blowgun in its hand.
The elf caught Finner&rsquo;s eye and grinned
as it pulled another dart from the pouch on its belt
and put it between its teeth.
It raised the blowgun to its lips and took aim.</p>
<p>Afterward,
Finner could never remember actually drawing the ray gun.
It was just suddenly there in his hand.
A single brilliant bolt of green punched a smoldering hole in the foresail
just a few inches from the elf&rsquo;s head.
&ldquo;Bwah!?&rdquo; the elf tried to say,
then, &ldquo;Uh oh.&rdquo;
It glared accusingly at Finner,
spat out the dart it had just swallowed,
and sagged in the rigging like a straw doll
hanging forgotten in a tired child&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Finner didn&rsquo;t give himself time to think.
He spun around and fired again and again.
His shots went wild,
but all of a sudden it was no longer
just a battle between the elves and the pirates.
It was a battle between the elves and the pirates and <em>him</em>,
and the elves hadn&rsquo;t counted on that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their ship!
Blast their blasted ship, boy!&rdquo;
Captain Clausbeard shouted.
Finner squinted,
pointed the ray gun into the air,
and pulled the trigger
just as the deck swayed beneath him.
He took aim again,
flexing his knees in time with the ship&rsquo;s roll and heave,
and—</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;
His hand flew to his neck.
There was something there.
There was—wait,
did he have a gym sock in his mouth?
It sure tasted like he did.
He turned his head sloooowly
and blinked at a second black-clad elf holding a blowgun,
and then everything went away,
including him.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Shelves Full of Arms and Legs</h2>
<p>When Finner was next aware of his own existence,
his head was several feet away from his body.
At least,
that&rsquo;s how he felt until he blinked,
squelched the panic rising in his throat,
and opened his eyes again to discover that
he was in fact lying on a padded table of some kind
in what looked like an operating room.
His mouth no longer tasted like a gym sock,<sup id="fnref:gym-sock"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:gym-sock">47</a></sup>
but his tongue still seemed a size larger than usual,
and the straps around his wrists and ankles
were just a little too tight to be comfortable.</p>
<p>His brain paused and reversed
like a driver noticing an overlooked parking spot.
Why was he strapped down?
More importantly,
why was he strapped down in what looked like an operating room?
Half a dozen possible explanations raced through his mind,
each less comforting than the last.</p>
<p>He was about to call for help when the door opposite his feet slid open.
An elf wearing a white lab coat and a matching white mask stepped into the room,
exclaimed,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re awake!&rdquo;
and fled,
closing the door again behind themself
without waiting for Finner to confirm or deny the observation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Could someone please—um, could someone please let me up?
I think I need to go to the bathroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door slid open again.
The elf who entered this time was taller than the first one
and wore a blue and white uniform instead of a lab coat.
The ray gun in her hand was a twin of the one Finner had fired,
except hers had several tally marks scratched on the barrel
and was pointed at Finner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she scowled,
&ldquo;You have thirty seconds to convince me that we shouldn&rsquo;t just pitch you over the side,
so start talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I—&rdquo;
<em>I just want to go home,</em> he finished in his head,
but what he said was,
&ldquo;I really do need to use the bathroom.
Please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elf scowled at her a moment longer,
then turned her head slightly.
&ldquo;Gamma Three!&rdquo; she called without taking her eyes off Finner.
She held the ray gun steady as the smaller elf came in
and unbuckled the straps holding Finner down.</p>
<p>He sat up and rubbed his wrists.<sup id="fnref:rub-wrists"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:rub-wrists">48</a></sup>
The elf waggled her ray gun toward the door.
&ldquo;Out and to the right,&rdquo; she said curtly.
&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t try anything funny.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:try-funny"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:try-funny">49</a></sup></p>
<p>&ldquo;To the right&rdquo; was a narrow corridor with painted metal walls
and a rubberized floor.
Flat strips set into the ceiling cast orange light
on doors like the one that slid closed behind them,
each with a number and a cryptic legend like &ldquo;Aux. Battery&rdquo; stenciled on it.
&ldquo;One eighty one,&rdquo; the elf told Finner.
He fumbled with the door&rsquo;s handle for a moment before figuring out that
he needed to turn it clockwise,
then sighed with relief at the sight of a perfectly normal toilet and sink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right here,&rdquo; the elf warned
as she leaned back against the opposite wall and crossed her arms.
Finner nodded and slid the door shut.</p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;ve been telling this story more or less as it happened
because that&rsquo;s what books are supposed to do.
I haven&rsquo;t bothered with details
like the precise color of Santa Hotep&rsquo;s couch (dusty rose)
or the number of sails on Captain Clausbeard&rsquo;s ship (seven)
because they didn&rsquo;t seem important.
The two and a half minutes that Finner spent in the bathroom matter even less,
so let&rsquo;s just skip ahead to the moment after he washed his hands.</em></p>
<p>Finner fumbled with the door handle again and then slid the door open.
The elf hadn&rsquo;t moved,
and neither had her scowl,
but her ray gun was holstered on her hip instead of in her hand.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; she ordered,
nodding to show the way.
&ldquo;And no funny busi—damn, why do they always run?&rdquo;
Because of course that&rsquo;s what Finner did.</p>
<p>The floor rang metallically under his boots as he pelted down the corridor.
The first door he tried was locked.
So was the second,<sup id="fnref:second-door"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:second-door">50</a></sup>
but the handle of the third turned and clicked.
He slid the door out of his way,
ducked in,
and pulled the door closed again as quietly as he could.</p>
<p>The room was completely dark.
Finner patted the wall next to the door
until he found a switch,
then hesitated.
It might be a light,
but it might also—he wasn&rsquo;t quite sure what,
but given how things had been doing,
&ldquo;set off an alarm&rdquo; and &ldquo;open a trap door&rdquo; both seemed possible.
Instead,
he pressed his ear gingerly to the door
and listened for sounds of pursuit.
There was nothing,
nothing except his own breathing
and the deep <em>thrum thrum thrum</em> of something large and mechanical.</p>
<p>He turned,
put his back against the door,
and slid down to the floor.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said,
and then he had to hug his knees and press his face into them
so that he wouldn&rsquo;t start crying.
He had no idea where he was,
but he was pretty sure these were the elves who had attacked Gran-Granna Tumbly&rsquo;s
and chased him and the two santas from one universe to another
and he was glad he&rsquo;d had a chance to go to the bathroom
but he was <em>hungry</em>
and he just wanted to go home and be miserable there.</p>
<p>The moment passed,
as such moments always do.
He wiped his face on his trousers,
got to his feet,
and flipped the switch by the door.<sup id="fnref:flip-switch"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:flip-switch">51</a></sup></p>
<p>It was, in fact, just the lights.
Four strips in the ceiling came to life,
casting the same orange light as the ones in the corridor.
Instead of numbered doors,
though,
these ones showed Finner a scene straight out of a nightmare.</p>
<p>The room was the same size as the one he had woken up in.
Instead of a padded table it had floor-to-ceiling shelves
stacked with arms, legs, heads, and clear plastic boxes full of bones and gears.
Every shelf was neatly labelled and everything was tidy,
but somehow that was more frightening than helter-skelter piles would have been.</p>
<p><em>Mannequins,</em> he thought wildly.
<em>Robots. Props for the theater.</em>
Because of course they couldn&rsquo;t actually be—be what they looked like.</p>
<p>Swallowing hard,
he stepped forward and poked the nearest leg with his finger.
It yielded slightly,
just like the real thing,
but it didn&rsquo;t twitch and the toes didn&rsquo;t wiggle
so at least there was that.</p>
<p>He was just about to poke it again when the door slid open behind him.
Grabbing it by the ankle and raising it like a club,
he whirled around.
&ldquo;Keep back!&rdquo; he warned,
shifting his grip a moment later to get the thigh out of his face.<sup id="fnref:thigh-face"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:thigh-face">52</a></sup></p>
<p>The elf he had run away from looked at him with just a touch of pity in her eyes.
&ldquo;How about you put that back and come with me?&rdquo;
she suggested.</p>
<p>Thirty seconds,
three corners,
and a dozen closed doors later,
the corridor brought them to a ladder with eight brass rungs
that had been polished to silver in patches by use.
Finner clambered up into the murmur and bustle of
the bridge of a airship in flight.
The front wall was made of hexagonal glass panels
held together by thin strips of brass.
The walls to either side were filled with instruments, controls, relays,
and framed photographs of other airships.
A pair of elves in blute and white uniforms paced back and forth beside them,
adjusting dials and jotting notes on clipboards.
Another uniformed elf stood facing the enormous window
with their hands clasped behind their back.
Their straight back and the cutlass at their side practically shouted &ldquo;in charge&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alpha Two reporting with salvage in tow,&rdquo;
the elf behind Finner reported crisply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; the other elf said without turning.
&ldquo;Did the Gammas find anything beyond the usual?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, captain,&rdquo; Alpha Two replied.</p>
<p>The captain nodded.
&ldquo;Dismissed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alpha Two hesitated.
&ldquo;Sir—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it will be all right, Alpha Two,&rdquo;
the captain said smoothly.
&ldquo;If he was going to explode, he would have done so by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alpha Two saluted.
&ldquo;Yes sir.&rdquo;
She grabbed hold of the ladder posts and slid down into the corridor below,
pausing only to give Finner one last scowl
that could have stripped the varnish off an old bench.</p>
<p>Finner waited for the captain to say something.
The moment stretched and stretched until he couldn&rsquo;t bear it any longer.
&ldquo;Um, excuse me,&rdquo; he started,
then stopped in shock as the captain put their hand on the hilt of their cutlass
and turned around.</p>
<p>It was Gran-Granna Tumbly.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>An Escape of Sorts</h2>
<p>People sometimes say, &ldquo;Their jaw dropped,&rdquo;
but that&rsquo;s not what actually happens,
at least not most of the time.
What <em>usually</em> happens is that your mouth opens and closes a few times
because your brain knows you&rsquo;re supposed to say something like,
&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;
but can&rsquo;t find the right words—or even the wrong ones.
It&rsquo;s as if something was stuck in the elevator doors of your mind
and making it go <em>ding! ding! ding!</em> over and over again.</p>
<p>The airship&rsquo;s captain waited patiently for Finner&rsquo;s doors to close.
The other elves glanced at him occasionally but didn&rsquo;t interfere:
keeping an airship flying is tricky even in the best of circumstances,
and if Finner had been paying attention
he would have heard quiet murmurs about damage control crews reporting in
and steering vanes needing in-flight repairs.
The skirmish with Captain Clausbeard&rsquo;s ship had only been
the equivalent of two cats taking swipes at one another
and then pretending each other didn&rsquo;t exist,
but airships are fragile things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gran-Granna?&rdquo; Finner finally managed.
Even as he said it he belatedly realized that the elf wasn&rsquo;t his great-grandmother.
They were too tall and didn&rsquo;t have nearly enough wrinkles on their face.<sup id="fnref:wrinkles-face"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:wrinkles-face">53</a></sup>
Plus,
even if the jingly bells on their hat were stuffed with yarn to muffle them,
they were clearly an elf,
not a santa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Alpha One, actually,&rdquo; the elf said in a clipped voice.
&ldquo;And you must be Finbar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Finner,&rdquo;
Finner corrected automatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finner,&rdquo; the captain repeated.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep that in mind.
So,
what were you doing on board the <em>Dancing Marmot</em>
and how did you come by this?&rdquo;
They held up a familiar ray gun,
then tucked it back in one of the voluminous pockets of their overcoat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um.&rdquo;
Finner cleared his throat.
&ldquo;If the <em>Dancing Marmot</em> is the ship I was just on,
they rescued us from sharks because our rubber dinghy was sinking.
And I got that from one of the santas I was with.
I think she got it from one of the elves who was shooting at us
when we were—um,
well,
there was this pyramid,
and,
um,
look,
I&rsquo;m sorry I shot at your airship.
I didn&rsquo;t know it would actually work.
I hope I didn&rsquo;t hurt anyone,&rdquo;
he added belatedly,
suddenly remembering the glass that wasn&rsquo;t in the porthole of Santa Greenwood&rsquo;s old cabin any longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Number two stabilizer is back in action, captain,&rdquo;
an elf called out from a control panel to Finner&rsquo;s left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Alpha Nine,&rdquo;
the captain said without taking their eyes off Finner&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;Have the crew start work on the vents next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye aye, captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain studied Finner a moment longer,
then sighed.
&ldquo;Well,
we don&rsquo;t really need more crew,
but I don&rsquo;t imagine Command would take kindly to us
throwing you over the side.
One of the Beta watch will find something for you to do until we&rsquo;re docked.
The Rescue Committee can decide how best to help you then.&rdquo;
They nodded sharply in dismissal and turned back around.</p>
<p>Finner stood there a moment,
feeling even more foolish than he had before,
then cleared his throat.
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
the captain said without looking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo;
Finner said.
&ldquo;I really am,
but who are the Rescue Committee and why would they help me?
I really do just want to get home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Committee is responsible for all elves rescued from bondage and servitude,
and for those who escape on their own.
Even those who do so accidentally,&rdquo;
they added pointedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But—but I&rsquo;m not an elf,&rdquo; Finner protested.
&ldquo;I mean,
I know I don&rsquo;t have much of a beard yet,
but—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not an elf,
how were you able to fire the Zap-50?&rdquo;
The captain patted the pocket holding the ray gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo;
Finner said,
immediately angry at himself for the whiny tone in his voice.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m definitely not an elf—just ask my parents.
Or my gran-granna,&rdquo;
he added boldly,
&ldquo;Since you look so much like her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He practically felt the elves on the bridge not looking his way
as the captain turned around and looked at Finner
with absolutely no expression.<sup id="fnref:absolute-expression"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:absolute-expression">54</a></sup>
&ldquo;Alpha Seven,&rdquo; they said neutrally.</p>
<p>One of the elves straightened.
&ldquo;Yes, captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remove him from the bridge.
Find someone from Beta watch who has annoyed me recently
and tell them to keep him busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, captain.&rdquo;
The elf saluted,
then stepped forward and put their hand on Finner&rsquo;s elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can get down the ladder on my own, thank you,&rdquo;
Finner snapped,
shaking off the elf&rsquo;s hand.
He stalked back to the ladder like an angry house cat,
briefly considered trying to slide down the posts the way Alpha Two had,
imagined how humiliated he&rsquo;d feel if he fell or sprained his ankle,
and climbed down the rungs instead,
making far more noise than he needed to.</p>
<p>Alpha Seven used the rungs as well,
though far more quietly.
&ldquo;Second left then a right,&rdquo;
they told Finner,
pointing down the corridor.</p>
<p>Finner did a double take.
The hand the elf had pointed with looked like it was carved out of wood,
and had joints like a marionette&rsquo;s.
And their face—at first it was just the same dark brown as Finner&rsquo;s,
but then the elf frowned and Finner saw a faint wood grain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are <em>you</em> looking at?&rdquo; the elf asked sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I—sorry, I din&rsquo;t mean to… Um…&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elf&rsquo;s frown deepened.
&ldquo;Let me give you some advice,&rdquo; they said
in a tone that made it clear that what they meant was &ldquo;a warning&rdquo;.
&ldquo;Just because you&rsquo;re still in your original body doesn&rsquo;t make you special,
not on this ship.
The captain doesn&rsquo;t tolerate any &lsquo;real boy&rsquo; nonsense
and neither do the rest of us.
Got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got it! I got it!&rdquo;
Finner raised his hands in apology.</p>
<p>He was just about to start walking again when an alarm began to blare:
<em>murrrp murrrp</em>, pause, <em>murrrp murrrp</em>, pause.
The overhead lights changed from orange to red.
&ldquo;All hands, all hands, battle stations!&rdquo;
a crackly voice ordered through unseen speakers.
&ldquo;Battery teams to firing stations!
Fire suppression teams, suit up!
This is not a drill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Finner shouted, pointing back the way they had come.
Alpha Seven spun around,
and in the moment it took the elf to realize they&rsquo;d been tricked,
Finner ran.</p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m getting pretty good at this,</em> he thought giddily
as he half-slid, half-bounced around a corner.
There!
Door number one oh six, &ldquo;Emerg. Chimney&rdquo;.
He twisted the handle,
pulled it aside,
stubbed his toe on the sill as he stepped through,
and slid the door shut behind him.
<em>Snick!</em>
He hoped that was a lock.
Even more,
he hoped he wouldn&rsquo;t be here long enough to find out if he was right.</p>
<p>The room was even smaller than the one he&rsquo;d woken up in.
There was no furniture and no window,
just a line drawing of a chimney on one whitewashed wall
with a pair of heavy brass dials beside it.
Half a dozen three-letter codes were stencilled on the wall beside it
with a pair of number next to each:
&ldquo;QCD 143.7 22.8&rdquo;,
&ldquo;NAR 96.0 533.5&rdquo;…
The last code was &ldquo;OVB&rdquo;.
The numbers had been crossed out
and the words &ldquo;We miss you Number Five&rdquo; hand-written in their place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;
A heavy fist banged on the door.
&ldquo;Open up!
Open up <em>now</em>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a miiinuuute,&rdquo;
Finner sang.
The codes had to stand for places,
and the numbers had to be how to set the dials to get to them,
but how was he supposed to know where &ldquo;QCD&rdquo; or &ldquo;NAR&rdquo; were
or whether they were safe to go to,
because he was pretty sure &ldquo;OVB&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last chance!&rdquo; Alpha Seven bellowed.
&ldquo;Either you open this door or I zap it open!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner said a word he was pretty sure his parents thought
he still didn&rsquo;t know.<sup id="fnref:word-didnt-know"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:word-didnt-know">55</a></sup>
If he went to any of the places marked on the wall
he&rsquo;d practically be throwing himself into the arms
of some other bunch of elves.
On the other hand,
if he picked a destination at random,
he could wind up on the moon without a spacesuit
or sitting on an ice floe wondering if the cold or Santa Kraken
would get to him first.</p>
<p>His shoulders slumped.
Better to be a prisoner than a meal.
&ldquo;All right, I give up,&rdquo; he said,
or would have if a loud <em>boom!</em> hadn&rsquo;t shaken the airship
hard enough to knock Finner right off his feet.
The whole room—in fact, the whole airship—tilted to one side.</p>
<p>As Finner fell forward
his left hand hit one of the dials.
The light above his head flashed,
or maybe that just a side effect of him stretching in one impossible direction
while the universe stretched around him in another.</p>
<p>A moment later the lock sizzled and evaporated.
Alpha Seven slid the door open,
looked despondently at the empty room,
and used exactly the same word Finner had used moments before.</p>

<h2>Cold That Seeps Into Your Soul</h2>
<p>You have probably been cold at some point in your life.
Maybe you wriggled out from under your blanket as a baby on a chilly night
and weren&rsquo;t yet able to wriggle back underneath it.
Maybe you didn&rsquo;t realize that someone else in the house liked cold showers
and turned on the water <em>while you were already standing underneath the showerhead</em>
and were blasted with the last few seconds of that previous person&rsquo;s liquid self-loathing.
Or perhaps you have had to endure the kind of bone-deep chill of being poor in winter,
of not being able to afford to turn up the heat during the day
or to buy a coat that&rsquo;s thick enough to keep out the wind.
That kind of cold is the worst:
it seeps into your soul as well as your body
because you lose hope of it ever ending.</p>
<p>Thirty seconds after whumping<sup id="fnref:whumping"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:whumping">56</a></sup>
into a snowbank somewhere very Arctic,
Finner felt even colder than that.
The sky above him was an impossibly clear blue
and the sun was so bright he couldn&rsquo;t even look <em>near</em> it,
but each time he took a breath
he could feel the air going into every little corner of his lungs.
Tiny icicles had formed in his nostrils,
and his beard crackled each time he squinted.</p>
<p>The snow squeaked beneath his boots with every step.
Basic survival training is part of every santa&rsquo;s education,
and Finner knew that if he just stood still and shivered,
he wouldn&rsquo;t shiver for long.
He had no idea where he was going,
or even if there was a &ldquo;where&rdquo; to go to,
but he had to keep moving.</p>
<p>He struggled up to the top of yet another shallow ridge
and rubbed his eyes with fingers he could no longer feel properly.
Were there icicles in his eyelashes?
That wasn&rsquo;t important.
What mattered was that the sunlight was reflecting off something up ahead.
Glass, metal, it didn&rsquo;t matter:
as long as it wasn&rsquo;t ice,
it was something to aim for.
He stumbled toward it,
hugging himself to keep in what little body heat he had left.</p>
<p>When he reached the top of the next ridge
he had to stop and rub his eyes again.
An enormous factory sat in the shallow valley in front of him.
It was bigger than any building Finner had ever seen—he
could have stacked ten copies of his school on top of one another
and still not reached its steeply-slanted roof.
Turrets and towers,
windows of all shapes and sizes,
and—</p>
<p>A chill ran up his spine.
A flying saucer was moored against the side of the factory,
bobbing gently up and down in the Arctic breeze.
It was almost as large as the airship he had so recently escaped from,
and its silver underbelly was scratched and scraped from heavy use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not exactly traditional,&rdquo;
a helpful voice said behind him.
&ldquo;But the poor reindeer simply couldn&rsquo;t carry the load any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner turned around slowly.
The person smiling at him was wearing a carefully-patched red coat and a tasselled hat.
Their steel body and cheery painted face
had fewer scratches and scrapes than the flying saucer,
but they were clearly not fresh out of their box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoops,&rdquo; the elf said,
tucking the ray gun that Finner was staring at
back into its holster.
&ldquo;Old habit.
Used to be quite strict around here about security.
Some folks would rather not wait for their presents,
if you take my meaning.&rdquo;
One red electric eye blinked on and off in a wink.
&ldquo;Now, I presume you&rsquo;d be wanting somewhere warm to sit and a nice cup of tea, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hike from the ridge to the factory only took a few minutes,
but as Finner&rsquo;s brain slowly retreated from reality
it seemed to last forever.
First he couldn&rsquo;t feel his toes,
but that had happened before when he had gone out to play in the snow
in his running shoes.
Then his feet went numb,
which made him feel like he was walking on two small sandbags.<sup id="fnref:feet-like-sandbags"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:feet-like-sandbags">57</a></sup>
His ears hurt, then stopped hurting;
his eyelids started sticking together every time he blinked,
and his fingers might as well have been the little breakfast sausages that his father was so fond of.
<em>I wonder if someone will tell them?</em>
he thought blearily,
nodding (or trying to nod) at whatever the elf was saying.</p>
<p>A hand on his arm stopped him.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; the elf repeated gently.
Finner wiped his eyes with his sleeve.
There was a door in front of him,
a perfectly normal door with a little peaked roof over it.
The elf opened it and waved him through.</p>
<p>The mud room on the other side had a boot rack,
a couple of stools with U-shaped seats,
some hooks for hanging coats (all empty),
and a little electric heater
whose cheery orange coils were the most beautiful thing Finner had ever seen.
He stood so close that he could smell the wool of his jacket warming up,
but he didn&rsquo;t care.
He didn&rsquo;t care if it caught fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; the elf said,
nudging a stool underneath him.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see if I can find some tea.
You do drink tea, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yuh-yuh-yuh-&ldquo;</p>
<p>The elf patted his shoulder.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner vaguely noticed the elf open the mud room&rsquo;s other door.
The icicles in his nose and beard and eyebrows were melting.
He wiped his face with his sleeve again
and then tried flexing his fingers.
They still felt like rubbery sausages,
but when he rubbed his hands together
there was at least a little bit of feeling.</p>
<p>He was just about to pull off one of his boots
to see if his feet were still there when the inner door opened again.
The steel-bodied elf who had saved him from freezing to death returned
with a large cup of tea in their hand
and a small dinosaur in a bright blue parka and a black knit cap behind them.</p>
<p>Finner&rsquo;s first thought was, <em>Sure, why not a dinosaur?</em>
His second was, <em>Tea!</em>
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; they said fervently,
taking it from the elf and cradling it in his hands
the way he had seen Gran-Granna Tumbly do so many times.<sup id="fnref:cradle-tea"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:cradle-tea">58</a></sup></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you two a moment,&rdquo; the elf said,
exchanging a nod with the dinosaur
before slipping out of the room again.</p>
<p>The dinosaur shifted the stool with one clawed foot and sat down,
her tail tucked neatly into the &ldquo;U&rdquo; of the seat.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Doctor Sssthzz-eep, but you can call me Doctor E,&rdquo;
the dinosaur said.
&ldquo;And you are…?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Finner,&rdquo; Finner said,
taking a sip of—no,
the tea was still too hot to drink,
but just holding it still felt good.</p>
<p>Doctor E waited a moment,
then nodded briskly.
&ldquo;Right.
Well, Finner, welcome to Castle Base.
The name&rsquo;s a bit dramatic,
if you ask me,
but you elves do like a bit of drama.
Now,
once you&rsquo;re all warmed up we&rsquo;ll give you a once over,
er what?
And a good hearty meal with,
er,
vegetables and what-not,
and then we can have a good long talk
about what enhancements you&rsquo;d like to start with.
I, er, oh, blast.&rdquo;
She patted her parka.
&ldquo;I seem to have left the catalog back in my office.
Forget my own teeth next time,
er what?&rdquo;
She smiled brightly,
showing far more sharp teeth than Finner had seem up close
in almost a whole day.<sup id="fnref:earlier-sharks"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:earlier-sharks">59</a></sup></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Finner said wearily,
&ldquo;I really am,
but I have no idea where I am or who you all are or what you&rsquo;re talking about.
That&rsquo;s been happening a lot lately,&rdquo;
he added as the dinosaur cocked her head to one side.</p>
<p>The dinosaur&rsquo;s tail twitched.
&ldquo;The, er, Rescue Committee?&rdquo;
she suggested.
&ldquo;The emergency chimney you arrived through,
that&rsquo;s one of theirs,
er what?
That&rsquo;s why Abigail was there to, er, to collect you.
Could have been quite chancy if they weren&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
she added,
nodding in agreement with herself.
&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t do at all to have you all popsicled, would it?
Make it rather difficult for you to become an elf, er what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner stared at Doctor E for a moment.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not an elf, I&rsquo;m a santa,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, obviously,
but you&rsquo;re here to <em>become</em> an elf.
Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
she added,
cocking her head to the side once again.</p>
<p>Finner slurped a mouthful of tea.
It was good tea—a bit woody, perhaps,
compared to what he was used to,
but the milk and the slight bitterness of the leaves
set each other off perfectly.</p>
<p>He slurped another mouthful,
took a deep breath,
and let it out.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a <em>santa</em>,&rdquo; he said firmly.
&ldquo;I may not be a particularly good one,
but—&rdquo;
He shrugged,
unsure how to finish the sentence even in his own head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo;
Doctor E said after a moment.
&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s unfortunate.&rdquo;
She stood up,
tugged her parka down,
squared the knit cap on her head,
and then turned her head toward the door and bellowed,
&ldquo;Guards!
Guards, in here!
It seems we have a spy in our midst!&rdquo;</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Santasaurus Rex</h2>
<p>You have probably never been imprisoned.<sup id="fnref:imprisoned-baby"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:imprisoned-baby">60</a></sup>
If you have,
you will understand that after Finner was done protesting
(&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a spy!&rdquo;),
threatening
(&ldquo;People are going to come looking for me, you know—scary people!&rdquo;),
and bargaining
(&ldquo;Look, please just let me talk to whoever&rsquo;s in charge!&rdquo;),
what followed can only be described as boring.</p>
<p>The elf guards who came in answer to Doctor E&rsquo;s call
marched him down a series of corridors,
up a flight of stairs,
past a knot of elves and dinosaurs
who paused their conversation long enough to give him a once-over
before carrying on as if bedraggled santa prisoners were something they saw every day,
and deposited Finner in a room with gray walls,
a padded bench wide enough to double as a bed if you weren&rsquo;t the sort of person who rolled over in their sleep,
and—well,
that was pretty much it.
The door had a small window covered by a hatch on the outside.
There were no windows,
and the only light came from a small bulb set into the ceiling.</p>
<p>Finner didn&rsquo;t bother beating on the door and demanding to be let out.
Instead,
after sitting on the bench for a few moments and thinking about nothing,
he pulled off his boots,
flexed his toes a few times to make sure the pins and needles were gone,
lay down on his back with one arm under his head as a pillow,
and closed his eyes.
He was hungry and he still felt cold,
but since there was nothing he could do about either of those things
he might as well…</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oy, wake up.&rdquo;
He blinked,
then rubbed the gunk from his eyes and tried to focus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You with me, lad?&rdquo; the dinosaur standing over him asked impatiently.
&ldquo;Yeah? Good.
On your feet then.
Himself wants to see you.&rdquo;
The dinosaur&rsquo;s perpetual toothy grin widened slightly.
&ldquo;And you know what happens to folk as keep him waiting, aye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh, not really,&rdquo; Finner yawned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, best you don&rsquo;t find out then, eh?
Now, boots on and hop skip with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More corridors,
more stairs,
more elves and dinosaurs that paid only cursory attention to him
or none at all.
At one point a gangway gave him a glimpse of a workshop
crammed with tables, lathes, drills, saws, and bins of odd parts.<sup id="fnref:no-body-parts"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:no-body-parts">61</a></sup>
It looked like the sort of place that ought to be bustling with activity,
but it was unoccupied except for a lone elf pushing a broom.</p>
<p>They finally reached a pair of double doors three times taller than Finner.
The dinosaur halted.
&ldquo;Well, go on with you,&rdquo; he said,
impatiently but not unkindly,
when Finner did the same.</p>
<p>Finner pushed one door open,
stepped through,
and looked up—<em>way</em> up—at a rusty steel head
that three people could have sat on side by side
and a mouth full of rusty steel teeth as long as his legs.
It was him.
It was Santa Claws,
the one and only santasaurus rex.</p>
<p>He lowered his head slightly,
turning it from side to side to look at Finner
with each of his glowing red eyes in turn.
&ldquo;Mm…&rdquo; he rumbled.
&ldquo;Are you my lunch?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Click.</em>
The door closed behind Finner at precisely the same moment as
his brain made sense of Santa Claws&rsquo; words.
He had just one moment to think,
<em>Well, this is it,</em>
before the giant robot dinosaur laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just teasing.
I don&rsquo;t eat lunch any more—haven&rsquo;t for, oh, feels like forever.
Still enjoy a good battery change, though.
Now,
why don&rsquo;t you have a seat so we can chat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having a seat&rdquo; turned out to mean climbing a ladder
and perching on the top step,
which was only not terrifying because
being face-to-face with a giant robot dinosaur
makes almost everything else seem fairly tame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Santa Claws rumbled,
turning his head to study Finner with one glowing red eye.
&ldquo;Sssthzz-eep says you don&rsquo;t actually want to be enhanced.
I just want you to know that everyone here completely understands.
It&rsquo;s a big step—you can take as long as you want to make up your mind,
and no one will rush you.
Or think any worse of you if you decide to stay a santa,&rdquo;
he added.
&ldquo;Quite a few do, you know—stay santas, I mean.
If tinkering and inventing and what-not are all you want,
you&rsquo;ll have plenty of company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,
but I don&rsquo;t actually know what &lsquo;enhanced&rsquo; means,&rdquo;
Finner admitted cautiously.
&ldquo;I got here kind of by accident, so…&rdquo;
He shrugged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm.&rdquo;
Santa Claws scratched his metal chest absently
with an arm not much bigger than one of Finner&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;But you <em>do</em> like tinkering, don&rsquo;t you?
Clockwork and chemicals and all that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess.
I mean, yes, I do, but…&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;…but your family and friends don&rsquo;t really approve,&rdquo;
Santa Claws finished when Finner fell silent.
&ldquo;They tell you that santas should santa and elves should elf,
and that santas have always run things and that&rsquo;s just how the world&rsquo;s supposed to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes sir.&rdquo;
Finner cleared his throat.
&ldquo;But it <em>is</em> how things have always been, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santa Claws chuckled,
which sounded a bit like a steam locomotive
struggling up a steep hill in Patagonia
on a cold day in May.
&ldquo;Always is a long time.
I started it all, you know—the gifts, I mean.
After the asteroid I got so lonely that
I started making little gifts for other creatures
instead of just eating them.
I still ate some of them sometimes, of course—wouldn&rsquo;t have been
much of a dinosaur if I didn&rsquo;t—but I made little birdhouses for the birds,
and cozy little sweaters to keep the mammals warm during ice ages,
and little floating toys for baby whales to play with.
And when my body started to rust so badly that I couldn&rsquo;t make toys myself,
I made the first elf to help me.
Enhanced Life Form,&rdquo;
he added when Finner opened his mouth.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it stands for,
not that anyone but me remembers.
But I never meant for it all to wind up like this,
with elves being locked up in basements and what-not
and santas giving all the orders
and not knowing a Poynting collector from a collimating manifold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner wasn&rsquo;t about to admit that he had no idea what either of those things were,
so instead he asked,
&ldquo;So what happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santa Claws tilted his head to pick his teeth with one of his claws.
&ldquo;I fell asleep,&rdquo; he admitted.
&ldquo;Thought it would just be a quick nap,
you know,
ten years or so,
but it wound up being a few hundred.
By the time I woke up there were santas all over the multiverse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the double doors creaked open below.
The normal-sized dinosaur who had brought Finner to see Santa Claws
stuck his head in.
&ldquo;Everything all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,
we&rsquo;re getting on famously,&rdquo;
Santa Claws said,
oblivious (or perhaps not) to the thoughts whirling around in Finner&rsquo;s head.
&ldquo;Not a scratch or tooth mark on him, I promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door closed.
&ldquo;So why are you helping the elves?&rdquo;
Finner asked.</p>
<p>Santa Claws sighed.<sup id="fnref:santa-sighed"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:santa-sighed">62</a></sup>
&ldquo;I feel responsible, I suppose.
And I don&rsquo;t think it should matter if you start off a santa or an elf,
you ought to be able to be whatever you most want to be.
I mean,
look at me—carnivore through and through
from a long line of absolute terrors,
and yet here we are,
having a very pleasant conversation without anyone so much as nibbling
on anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you…enhance santas?&rdquo;
Finner ventured cautiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s what they want,&rdquo;
Santa Claws replied
more gently than a giant robotic dinosaur should have been able to.
&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s who they truly are.
And if an elf wants to be a santa,
well,
that&rsquo;s all right too.
Everyone should be able to be who they really are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And suddenly,
without any warning and without knowing why,
Finner realized he was crying.
He wasn&rsquo;t sobbing or making snorkely noises or hiccupping,<sup id="fnref:snorkely-noises"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:snorkely-noises">63</a></sup>
he just had tears on his cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there,&rdquo;
Santa Claws rumbled.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lot, I know.
Why don&rsquo;t I get someone to make you a cup of tea
and get you something to eat?
Or if you&rsquo;d like a bath,
there&rsquo;s lots of hot water.
Geothermal,&rdquo;
he added.
&ldquo;This whole place is built right on top of a dormant volcano.
Well,
mostly dormant, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner wiped his face with his sleeve and nodded.
&ldquo;That would be nice.
Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
Finner didn&rsquo;t see him push a button or ring a bell,
but the door below opened a moment later
and the dinosaur who had brought him stuck his head in again.</p>
<p>Finner turned around cautiously and clambered down the ladder.
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said again.
His tears had stopped as quickly as they&rsquo;d begun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. I just—&rdquo; Santa Claws started,
but Finner never got a chance to find out what he &ldquo;just&rdquo;
as an alarm bell began to ring
and a red light above the door
that I just added to the story because I realized I needed it
began to blink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blast,&rdquo; Santa Claws said calmly.
&ldquo;We appear to be under attack again.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Rescue and Return</h2>
<p>Depending on how you count it,
the next few minutes were the third, fourth, or possibly even fifth time
Finner&rsquo;s life had been in peril in just two days.
A small dinosaur with a brightly-colored ruff of feathers around its neck
hurried Finner along a corridor and up a flight of stairs
as distant explosions went <em>thud!</em> and made the floor shake slightly.
Elves and dinosaurs hurried past,
some carrying laptops and armloads of paper,
others with ray guns of various sizes and shapes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the dinosaur snapped when Finner asked the obvious question.
It pulled yet another door open.
&ldquo;Through here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Arctic sun nearly blinded Finner as he stepped out into the cold.
He stopped and squeezed his eyes shut,
then re-opened them cautiously and squawked.
He and the dinosaur were standing on a metal gangplank
with the battered silver bulk of the flying saucer above them
and the ground a dozen stories below.
There was no handrail—not even a rope to hold onto—but there <em>was</em>
a stiff cross-breeze to make things interesting.</p>
<p><em>BOOM!</em> Another explosion,
closer and not muffled by the castle&rsquo;s walls.
One—two—no, three airships hung side by side in the distance,
puffs of smoke blossoming along their sides as they fired their cannons.
Sizzling bolts of green lanced back in answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; the dinosaur ordered over its shoulder,
sprinting for the flying saucer.
Finner gulped and managed to get a whole two steps
when something slammed into him and he fell screaming to his death.</p>
<p>Or at least that&rsquo;s what he thought would happen
in the moment between being knocked off the gangplank
and a familiar voice triumphantly shouting, &ldquo;Gotcha!&rdquo; in his ear.
Santa Hood whooped as helicopter blades roared to life over their heads
and they shot away toward the attacking airships.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It works every time,&rdquo;
she explained smugly to Finner a few minutes later.
&ldquo;Well, almost.
Come at them loud over here,&rdquo; she wiggled the fingers on one hand,
&ldquo;And while they&rsquo;re distracted,
you sneak in over here.&rdquo;
She waggled one finger on her other hand,
which made the tea in the cup it was holding slosh around a bit.</p>
<p>They were sitting in the tiny mess of the airship she had flown them to.
It was smaller than
the one that had attacked the <em>Dancing Marmot</em>,<sup id="fnref:airship-mess"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:airship-mess">64</a></sup>
and was now headed away from the castle.
As far as Finner had seen,
its crew consisted of Santa Hood and a handful of elves
who ducked their heads as she walked by.
It reminded him uncomfortably
of the way the elves in his parents&rsquo; workshop always stepped aside for him,
and of the fact that he&rsquo;d never really noticed that they did that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how&rsquo;d you find me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Santa Hood sipped her tea.
&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t—Sensei Tumbly did.
After they grabbed you I went back to tell her what had happened,
and…&rdquo;
She shook her head.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen her like that.
She wasn&rsquo;t angry—she was <em>incandescent</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm,&rdquo; Finner said noncommittally.
He had never seen his gran-granna be anything more than annoyed,
but he could imagine.</p>
<p>Santa Hood clicked her teacup into a little ring on the mess table
so that it wouldn&rsquo;t slide around<sup id="fnref:teacup-slide-around"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:teacup-slide-around">65</a></sup>
and cracked her knuckles reflectively.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to make everything even worse,&rdquo; she said bleakly.
&ldquo;Stealing llamas is one thing,
but kidnapping elves—kidnapping <em>family</em>…&rdquo;
She shook her head.
&ldquo;Like I said,
she was past angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>They didn&rsquo;t actually kidnap me,</em> Finner thought but didn&rsquo;t say.
After a few moments where the only sound was the deep thrum of the airship&rsquo;s engines,
Santa Hood cleared her throat and stood up.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have you home in a few hours.
Can&rsquo;t offer you a bathtub or a shower,
but there&rsquo;s hot water and towels and a bunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The towels were mismatched—Finner assumed Santa Hood had stolen them—but
the water was hot and the narrow fold-down bunk that one of the elves led him to
was surprisingly comfortable.
&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo;
he said as the elf turned to leave,
&ldquo;But can I ask you a question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, santa,&rdquo; the elf said,
their eyes on the deck.</p>
<p>Finner hesitated.
&ldquo;How long have you worked for Santa Hood?&rdquo; he asked,</p>
<p>&ldquo;First time, santa,&rdquo; the elf replied.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m one of General Tumbly&rsquo;s.
Will there be anything else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um, no, that&rsquo;s everything,&rdquo; Finner said,
wishing a moment too late that he&rsquo;d added,
&ldquo;And please don&rsquo;t call me &lsquo;santa&rsquo;.
I&rsquo;m just Finner,&rdquo;
but by then the elf had slid the cabin door shut behind them.</p>
<p>He eventually fell asleep.</p>
<p>A brisk knock on the cabin door woke him.
&ldquo;Welcome home,&rdquo; Santa Hood said briskly as she slid the door open.
&ldquo;We just did our last chimney—we&rsquo;re back in your world now.
It&rsquo;s about…&rdquo;
She pulled up her sleeve and studied a wristwatch with half a dozen hands,
her lips moving for a moment.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s about tea time, actually.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner looked down through one of the oversized windows in the airship&rsquo;s cockpit
as farms slowly gave way to houses with big backyard gardens,
which in turn gave way to older, taller houses standing shoulder to shoulder
along cobblestoned streets that sparkled with frost under the morning sun.
A few patches of snow huddled in shadowed corners
and under the branches of the evergreens in an L-shaped park
that Finner suddenly realized he had played in when he was younger.</p>
<p>He swallowed the lump in his throat.
&ldquo;Th-that&rsquo;s my house,&rdquo; he said shakily, pointing at a slate-gray roof
no different from any of those beside it
except for how it made him feel.</p>
<p>Santa Hood grinned.
&ldquo;Yes it is.&rdquo;
Her grin slipped a bit.
&ldquo;Have to take you to Sensei Tumbly&rsquo;s first, though.
She&rsquo;s going to have questions,
and I expect she&rsquo;s not in the mood to wait for answers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like most neighborhoods in town,
Finner&rsquo;s had a gangly airship docking tower
that was mostly used for furniture deliveries and house removals.
He&rsquo;d only been up to the top once,
on a school trip that consisted of flying in a big circle around town
under drizzling clouds
while the teacher tried to sound excited about industry and urban planning.
The little waiting room seemed both larger and smaller than he remembered:
larger because it wasn&rsquo;t packed with two dozen young santas,
and smaller because—actually,
he was grateful that he didn&rsquo;t have time to puzzle that out
at that exact moment.</p>
<p>He and Santa Hood rode the elevator down in silence.
A tricycle taxi was waiting for them.
Its driver nodded to Santa Hood and began pedalling
without having to ask where they were going.</p>
<p>Gran-Granna Tumbly&rsquo;s house looked exactly as it had just a couple of days before
except for the scorch marks from the elves ray guns,
the steel shutters over the windows,
and the fact that the stone cat on the pedestal out front
had been replaced by something that looked like an orangutan with four arms,
each holding a different kind of sword or club.
Its head swivelled menacingly to follow Santa Hood and Finner
as they walked up to the front door,
but other than that it was motionless.</p>
<p>Santa Hood knocked three times,
paused,
knocked three times again,
paused a second time,
and then rapped her knuckles on the door one last time.
Catching Finner&rsquo;s eye, she grinned.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not actually a secret code,&rdquo;
she whispered loudly.
&ldquo;But if anyone&rsquo;s watching, they won&rsquo;t know that.
Clever, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door swung open with a Halloween creak
before Finner could answer.
He swallowed hard and followed Santa Hood into the house.</p>
<p>The carpet in the hall looked just like it always had.
So did the gargoyle coathooks and the over-stuffed chairs in the sitting room,
but the plants were gone.
In their place stood a large table covered in maps—maps of cities,
continents,
and solar systems,
with floor plans and aerial photographs scattered among them
like coins tossed into a fountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dislike mess at the best of times,&rdquo;
Gran-Granna said from behind them,
&ldquo;And these aren&rsquo;t the best of times.&rdquo;
She strode past him,
picked up a green-and-white teacup perched on the corner of the table,
and scowled at the confusion in front of her.</p>
<p>Finner glanced at Santa Hood,
hoping for  clue to what he was supposed to do or say,
but her eyes were on the table as well.
Just as he opened his mouth to speak,
Gran-Granna Tumbly turned around.
She had a patch over one eye and fresh stiches on her cheek,
but what <em>really</em> startled Finner was the sturdy-looking pistol in her hand,
which was pointed at his chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; she said conversationally.
&ldquo;How about you start by telling me who you really are
and what you&rsquo;ve done with my grand-grandson?&rdquo;</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>It Doesn&rsquo;t <em>Feel</em> Normal</h2>
<p>If you have led a quiet life—a life in which
it is relatively rare for people to point firearms of any kind at one another—you
will probably find it hard to believe that
having firearms pointed at you can become a little bit boring
if it happens often enough.
It&rsquo;s rather like living in a house next to a railway line or a spaceport:
the first few nights,
you wake up every time a train goes by or a rocket blasts into orbit,
but then your brain gets used to it and says,
&ldquo;Meh,&rdquo;
and lets you get a good night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>That said,
it does depend on the firearm and on who&rsquo;s doing the pointing.
Something that looks like it was designed to make holes in steel plate
is pretty hard for a brain to &ldquo;meh&rdquo;,
and if the pointer is the kind of little old lady
who looks as though she could chew a hole in that same piece of steel if she wanted to,
your brain is far more likely to go &ldquo;meep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner&rsquo;s hands put themselves up,
just as they had when Santa Hood had pointed the ray gun at him
on board the <em>Dancing Marmot</em>.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Finner!&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Finner Tumbly!
I&rsquo;m your gran-grandson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pistol didn&rsquo;t waver.
&ldquo;Ask me something,&rdquo; Finner said desperately.
&ldquo;Something only I would know.
Like—like that picture!&rdquo;
He pointed at a crayon drawing in a frame on the wall.
&ldquo;My dad drew that when he was little,
and you used to have it on your refrigerator,
but he took it and had one of the elves frame it
so he could give it to you a second time,
only my mum says you would rather he hadn&rsquo;t
because it doesn&rsquo;t go with anything else in the room
and you think it was better off on the fridge.
See?
I&rsquo;m <em>Finner</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gran-Granna Tumbly&rsquo;s jaw tightened.
&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; she hissed.
&ldquo;First faces, then memories.
Do you see what we&rsquo;re up against, Periwinkle?
Do you see it now?&rdquo;
She cocked her gun with a very loud <em>click</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sensei, wait! Wait!&rdquo;
Santa Hood raised one hand.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying you&rsquo;re wrong,
but—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But nothing!&rdquo; Gran-Granna Tumbly raged.
&ldquo;You saw it—you saw him fire one of their ray guns.
You know as well as I do that only elves can use them.
And he was in that castle of theirs for <em>hours</em>,&rdquo;
she added darkly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then he must have been an elf all along,&rdquo;
Santa Hood retorted,
&ldquo;Because he wasn&rsquo;t out of my sight
from the time Greenwood and I came through your chimney
until—well, all those things you just said,&rdquo;
she finished relcutantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does everyone keep telling me I&rsquo;m an elf?&rdquo; Finner demanded,
lowering his hands because his arms were getting tired
and also because having them up
didn&rsquo;t feel like it was making any difference to his odds of survival.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a santa.
Look, I have a beard—&rdquo;
he pointed at the wisps of hair on his chin
&ldquo;—and,
and I won a prize for being the best in my class at ho-ho-hoing last year,
and yeah,
okay,
I&rsquo;ve never delivered a cake to a bunch of scientists in a submarine,
but <em>I&rsquo;m a santa.</em>&ldquo;</p>
<p>Gran-Granna Tumbly didn&rsquo;t take her eyes off her grandson
as she reached over and tapped the top of a china armadillo
on the mantelpiece next to her.
&ldquo;I like the ho-ho-ho&rsquo;ing,
but deliveries are—&rdquo;
Finner&rsquo;s voice from two days ago paused for breath.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like everyone else is excited about it but I&rsquo;m just watching myself do it,
you know?
Like this is someone else&rsquo;s life and I&rsquo;ve just put it on like a sweater
except it doesn&rsquo;t quite fit
and no matter how many times I wash it,
it&rsquo;ll still smell a bit like whoever it really belongs to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You—you <em>recorded</em> me?&rdquo; Finner said incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like I said,
your folks have been worried about you for a while.&rdquo;
She grimaced.
&ldquo;Seems like every problem winds up in my living room sooner or later.
So which is it?
Are you just watching yourself or <em>are</em>… <em>you</em>… a <em>santa</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked her in the eye.
&ldquo;Ho ho ho,&rdquo; he said flatly.</p>
<p>Beside him, Santa Hood caught her breath.
For one moment he thought Gran-Granna Tumbly might actually use her pistol,
but then she thumbed the safety catch and set it down on the table beside her.
&ldquo;Right then.
Have a seat and tell me <em>everything</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything&rdquo; took about an hour.<sup id="fnref:everything-hour"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:everything-hour">66</a></sup>
She scowled when the elves attacked Santa Hotep&rsquo;s pyramid,
smacked the table with the palm of her hand a couple of times
during the bit with the sharks,
and made him repeat his story of firing the ray gun three times.
She was less interested than he had expected she would be
in his time aboard the elves&rsquo; airship.
&ldquo;Of course it was Alpha One,&rdquo; she muttered,
gesturing for him to continue
without giving him a chance to ask
why the elf had looked exactly like her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me more about the chimneys,&rdquo;
she said.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure the first one was &lsquo;QCD&rsquo;?
Yes?
I don&rsquo;t suppose you can remember
the exact squiggle factors they used for it?
The numbers beside the chimney code,&rdquo;
she explained impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, no,&rdquo; Finner said,
looking down into his tea.</p>
<p>Gran-Granna Tumbly looked at Santa Hood,
who raised her hands apologetically.
&ldquo;We cleaned it out!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;You saw the pictures, sensei—there wasn&rsquo;t enough left to wrap a lollipop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,
it looks like we&rsquo;re going to have to do it again,&rdquo;
Gran-Granna Tumbly said,
in a tone that made it completely unnecessary to add,
&ldquo;And this time it will <em>stay</em> clean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if on cute,
the FAOT<sup id="fnref:faot"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:faot">67</a></sup>
cleared its throat behind Finner.
&ldquo;The young santa&rsquo;s taxi is here,&rdquo; it announced.</p>
<p>Gran-Granna Tumbly nodded.
&ldquo;Your parents have been very worried,&rdquo; she told Finner
in a tone that made it equally unnecessary to add,
&ldquo;And have been pestering me endlessly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said automatically.
&ldquo;Um,
you&rsquo;d be very welcome to, um,&rdquo; he added to Santa Hood,
who shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll want some time with you,&rdquo;
she said gently.
&ldquo;And it look like sensei and I have a raid to plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the thing about parents:
they are the most important people in your life when you&rsquo;re growing up,
but can also be the most annoying.
Sometimes it&rsquo;s deliberate,
like when they share your baby pictures with your friends just to make you squirm
or,
if their parents were cruel to them and they haven&rsquo;t learned any better since,
when they keep making jokes about your haircut long after you&rsquo;re in tears.
Mostly,
though,
parents are annoying because you think you&rsquo;re ready to be a grownup and they don&rsquo;t agree,
or do but aren&rsquo;t ready to let you go.</p>
<p>Going to your gran-granna&rsquo;s for a cup of tea and not coming home for two whole days
pretty much guarantees annoying parental behavior,
especially if the parents in question have been told that
you spent those two days being chased across parallel dimensions
by a band of murderous elves.
When they ask if you&rsquo;re all right,
what they really mean is that they were scared.<sup id="fnref:they-were-scared"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:they-were-scared">68</a></sup>
And when they fuss over you and tell you everything&rsquo;s all right now,
they&rsquo;re trying to convince themselves as much as you.</p>
<p>We are therefore going to skip over the next few hours of Finner&rsquo;s life,
and most of the week that followed.
His dad baked three batches of his favorite cookies<sup id="fnref:chili-lime"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:chili-lime">69</a></sup>
while his mum kept checking that he was warm enough.
His classmates crowded around him and asked what had happened
and whether it was true that he&rsquo;d been in an airship battle
and did he have any cool new scars to show off.
He mostly mumbled in response,
uncomfortable at suddenly being the center of attention
instead of in his usual place on the edge of the crowd
trying to figure out what the cool kids were up to.</p>
<p>People eventually got tired of, &ldquo;Yeah, something like that,&rdquo;
and went back to their usual gossip.
His writing teacher took him aside and said that
if he wanted to try expressing what had happened to him in a poem,
she would be happy to give him extra credit for it.
A vague, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think about it,&rdquo; was apparently not the right answer,
but he honestly didn&rsquo;t know what to say.
The santas, the elves, the pyramids and the airship and the <em>Dancing Marmot</em>
and the castle in the Arctic—it already felt like it had happened to someone else.</p>
<p>And besides,
he had other things to think about.
He couldn&rsquo;t stop noticing
how the elves in his parents&rsquo; basement ducked their heads and went quiet
whenever there was a santa around,
or how they always asked permission before going out on an errand
even though some of them were almost as old as Gran-Granna Tumbly.
He couldn&rsquo;t stop wondering why they only made deliveries once a year.
Didn&rsquo;t people need things on the other 364 days?</p>
<p>He kept those thoughts to himself.
And he was very, <em>very</em> careful not to let anyone know
about the odds and ends he smuggled into his bedroom.
A rusty pair of scissors that he spotted near a bus stop on his way home from school.
A ball of string that he slipped into his pocket during science class.
Some paper—not writing paper, but construction paper
that had to be folded carefully and then creased twice to make a straight seam,
but oh,
what a beautiful seam it was—and best of all,
a roll of tape with only a little bit of lint stuck to it
that he fished out of a box that one of the elves was packing up
when the elf went downstairs to get another armload of glass flowers.</p>
<p>Finner felt terrible as he listened to muffled voices coming from the basement,
one demanding where the tape had gone
and the other protesting that they didn&rsquo;t know,
but he couldn&rsquo;t stop himself.
He needed to make things.
No, he <em>needed</em> to make things,
the same way that he needed to breathe after holding his breath under water
for as long as he could.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s skip ahead a week to the moment when
Finner&rsquo;s mum opened his bedroom door
to tell him that his dad had made another batch of cookies
and found her son sitting on the floor
taping carefully-folded bits of paper together
to make a tiny cardboard dinosaur.
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she gasped,
her hand flying to her mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mum! You&rsquo;re supposed to knock!&rdquo;
Finner exclaimed as he tried to sweep his craft supplies under his bed.
As his mum thundered down the stairs,
calling for his dad,
his stomach flip-flopped.
He heard voices,
first questioning and then angry,
and then his dad saying,
&ldquo;All right. All right!
Let&rsquo;s call your grandmother.
She&rsquo;ll know what to do.&rdquo;</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>The Building</h2>
<p>Nobody called The Building a prison except the people who weren&rsquo;t allowed to leave.
The staff sometimes used the word &ldquo;hospital&rdquo;,
but for the most part they stuck to euphemisms like &ldquo;reorientation center&rdquo;
or &ldquo;a place where you can get back in touch with your inner santa&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And the daily activities weren&rsquo;t mandatory, either.
In fact,
they were so <em>not</em> mandatory that sometimes Finner wanted to scream.
&ldquo;Are you <em>sure</em> you don&rsquo;t want to do a little ho-ho-ho&rsquo;ing?
Everyone else will be there.&rdquo;
If he had been at home or at school and said, &ldquo;No thank you,&rdquo;
the person asking might have pressed him once or twice
but would eventually have taken the hint.
Not at The Building, though.
There,
&ldquo;no thank you&rdquo; produced an endless sequence of, &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;
and, &ldquo;How about you just give it a try?&rdquo;
and, &ldquo;Oh come on, Mister Frowny, it will put a smile on your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That last comment actually did make him smile a little,
but only because of the way Zubi said it.
They were one of the other guests,<sup id="fnref:p-word"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:p-word">70</a></sup>
and claimed to have come from a world where everyone was a santa.
Or where santas didn&rsquo;t need chimneys
because they could just imagine themselves wherever they wanted.
Or where santas pulled sleighs and reindeer handed out presents.
Their story changed every time they told it,
but Finner didn&rsquo;t mind.
It was more entertaining than the jingly movies
that played on repeat in the dining hall,
none of which involved ray guns
or santas wondering if they were really elves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we break out—&rdquo;
Zubi paused for a moment to chew a particularly tough piece of jello.
They raised a finger,
swallowed hard,
and stuck out a green tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we break out,&rdquo;
they continued,
setting aside the rest of the jello,
&ldquo;The first thing I&rsquo;m going to make is a bicycle.
A real bicycle, not a toy one,
and I&rsquo;m going to ride it aaall over town.
What about you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner shrugged.
He had taken a mince pie for dessert instead of a bowl of jello,
but the first mouthful had tasted of nothing at all,
so he set it aside too.
&ldquo;I dunno.
Figure it out when I get there, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were only half a dozen other young santas in the dining hall that evening.
Four of them sat together,
grimly enjoying a complicated game of cards.
The other two sat at the same table
but did their best to ignore each other.
Finner assumed that they would have preferred to sit by themselves,
but as he had found out the hard way,
it would only be about ninety seconds until one of the staff showed up
and encouraged you to be more social.
And while throwing food at them was briefly satisfying,
it only made them heartier.
One of them had actually started caroling
as she mopped his chili off her coat,
as if being splattered with beans and sauce somehow proved her right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I liked wind-up trains,&rdquo; she had confided afterward.
Finner would rather have been anywhere else<sup id="fnref:even-volcano"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:even-volcano">71</a></sup>
than across the table from her,
but there was no way to go.
&ldquo;I liked how the coilspring tightened as I turned the key,
and the little clicking sound the refurgent gear made on tight corners,
and…&rdquo;
She had sighed theatrically.
&ldquo;But then I realized—that&rsquo;s not who I am.
I&rsquo;m a santa.
I deliver things, I don&rsquo;t make them.
And I know how confused you feel right now,
truly I do,
but you&rsquo;re a santa too.
You just need a little help realizing it.&rdquo;
And then she had patted his hand and walked away,
caroling softly to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, where&rsquo;d you go?&rdquo;
Zubi prodded the back of Finner&rsquo;s hand with their fork.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just thinking,&rdquo; he mumbled.</p>
<p>Zubi grinned and leaned forward.
&ldquo;About an escape plan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About whether they&rsquo;ll let me sleep in if I say I&rsquo;m not feeling well.&rdquo;
Finner stacked his dishes on his tray and stood up.
&ldquo;See you tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His bedroom didn&rsquo;t have bars on the windows,
but those windows didn&rsquo;t open either.
He lay back with his hands behind his head
and stared at sleigh-and-reindeer mobile hanging from the ceiling.</p>
<p>And blinked.</p>
<p>And rolled his head gently from side to side
as if working a kink out of his neck.
Yup,
there was definitely something under his pillow.
He yawned,
stretched,
and rolled over on his side
so that he could slide his hand up to check it out.
His fingers closed around a piece of metal about the size of his thumb.</p>
<p>His breath caught in his throat as he turned it over.
It felt like a key.
In fact,
it felt exactly like one of the keys that the staff used
to unlock The Building&rsquo;s many doors.</p>
<p><em>Great,</em> he thought tiredly.
He stood up with the key in his hand
and tucked his feet into his slippers one by one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did someone lose this?&rdquo; he asked a moment later,
holding the key out
for the santa behind the desk to inspect.
He had an eyepatch,
but looked more like someone who had been clumsy with a broom
than like a pirate.</p>
<p>The santa cleared his throat.
&ldquo;Oh, yes, dear me, I think that <em>is</em> one of ours,&rdquo; he said brightly.
&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome,&rdquo; Finner said automatically.
It was the third time since he&rsquo;d arrived
that someone had &ldquo;lost&rdquo; a key where he would find it.
He had no doubt that if he tried to use it,
a couple of burly santas would be waiting on the other side
of whatever door he opened,
but at least it was subtler<sup id="fnref:subtler-and-safer"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:subtler-and-safer">72</a></sup>
than the hacksaw someone had put in his underwear drawer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, and there&rsquo;s a letter for you,&rdquo;
the desk santa added,
rummaging around for a moment
before handing Finner a square brown envelope
covered in a confetti explosion of interdimensional stamps.
Someone had carefully blacked out the address below Finner&rsquo;s name,
but careful blocky letters in the corner spelled out
&ldquo;S. Greenwood, Isla del Tesoro&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He took the letter back to his room
and lay down once again with the letter on his chest.
One of the toy reinder in the mobile hanging from the ceiling
was missing a hoof.
You could study the mobile for hours and not notice it,
but once he had,
he couldn&rsquo;t stop wondering how it had happened.
Had someone forgotten to attach it when the mobile was made?
Had it come off when the mobile was hung
and been vacuumed up and thrown away before anyone noticed?
Or was it a deliberate mistake,
like the mis-tied knots weavers put in rugs
to show that they&rsquo;d been made by hand?<sup id="fnref:bad-knots"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:bad-knots">73</a></sup>
Or was it a test?
Was the staff watching to see if he just couldn&rsquo;t stop himself from fixing it?</p>
<p>He shook his head.
He was starting to think like Zubi,
which meant it was time to think about something else.
He held up the letter,
turned it over to admire the stamps on the back,
and tore it open.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Finner,</p>
<p>I heard you got home but are having more trouble.
Just wanted you to know that
it took me and my dad a while to figure things out
after I told him that I wanted to be with the trees
instead of sailing and pirating and all that.
I even spent a few days where you are now
but then he came and got me and we had a good talk.
We still argue sometimes
and he&rsquo;s never going to enjoy being in the forest
instead of on the ocean
but he wears the peg leg I made for him
and tells my friends his dumb jokes
and that&rsquo;s good enough for me.</p>
<p>I hope you find your forest too.</p>
<p>Your friend,</p>
<p>Steve (Santa Greenwood)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finner wiped his eyes with his sleeve
and folded the letter to tuck it back into the envelope.
And stopped.
And slowly,
looking up at the mobile rather than at the stiff cardboard in his hands,
used his finger to tear open the sides of the envelope
so that he could unfold it.</p>
<p>Faint silver lines reflected the light
when he tilted the envelope at the right angle.
One side showed a map of The Building
with the dining hall,
the dormitories,
and a dotted line showing how to get into the laundry room in the basement
and then out through a ventilation shaft.
The other side showed the gardens around The Building,
including a pond with a carefully drawn crocodile grinning in its center.</p>
<p>A small X marked a spot on the fence.
Next to it was one word: &ldquo;Midnight.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:midnight-note"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:midnight-note">74</a></sup></p>
<p>Finner tucked the letter into the torn envelope
and slid it under his pillow.
The cheerful santa clock on the wall told him it was half past seven.
Was the letter real or was it a trap?
There was only one way to find out.</p>

<h2>Not All Bars Are On Windows</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Psst!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Psst! Zubi! Wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mmph? Uzzat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zubi! Come on, wake up, wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh mibble. Uh sleebig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, you&rsquo;re not sleeping.
You have to wake up.
We&rsquo;re getting out of here.
We&rsquo;re getting out of here <em>now</em>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s me.
Listen,
you have to wake up.
I got a letter, and—wait.
I&rsquo;ll be back in a sec.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nng? Finner, is that you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Finner, are you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ssh!
Keep it down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Finner, where&rsquo;d you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the staff just went by.
I had to hide under the credenza, and—listen,
that&rsquo;s not important right now.
I know a way out, Zubi.
At least I think I do,
but it&rsquo;s almost midnight—we have to go <em>now</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;…&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Psst!
Zubi!
Oh,
come on,
don&rsquo;t go back to sleep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t.
I&rsquo;m right here.
What do you mean, you know a way out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know a way out of here,
but we have to get moving.
Get some clothes on and let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;…&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zubi!
Come on!
The staff could be back any moment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go ahead.
I&rsquo;m staying here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?
Zubi, come on!
I know it&rsquo;s scary, but this could be our only shot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not scared, Finner, I just don&rsquo;t want to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;…what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go.
I don&rsquo;t want to be here any more than you do,
but—listen, you should go.
You should go right now, okay?
And, you know, good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait.
Zubi,
just wait a second.
I thought you hated this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, but—look,
I don&rsquo;t know what kind of santa I&rsquo;m supposed to be,
but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m an elf, all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zubi…I thought… You said you wanted to make bicycles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, well, I say a lot of things.
You ought to know better by now than to take me seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what,
you&rsquo;re just going to spend the rest of your life chewing jello
and watching the same stupid movies over and over again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.
Maybe if I chew enough jello they&rsquo;ll make me one of the staff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come on, Zubi, don&rsquo;t say that.
Don&rsquo;t say that.
Come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey—are you crying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!
I just—uh oh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finner?
Hey, Finner, are you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Psst! Finner, are you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey—Finner.
Good luck, okay?
I hope—whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santa Greenwood was waiting exactly where his map said he could be,
hidden among the trees outside the fence.
He wrinkled his nose when Finner came close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a <em>sanitation</em> shaft, not a ventilation shaft,&rdquo; Finner explained,
plucking at the odoriferous clothes sticking damply to his skin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a pond right over there.&rdquo;
Santa Greenwood nodded to his left.
Something large and toothy swished through the water as if in response.
&ldquo;All right, never mind.
Can&rsquo;t be any worse than when the llamas get into the candy canes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fence wasn&rsquo;t electrified—after all,
The Building wasn&rsquo;t a prison—but it was quite high
and topped with spikes &ldquo;to keep the pigeons off&rdquo;.
Santa Greenwood solved that problem by putting on a heavy pair of gloves,
bracing his legs,
grabbing hold of the chain mesh,
and pulling it out of the ground with one might heave.
Finner scraped underneath<sup id="fnref:scraped-underneath"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:scraped-underneath">75</a></sup>
and scrambled back to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Definitely worse than the llamas,&rdquo;
Santa Hood said drily,
stepping out of the shadows behind Santa Greenwood.</p>
<p>Finner goggled at her.
She shrugged.
&ldquo;What?
You didn&rsquo;t think he came up with this plan all on his own, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner spread his hands.
&ldquo;Why are you both even here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santa Greenwood glanced at Santa Hood.
&ldquo;Thought Sensei Tumbly might have made a mistake,&rdquo;
she said,
not meeting his eyes.
&ldquo;Figured we should check in on you ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner looked up at the sky.
The moon was half full, or maybe half empty—he didn&rsquo;t know enough
to be able to tell the two apart.
He could see a few stars,
but silvery clouds hid the others.
A light breeze rustled the leaves on the trees behind the two santas.
He took a deep breath,
held it a moment,
and let it out,
savoring the absence of the cinnamon hot chocolate smell that pervaded The Building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no mistake,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an elf,
or at least I think I am.
I don&rsquo;t know what that means yet,
but I hope it doesn&rsquo;t mean we have to be on opposite sides of…
Ooph!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grunted as Santa Greenwood picked him up,
squeezed him,
and set him back down.
Santa Hood looked back and forth between them,
then sighed and punched his shoulder.
&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Escape&rsquo;s not over &lsquo;til you&rsquo;ve had a bath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This escape is over now,&rdquo;
a cold voice said.
Santa Hood and Santa Greenwood whirled around
as Gran-Granna Tumbly stepped out of the trees behind them
with half a dozen other santas behind her.
No,
not santas,
Finner realized: robo-santas with fake beards
and white plastic smiles
and thuddy things in their hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sensei—&rdquo; Santa Hood began.</p>
<p>Gran-Granna Tumbly raised a hand to cut her off.
&ldquo;I am very disappointed in you,&rdquo; she hissed.
&ldquo;You have been very, <em>very</em> naughty.
And you!&rdquo;
She jabbed a finger at Santa Greenwood.
&ldquo;What will your father say when he finds out, hm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santa Greenwood reached over his shoulder for his ax
and grinned the kind of grin
that would make even the most experienced lumberjack
think about becoming a cheesewright instead.
&ldquo;He would say <em>now, Periwinkle, now!</em>&ldquo;</p>
<p>Roots burst out of the earth beneath the robo-santas
and twisted around their metal legs.
With a bellow that would have made any pirate proud,
Santa Greenwood charged forward with his ax held high.</p>
<p>And promptly sprawled face-first in the dirt
as Gran-Granna Tumbly flicked her cane between his ankles.
Santa Greenwood scrambled to his feet,
grabbed his ax,
and promptly went down again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I guess we&rsquo;re doing this,&rdquo;
Santa Hood muttered beside Finner,
drawing a slender sword with a blackened blade from her sack
and tossing it aside.
Gran-Granna Tumbly scowled,
twisted the head of her cane,
and drew the sparkly rapier Finner had last seen when the elves had attacked her house.
It didn&rsquo;t seem particularly magical any longer.
It just looked dangerous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what you can do about those robots, will you?&rdquo;
Santa Hood said,
settling into a wide-legged stance
as Gran-Granna Tumbly rocked her head from side to side to crack her neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What exactly do you want me to do?&rdquo;
Finner didn&rsquo;t ask,
because he had now been in enough battles to know that
there&rsquo;s a time for asking and there&rsquo;s a time for doing,
and if your great-grandmother and the santa who was trying to rescue you
had just started trading cuts and jabs and blocks,
it wasn&rsquo;t the time for asking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang on, Periwinkle, I&rsquo;ll—would you stop doing that!?&rdquo;
Santa Greenwood actually made it to his feet this time
before a kick to the back of one knee put him back on the ground.
Gran-Granna Tumbly hadn&rsquo;t even glanced at him.
All her attention was on Santa Hood.</p>
<p>Finner snatched Santa Greenwood&rsquo;s ax off the ground
and brought it up in a wild parry
just as one of the robo-santas swung a padded club at his head.
The robot managed a second step before a fresh crop of roots
wound themselves around its legs.</p>
<p><em>We&rsquo;re going to lose,</em> Finner realized.
Gran-Granna Tumbly was more than a match for Santa Greenwood and Santa Hood together,
and sooner or later the trees were going to run out of roots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catch!&rdquo; he shouted,
tossing Santa Greenwood&rsquo;s ax back to him
and grabbing Santa Hood&rsquo;s sack.
He thrust his arm into it,
pulled out the first thing he found,
and threw it at Gran-Granna Tumbly.</p>
<p><em>Flick!</em>
Gran-Granna Tumbly knocked the bath duck aside with her sword.
&ldquo;Hey, that&rsquo;s mine!&rdquo; Santa Greenwood shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to give it back!&rdquo;
Santa Hood shouted back,
frantically parrying a sudden flurry of attacks from Gran-Granna Tumbly.</p>
<p>A frisbee.
A toy goat that bleated pitifully as it hit the ground.
A pair of brightly-patterned socks
that Finner would have looked at more closely under other circumstances.
Another second frisbee.
&ldquo;Where are the grenades?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the left!&rdquo;
Santa Hood shouted back.
&ldquo;No, not your left, the sack&rsquo;s left!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner thrust his arm into the sack as deep as it would go.
His fingers closed on something rectangular.
It was a remote control like the one for his family&rsquo;s refrigerator.<sup id="fnref:fridge-remote"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:fridge-remote">76</a></sup>
He whirled around just as another robo-santa pulled its legs free from the tree roots
and pointed the remote at it,
clicking buttons with his thumb.</p>
<p><em>Bzzt!</em>
The robo-santa froze.
<em>All</em> the robots froze,
and then turned their heads in unison to look straight at Gran-Granna Tumbly.
&ldquo;Safety protocols deactivated,&rdquo; they said in unison.
&ldquo;Resuming primary mode.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gran-Granna Tumbly&rsquo;s eyes widened.
&ldquo;Oh, you idiot boy,&rdquo; she snapped.
&ldquo;What have you done now?&rdquo;
But Finner barely heard her.
He was too busy being terrified as the robo-santas dropped their padded clubs
and retracted their hands into their arms,
sprouting chainsaws and flamethrowers in their place.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>The Recording</h2>
<p>Finner managed to push two more buttons,
with no visible effect,
before throwing it one way and himself another
to avoid a jet of flame from one of the robo-santas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their control circuits are in their heads!&rdquo;
Gran-Granna Tumbly barked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know where their control circuits are!&rdquo;
Santa Hood snapped back.
The two had just a second to glare at each other
before the robo-santas were on them.
Their swords flashed in the moonlight.
Sparks flew every time they knocked aside a chainsaw.
Santa Hood ducked, dodged, and whirled,
never still.
Gran-Granna Tumbly—Finner wasn&rsquo;t sure what she was doing,
but somehow she just happened to never be in the way
of a swinging chainsaw or a burst of flame.</p>
<p>And then Santa Greenwood charged into the fight.
<em>Clang!</em>
A single mighty swing of his ax sent one robo-santa&rsquo;s head flying.
&ldquo;The trees, lad!&rdquo; he yelled at Finner.
&ldquo;Get to the trees!&rdquo;
He swung his ax again and swore mightily
as a lucky shot from a robo-santa set his beard on fire.</p>
<p>Finner sprinted half a dozen steps and pulled up short.
No.
No, he wasn&rsquo;t going to run away.
He didn&rsquo;t have a ray gun or a sword or an ax,
but—he dodged sideways to avoid Santa Greenwood&rsquo;s backswing—but
what he <em>did</em> have was two free hands and an idea.
He threw himself full-length on the grass,
grabbed the remote,
rolled over,
and pointed it at the nearest robot.</p>
<p><em>Click!</em>
<em>Click!</em>
<em>Click!</em>
&ldquo;Come on, <em>do</em> something!&rdquo; he muttered.
<em>Click!</em>
<em>Click!</em></p>
<p>The robo-santa froze.
&ldquo;AAAAHHH!&rdquo;
Santa Greenwood swung his ax.
<em>Clang!</em>
The robot&rsquo;s head went flying.</p>
<p>Four robots versus three santas (one with a smoldering beard) and Finner.
<em>Clang clang zzzt!</em>
Gran-Granna&rsquo;s rapier scraped along one of the robot&rsquo;s arms
and into the joint where its head met its shoulders.
The robot&rsquo;s eyes flared and went dark.</p>
<p><em>Click!</em>
<em>Click!</em>
Another robo-santa froze.
&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Finner shouted.
This time it was Santa Hood&rsquo;s blade that found an opening and—</p>
<p>—and her eyes widened in shock
as Gran-Granna Tumbly pivoted and ran her through.
&ldquo;Periwinkle!&rdquo; Santa Greenwood bellowed in anguish
as his friend fell to her knees,
her sword dropping from her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Finner shouted,
but then the flat of Gran-Granna Tumbly&rsquo;s sword struck the side of his head.
He crumpled to the ground.</p>
<p>Gran-Granna Tumbly oophed as she bent over to pluck the remote from his hand.
Three quick clicks and the robo-santas were at her side.
&ldquo;You can save your friend or you can come after me,
but you can&rsquo;t do both,&rdquo;
she told Santa Greenwood,
backing away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sensei…&rdquo;
Santa Hood pleaded weakly.</p>
<p>Gran-Granna Tumbly looked at her coldly.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever call me that again.&rdquo;
And then she and the robo-santas were gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Finner said,
kneeling beside Santa Hood.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She coughed wetly.
&ldquo;Not…your fault.
You didn&rsquo;t…damn, that hurts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santa Greenwood hauled Finner to his feet.
&ldquo;Hold this,&rdquo;
he ordered,
thrusting his ax into Finner&rsquo;s hands.
He picked Santa Hood up and kissed her forehead.
&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said gently.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get you home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner never found out what world The Building was on.
What he <em>did</em> learn
as they trudged deeper and deeper into the forest that surrounded it
was that santas didn&rsquo;t just deliver presents to people.
On one world,
bears and wolves and beavers got gifts.
On another,
Santa Greenwood brought them for the ghosts of the departed,
who lingered in the heart of the green
far longer than they did in cities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which I figure stands to reason,
seein&rsquo; as how there&rsquo;s so much life there.&rdquo; he said conversationally.
He didn&rsquo;t appear to be breathing any harder than normal
despite Santa Hood&rsquo;s weight in his arms.
Her eyes were closed.
and Finner kept wanting Santa Greenwood to stop
so that he could check her pulse or make sure she was breathing or,
or <em>something</em>,
but keeping up with the burly santa left no time for requests.</p>
<p>After what seemed like all night but was probably only a few minutes
they reached a small clearing.
In its center stood the trunk of what had once been a mighty tree,
thicker than Finner&rsquo;s parents&rsquo; sleigh was wide.
It should have reached halfway to the sky,
but instead it stopped three stories above their heads
where lightning had shattered it long ago.
Its top looked like a blackened fang,
which made the aluminum ladder leaning against it
seem even more out of place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;—our chimney?
&lsquo;Fraid so.&rdquo;
Santa Greenwood hefted Santa Hood,
who grumbled quietly but didn&rsquo;t open her eyes.</p>
<p>He turned to Finner.
&ldquo;Best be about it, then,&rdquo; he said gruffly.
&ldquo;And good luck to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner blinked.
&ldquo;What?
Wait,
aren&rsquo;t you coming with me?
Or,
um,
aren&rsquo;t I going with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santa Greenwood shook his head.
Just once,
but firmly enough that Finner knew there would be no point arguing.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hold with lockin&rsquo; folks up,
and I&rsquo;ve never been able to say &lsquo;no&rsquo; to Periwinkle,
but all this talk about santas bein&rsquo; elves…&rdquo;
He shrugged,
then winced as Santa Hood grumbled again.
&ldquo;Anyway,
you go on ahead—best if you don&rsquo;t tell me where.
And like I said,
good luck to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But—&rdquo;
Finner swallowed hard.
&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santa Greenwood shrugged again.
&ldquo;Most of us don&rsquo;t,
lad,
but we gotta keep goin&rsquo; anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner nodded.
&ldquo;Okay.
And thank you—thank you both.
Tell her for me, will you?&rdquo;
Without waiting for answer he turned
and put his foot on the first rung of the ladder.</p>
<p>Santas aren&rsquo;t afraid of heights,<sup id="fnref:elephants"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:elephants">77</a></sup>
so Finner didn&rsquo;t hesitate as climbed higher and higher.
He didn&rsquo;t even flinch when the ladder shifted slightly under his weight
and settled into a new (and hopefully more secure) position.</p>
<p>At the top he found three dials screwed onto a plank,
which was in turn nailed onto the scorched side of the tree.
He peered over it.
The tree trunk was hollow,
which he guessed made sense from an &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a chimney&rdquo; point of view.
There were no instructions.</p>
<p><em>QCD</em>,
he thought.
He remembered those three letters from the airship,
and from Gran-Granna Tumbly&rsquo;s questioning,
but he couldn&rsquo;t remember the—what had she called the numbers?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squiggle factors,&rdquo; he said out loud.
He turned the first dial to &ldquo;QCD&rdquo;—</p>
<p>—and nearly fell off as Santa Hood&rsquo;s voice said,
&ldquo;Hi Finner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked down.
Santa Greenwood was still on the ground,
and Santa Hood was still in his arms,
but her voice was still speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;—hope you&rsquo;ll never hear this,
but I think Sensei Tumbly is getting suspicious,
and like she always says,
a backup plan you don&rsquo;t need is better than one you don&rsquo;t have.
So,
if I&rsquo;m not here to send you on your way,
try QXK 100.0 20.0.
It&rsquo;s the single most boring world in existence,
but you&rsquo;ll be safe there—at least,
as safe as you can be anywhere.
Good luck.&rdquo;
There was a moment&rsquo;s pause,
and then she continued in a deeper tone,
&ldquo;This chimney will self-destruct in five seconds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;
Finner reached for the dials.
&ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t even—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just kidding,&rdquo;
her recorded voice said in its normal tone.
&ldquo;Now get going,
and like I said,
good luck.&rdquo;
The recording paused again.
&ldquo;I hope you find what you&rsquo;re looking for or,
you know,
<em>who</em> you&rsquo;re looking for,
because I think that&rsquo;ll be amazing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Periwinkle,&rdquo; he whispered as the recording clicked off,
knowing that he&rsquo;d never have the courage to call her that to her face.
He took a deep breath and turned the first dial to &ldquo;QCD&rdquo;,
the second to &ldquo;143.7&rdquo;,
and the third to &ldquo;22.8&rdquo;.
He half-expected the recording to start up again
and tell him that he had gotten it wrong,
but it didn&rsquo;t and he hadn&rsquo;t.
When Gran-Granna Tumbly had been interrogating him
and had asked if he remembered the other settings from the airship
he had only hesitated a moment before lying.
He didn&rsquo;t know what would be on the other side of the chimney,
but—he glanced down again at Santa Greenwood and Santa Hood and sighed.
<em>I hope it&rsquo;s not too cold,</em> he thought,
then pressed the brass button set into the panel above the dials.</p>
<p>Everything stretched around him,
or possibly he did the stretching
and once again he was somewhere else.</p>

<h2>The Subway</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Hellscape (n.): short for &ldquo;hellish landscape&rdquo;.
Used to describe a harsh or extremely unpleasant locale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Hsst!</em> Get head down!&rdquo;
A hand clamped onto the top of Finner&rsquo;s head and pushed it down
before he had a chance to protest.
Something or someone large and furry
that smelled even more than he did<sup id="fnref:still-smelly"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:still-smelly">78</a></sup>
crouched beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must not let them see you,&rdquo;
his neighbor whispered loudly,
peering cautiously over the edge of the ditch
they were both now in
and then ducking down again.
Their beard was streaked with dirt,
and their santa suit had so much mud on it
that they were practically camouflaged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are &lsquo;they&rsquo;?&rdquo;
Finner whispered back.
All he could see was the dirt-and-cinderblock sides of the trench,
a dull gray strip of overcast above them.
<em>At least it&rsquo;s not cold,</em> he thought.</p>
<p>The santa ignored his question.
&ldquo;Come.
This way to safe place.&rdquo;
Shouldering a sack that was even filthier than their suit,
they scurried away.</p>
<p>Finner hesitated,
but then the ground shuddered slightly beneath him,
making the water tremble in the puddles by his feet.
All of a sudden,
Santa Hood&rsquo;s single most boring world in existence seemed pretty attractive.
He bent over and hurried after the filthy santa.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;safe place&rdquo; turned out to be an abandoned subway station
with cracked floor tiles and a truly memorable bouquet
that was equal parts damp earth, oily rust, and wet dog,
the last of which turned out to be coming from the santa&rsquo;s belongings.
Two square glass panels connected to a boxy battery
cast a gloomy blue light over their crates, boxes, sacks, and bags,
each one overflowing with broken toys,
salvaged pieces of clothing,
and kitchen implements still in their immaculate plastic packaging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit,&rdquo;
the santa ordered,
pointing with their thumb.
&ldquo;I make tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What—what is this place?
What happened here?&rdquo;
Finner asked,
seating himself gingerly on a wooden stool.</p>
<p>The santa snorted.
&ldquo;What happened?
War is happened!
First the elves with their neeny-neeny I-want-to-be-free.&rdquo;
His voice shot up half an octave as he said it.
&ldquo;So <em>da</em>,
we can talk about maybe some changes,
but then a ha!&rdquo;
Their hands shot into the air dramatically.
&ldquo;Ambush!
The santas,
they make trap,
only the elephants make trap as well
and is all go to <em>zerfak</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner didn&rsquo;t know what <em>zerfak</em> was,
but he could make a pretty good guess.
The elephants, though…
&ldquo;So what happened next?&rdquo; he asked cautiously.<sup id="fnref:what-next"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:what-next">79</a></sup></p>
<p>The filthy santa picked up a can,
shook it next to their ear,
frowned,
and tossed it away.
&ldquo;Is all ray guns and speeches and explosions and more speeches.
Then is everyone go away to fight somewhere else
except they leave elephants here.
Is make terrible mess, you see?&rdquo;
They waved one hand at everything
while rummaging through the pile of cans with the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Finner said.
&ldquo;So why did you stay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The filthy santa snorted.
&ldquo;Someone has to fix this all, yes?&rdquo;
They looked up,
and for a moment the light glistened on the tears in their eyes.
&ldquo;Because if not fixed,
how we will get presents to children?&rdquo;
They brightened.
&ldquo;Come—I show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner was <em>not</em> excited about going deeper into the derelict subway tunnel,
but when the filthy santa picked up both of the light panels and scurried away,
it was either that or sit in the dark
and listen to the slow drip, drip, drip from the ceiling.
He picked his way around the debris and piles of salvage.</p>
<p>The filthy santa waited impatiently for him in front of a heavy metal door.
&ldquo;Here, you take,&rdquo; the santa said,
passing one of the lights to Finner.
They punched a code into the panel beside the door,
turned a key in a lock,
turned a second key in another lock,
and swung the door open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Finner said again,
but this time he meant it.
The room he stepped into was as clean as the room behind him was dirty.
A double dozen workbenches lined the walls,
each one bearing lathes, saws, drills, and shelves of spare parts.
Cans of paint and oil were stacked neatly between them,
but he didn&rsquo;t see any of that,
not at first,
because standing in the center of the room was a red and white subway train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is beautiful, <em>da</em>?&rdquo; the filthy santa said,
putting an arm around Finner&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Finner said a third time.
The engine was decorated with silver bells
and had a small silver snowman as a crest.
Green enameled holly leaves ran up the sides of the three cars behind it.
Only when he looked at it again did he notice the scrapes and scratches,
the tell-tale scorch marks from ray gun fire,
and the sheets of plastic taped up where windows had once been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is very special,&rdquo; the filthy santa said,
lowering their voice.
&ldquo;Is its own chimney.
One of a kind—can go anywhere.
Well,
anywhere with track,&rdquo;
they amended.
&ldquo;But I must finish fixing before goes anywhere.
I am teach myself how—see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They dragged Finner over to the nearest workbench.
Books and manuals lay on top of it,
some with more scraps of paper tucked into them as placeholders
than they had pages.
Picking up a can of paint and a brush,
they marched over to the subway train,
squinted at it,
and dabbed a bit of red paint on one of the scorch marks.</p>
<p>Finner picked up one of the books.
<em>Mechanical Motors Part XVII: Reciprocating Drives</em> was stamped on the cover.
Inside were diagrams so detailed he would have needed a magnifying glass to make sense of them
and dense blocks of text interrupted by formulas and tables.
&ldquo;Are these…elf books?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The santa nodded vigorously.
&ldquo;All kinds.
Was school three stops that way before stupid <em>zerfak</em>.
I sneak past elephants and bring them here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But—&rdquo;
Finner paused for a moment to consider his words.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a bit unusual for a santa to be doing this kind of thing?&rdquo;
he finally ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pfeh.&rdquo;
The santa dabbed a bit more paint on the train.
&ldquo;Santa this, elf that—all this neeny-neeny who-does-what is foolishness.
What matters is,
people are happy or not, <em>da</em>?
I fix train,
train runs,
I deliver presents,
I am happy,
children are happy,
world is better place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner put <em>Mechanical Motors Part XVII</em> back on the workbench
and picked up a can of silver paint and a brush.
It took him a moment to open the can—he didn&rsquo;t want to spill any—but
then he found a spot a few steps away from the santa
and began dabbing paint on a scrape.
When the santa began humming a carol,
he joined in.</p>
<p>There was a shower.
The water was cold and the industrial smell of the soap stung Finner&rsquo;s nose,
but being clean again made it bearable.
And Subway Santa had a shelf full of clean uniforms
still in their environmentally-friendly wax-paper wrapping.
They were all too big for Finner,
but once he rolled up the cuffs a couple of times they felt luxurious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So tell me about the elephants,&rdquo;
Finner said,
tucking a spoonful of cold baked beans into his mouth.</p>
<p>Subway Santa shrugged.
&ldquo;Big.
Smart.
Dangerous.
Loud,
except when they want to be quiet,
and then they are like mice.&rdquo;
They glanced at Finner.
&ldquo;Quiet in elephants is very bad.
It means they are hunting.
If you cannot hear them,
it means they are hunting <em>you</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner gestured at the train they had been painting.
&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s the only way out of here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The santa shrugged again.
&ldquo;Is only going where tracks are.
Is normal chimney<sup id="fnref:normal-chimney"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:normal-chimney">80</a></sup> in factory,
but is elephants all around factory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner nodded slowly.
&ldquo;Then I guess I&rsquo;m going to get to meet some elephants,&rdquo;
he growled.</p>
<p>Subway Santa scowled petulantly.
&ldquo;Why you would want to do that?
I tell you over and over, elephants are dangerous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner shoveled a final spoonful of beans into his mouth,
chewed,
and swallowed.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone I need to talk to.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Elephants and Airships</h2>
<p>It took a week to finish fixing the subway train
and despite the cold showers and cold food,
Finner enjoyed every moment of it.
Well,
not &ldquo;enjoyed&rdquo; enjoyed—he bashed his thumb with a mallet at one point,
which really hurt,
and he was frustrated over and over again by how little he actually knew
about joints and couplings.
There were plane joints, hinge joints, pivot joints,
and (lower your voice when you say it) condyloid joints,
all of which had to be connected with sleeve couplings,
flanged couplings,
universal couplings,
and something called an Oldham coupling
that he and Subway Santa spent half an hour puzzling over
before the santa declared that the train would probably run without it.
They loosened bolts and tightened screws,
oiled pistons,
and cleaned the grime out of window jambs
so that the sashes slid up and down with only a faint <em>ssh</em>.</p>
<p>Every once in a while,
though,
Subway Santa raised his hand in warning.
When Finner paused and held his breath,
he heard heavy steps on the ground above their heads.
Neither of them moved until the ponderous <em>thud thud</em> had receded into the distance.</p>
<p>Once,
Finner knocked a tray of door handles off a workbench
when Subway Santa signaled it was safe to go back to work.
As they clattered onto the floor,
the elephants&rsquo; footsteps stopped.
He held his breath,
wide-eyed,
as they grew louder once again.
The lights suspended from the ceiling swayed slightly
as the elephants paused overhead.
Moments crawled by before a muffled trumpeting sent the patrol on its way again.</p>
<p>Finally the train was ready,
or at least ready enough.
Subway Santa assembled a complicated diagram out of thumbtacks and yarn
on top of a grimy old map of the city.
&ldquo;Cannot go straight to factory—will give away location of secret workshop,&rdquo;
they explained,
talking to themself as much as to Finner.
&ldquo;So we chimney to <em>here</em>,
taken elevated track to <em>here</em>,
switch lines,
use chimney on train again to get <em>here</em>.
Must slow a little for this bend,
so you are jumping off there
before pick up speed again and—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang on,&rdquo;
Finner interrupted.
&ldquo;Jump off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Da</em>.&rdquo;
The santa stabbed the map with a grimy fingernail.<sup id="fnref:no-shower"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:no-shower">81</a></sup>
&ldquo;Not safe for stopping.
Don&rsquo;t worry,
are bushes.
Well,
<em>were</em> bushes.
But will be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner packed an extra santa suit and a couple of cans of beans into a bag
and slung it over his shoulder.
&ldquo;Should take this also,&rdquo;
Subway Santa said gruffly,
handing him a flat case held closed by a pair of snaps.</p>
<p>Finner hefted it.
&ldquo;Thank you.
What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your tools,&rdquo;
the santa said.
They clapped Finner on the shoulder awkwardly.
&ldquo;I go start train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner swallowed the sudden lump in his throat
and tucked the case into his bag.
It was heavier than it had been,
but he didn&rsquo;t mind the weight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo;
Subway Santa asked as Finner closed the door of the subway engine car behind himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready,&rdquo; Finner said.</p>
<p>Subway Santa nodded and pulled first one lever and then another.
The subway car vibrated faintly as the engine came to life.
Pulling another lever,
the santa slowly pressed a pedal down with a booted foot.
At first nothing happened,
and for a heartbeat Finner was afraid that they had done something wrong,
or that <em>he</em> had done something wrong,
but then the train began to roll forward,
slowly at first and then faster and faster.</p>
<p>He grabbed a bar overhead to steady himself as Subway Santa giggled maniacally.
&ldquo;Is working!
Is working!
Oh, I love you so much!&rdquo;
They leaned forward and kissed the train&rsquo;s control panel.</p>
<p>Faster and faster,
out of the workshop and into the tunnel.
The train&rsquo;s headlamp came on as it raced along the tracks.
Finner and Subway Santa had spent hours clearing debris from them,
huffing and puffing as they stacked fallen pieces of tile and masonry on a handcart
to dump in a side passage.
They hurtled past their hard work in moments,
whooping with excitement as they shot out of the darkness into the gray light of an overcast day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we go!&rdquo; Subway Santa shouted.
They reached up and pulled a lever attached to a large brass box welded to the ceiling.
The world in of the train stretched
and did something that by rights ought to have made a sound like <em>sproing!</em>
and they were elsewhere,
still under the same sky and surrounded by the same ruined buildings
but on a different stretch of track with a steep incline right in front of them.
A <em>very</em> steep incline.
In fact,
they were on a roller coaster.</p>
<p>Subway Santa hooted and hollered loudly enough
to drown out Finner&rsquo;s terrified scream
as they crested the top of the track and hurtled down.
&ldquo;Hang on!&rdquo;
Subway Santa shouted just before they hit a corkscrew section of track.
Finner clamped one hand around an overhead bar and the other over his mouth
as he was upside down,
right-side up,
upside down again,
and—nope,
now he was sideways as they rocketed around an impossibly tight turn,
or at least his body was sideways,
he wasn&rsquo;t sure where the cold beans he&rsquo;d had for breakfast were going.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again!&rdquo; the manic santa shouted,
pedalling pedals and pulling levers.
Half the lights on the control panel in front of them were red<sup id="fnref:panel-lights"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:panel-lights">82</a></sup>
as they stretched again.</p>
<p>The ruined buildings around them were taller this time.
The few shards of glass left in their windows looked like jagged teeth in hungry mouths.
Then a windowless tower a few blocks away lifted, swung forward, and came down
with a thud that made the train shiver on the tracks.
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Finner said blankly.</p>
<p>When you think about elephants,
you probably think about something two or three times your height
with gray skin,
flappy ears,
and a long trunk.
You might think of tusks or give the picture in your head a cute little tail.
You might even imagine it spraying water on its back.</p>
<p>Now put that all aside
and imagine something big enough to knock down a skyscraper.
Four legs, yes, and a trunk,
but it has a thick brown pelt
and its eyes are bright with fury.
These elephants are the reason Santa Claws stays in his castle,
and one of them has just spotted the crushable collection of tin cans you are riding in.</p>
<p>The elephant raised its trunk and trumpeted,
shattering nearby windows with the sound.
Swing, thud, swing, thud—its first few steps were almost casual,
but then it started to pick up speed.</p>
<p>Another blast of sound nearly deafened Finner
as a second elephant answered the first one&rsquo;s call.
&ldquo;They try to cut us off!&rdquo;
Subway Santa shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;
Finner shouted back.</p>
<p>Subway Santa shook his head and pulled another lever.
Steam whistled from the control panel as they picked up speed.
&ldquo;Is good thing I take safeties off engine, <em>da</em>?
Otherwise would shut down to stop from exploding!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment they were surrounded by overgrown park instead of buildings.
Finner twisted around.
The elephant that had first spotted them had broken into a trot,
each step eating up half a city block.
The second elephant was closing in on the right,
and he had a brief glimpse of a third one somewhere up ahead
before they were back in the ruins of the city.</p>
<p>Subway Santa reached back and tugged on Finner&rsquo;s sleeve.
&ldquo;Get ready!
I slow down for next turn,
you jump!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finner looked back again.
The elephant was galloping now and closing fast.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to make it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Subway Santa beamed.
&ldquo;Will be good!
I have presents!&rdquo;
They reached up,
flipped the safety cover off a big red button,<sup id="fnref:red-button"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:red-button">83</a></sup>
and punched it with their fist.</p>
<p><em>Clunk!</em>
The hitch connected to the last car in the train snapped open.
As the rest of the train pulled away from it,
Subway Santa counted,
&ldquo;One smelly reindeer, two smelly reindeer…&rdquo;
As they hit &ldquo;five&rdquo;,
the car exploded.</p>

<li id="fn:raised-eyebrow">
<p><em>Purely by coincidence</em> a slight shiver went down Finner&rsquo;s spine as she did so.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:raised-eyebrow" title="Jump back to footnote 38 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:parrot">
<p>The parrot would have been somewhat offended by this phrasing, as she thought of the captain as being hers. Luckily for our story, the parrot found turning pages so difficult that she never bothered to read books.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:parrot" title="Jump back to footnote 39 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:eyebrow-no-shiver">
<p>Which, funnily enough, <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> send a shiver down Finner&rsquo;s spine.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:eyebrow-no-shiver" title="Jump back to footnote 40 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:hands-up">
<p>Whic is more accurate than saying &ldquo;he raised his hands&rdquo; because his brain wasn&rsquo;t really involved in the process.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:hands-up" title="Jump back to footnote 41 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:writing-teacher">
<p>The first time Finner had to bring home a note from that teacher, his parents let it sit on the dinner table <em>until dinner</em> before opening it. They didn&rsquo;t mention it or even look at it, which of course meant Finner couldn&rsquo;t think about anything else. It turned out to be a reminder about an overdue book addressed to another student, which left Finner feeling somehow cheated out of a calamity.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:writing-teacher" title="Jump back to footnote 42 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:baggage">
<p>A term used only occasionally by Gran-Granna Tumbly that always provoked a mix of shock, dismay, and grudging admissions that yes, so-and-so <em>did</em> seem like the sort of person who would bring a store-bought sweater as a baby gift instead of something hand-made.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:baggage" title="Jump back to footnote 43 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:unfortunate-incident">
<p>Which admittedly wouldn&rsquo;t be all that much safer if there was what his writing teacher would probably have referred to as &ldquo;an unfortunate incident&rdquo;.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:unfortunate-incident" title="Jump back to footnote 44 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

</li>
<li id="fn:gym-sock">
<p>The particular sock he was thinking of had belonged to a classmate of his whose idea of &ldquo;funny&rdquo; was sneaking up behind people and stuffing a sock or a mitten in their mouth. He was eventually eaten by a crocodile while trying to win an ill-considered dare. Nobody really missed him except his parents, and even they were secretly a little relieved.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:gym-sock" title="Jump back to footnote 47 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

</li>
<li id="fn:try-funny">

</li>
<li id="fn:second-door">
<p>Which is why he never got to find out what &ldquo;BCB RNV&rdquo; meant, or why there was a hand-lettered note below the title reminding readers to make sure their next-of-kin form was up to date before entering.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:second-door" title="Jump back to footnote 50 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn:flip-switch">
<p>Much harder than he needed to from a mechanical point of view, but exactly hard enough emotionally.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:flip-switch" title="Jump back to footnote 51 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

</li>
<li id="fn:wrinkles-face">
<p>Old people don&rsquo;t actually have more wrinkles than young ones. The real difference is that young people&rsquo;s skin hasn&rsquo;t had enough practice wrinkling to do it all the time. By the time you have smiled or frowned as often as someone like Gran-Granna Tumbly, your wrinkles are like a weight lifter&rsquo;s biceps. Some cultures regard strongly-defined wrinkles as a sign of virtue, and have specialized gyms where people wiggle their eyebrows to music or smirk over and over again while a personal trainer urges them on.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:wrinkles-face" title="Jump back to footnote 53 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn:word-didnt-know">
<p>Though he had heard them both use it while playing dominoes.

</li>
<li id="fn:airship-mess">
<p>The airship, that is—Finner never got to see the mess on the first airship, and technically, it didn&rsquo;t attack the <em>Dancing Marmot</em>: it was just along for the ride when the airship did.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:airship-mess" title="Jump back to footnote 64 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn:everything-hour">
<p>Fun fact: if could talk approximately 120,094,200,000,000 times faster than normal, you could tell someone everything that had happened to a single subatomic particle since the beginning of the universe.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:everything-hour" title="Jump back to footnote 66 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

</li>
<li id="fn:they-were-scared">
<p>You won&rsquo;t really understand <em>how</em> scared unless you have kids of your own one day, at which point you will occasionally wake up in a cold sweat in the middle of the night wondering how common meteor strikes actually are and whether there are any warning signs you can teach your offspring to look out for when they&rsquo;re not looking out for cars, falling trees, or hungry leopards.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:they-were-scared" title="Jump back to footnote 68 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn:p-word">
<p><em>Not</em> &ldquo;patients&rdquo; and <em>definitely</em> not &ldquo;prisoners&rdquo;.

</li>
<li id="fn:midnight-note">
<p>If you ever have to help someone escape from prison—and yes, despite the lack of bars on the windows, The Building very definitely <em>was</em> a prison—please try to be more precise than this in your directions. Did &ldquo;midnight&rdquo; mean &ldquo;midnight the day this letter was sent&rdquo;? If so, Finner had already missed his rendezvous. Did it mean &ldquo;midnight the day the letter is opened&rdquo;? How could the sender possibly know that? Or did it mean &ldquo;every midnight for the next few nights but please don&rsquo;t take too long because sooner or later someone will spot me loitering&rdquo;? If that had not in fact been the intended meaning in this case, our story would probably have ended here and never been told, which would have left me with an awful lot of blank pages.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:midnight-note" title="Jump back to footnote 74 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

</li>
<li id="fn:elephants">
<p>Not even Subway Santa, who spent their life underground and never had a chance to realize that heights didn&rsquo;t bother them.

<li id="fn:no-shower">
<p>To Finner&rsquo;s relief, Subway Santa actually did shower regularly, but immediately re-filthed their hair, beard, and clothes for extra security.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:no-shower" title="Jump back to footnote 81 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

</li>
<li id="fn:red-button">
<p>It had taken the santa almost a day to choose an appropriate button. It had to be red—tradition demanded nothing less—but they dithered for a while between one with the word &ldquo;DANGER!&rdquo; stamped on it and another shaped like a skull and crossbones. In the end, they went with something smaller and more tasteful.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:red-button" title="Jump back to footnote 83 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
