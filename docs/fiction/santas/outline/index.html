<!-- content --><h1>All the Other Santas</h1>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="../">All the Other Santas</a></em> is a middle-grade story about a young santa who secretly wants to be an elf<ul>
<li>Being trans</li>
<li>Revolutionaries of one generation become the reactionaries of the next</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The story is a fast-paced adventure with occasional moments of character-driven heartbreak<ul>
<li>Chases, cartoon-ish battles, and sly asides</li>
<li>Periodically interrupted by serious moments that show characters&rsquo; pain and their desire for love and acceptance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Approximately 31,000 words</li>
</ul>
<h2>Setting</h2>
<ul>
<li>There are many parallel worlds, each with its own santas and elves</li>
<li>Used to be that santas always married elves and vice versa<ul>
<li>Long struggle led to santa-santa and elf-elf relationships being accepted (ish)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Traditional division of labor is that elves make presents and santas deliver them<ul>
<li>Santas are socially dominant, elves are stay-at-home introverts</li>
<li>Most people in the &ldquo;gifting community&rdquo; still believe this is how things ought to be</li>
<li>But some (referred to as &ldquo;flips&rdquo;) are now challenging this</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Metaphors<ul>
<li>Same-role marriage is a metaphor for gay marriage / gay rights</li>
<li>Role switching is a metaphor for trans rights</li>
<li>Note: same-sex relationships are unremarkable in this world</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note also: santas use portals called &ldquo;wherevers&rdquo; to travel between worlds<ul>
<li>And within them to deliver gifts, although staunch traditionalists regard that as cheating</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Characters</h2>
<ul>
<li>Finner (protagonist): a young santa who secretly wants to make things<ul>
<li>Character arc: finds the courage to defy his family (particularly Gran-Granna Tumbly) and join the fight for flip rights</li>
<li>He realizes that he can&rsquo;t have that unless others have it too: none of us are free unless all of us are free</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gran-Granna Tumbly (principal antagonist): traditionalist matriarch of Finner&rsquo;s family<ul>
<li>Character arc: doesn&rsquo;t have the courage to change (opposite of Finner)</li>
<li>Her given name is Vidancia, but only Santa Greenwood calls her that</li>
<li>Tumbly and her wife Shady Ann were famous campaigners for same-role relationships</li>
<li>Wife disappeared years ago, presumed lost</li>
<li>Tumbly is now part of a public campaign against the flips</li>
<li>Hood and Greenwood are part of the &ldquo;dirty tricks&rdquo; arm of this campaign</li>
<li>Secretly helping to kidnap flips for re-education at The Building</li>
<li>Hood and Greenwood don&rsquo;t know about this: finding out makes them change sides</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Santa Hood (ally to foe): steals from the rich to give to the poor (so she doesn&rsquo;t need elves of her own)<ul>
<li>Wisecracking and beautiful (makes Finner acutely self-conscious)</li>
<li>Her given name is Periwinkle, but only Santa Greenwood calls her that</li>
<li>One of Gran-Granna&rsquo;s agents in her clandestine campaign against the flips</li>
<li>She and Greenwood are a couple: they follow Tumbly because she made their relationship possible</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Santa Greenwood (ally to foe to ally): a forest santa who delivers gifts to trees (soil, water, pruning)<ul>
<li>When someone says &ldquo;it looks like gardening&rdquo; his response is &ldquo;where do you think gardeners learned it?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Big, gruff, straightforward (which isn&rsquo;t the same as simple-minded)</li>
<li>His father (Clausbeard) never understood Greenwood&rsquo;s love for trees but accepted it</li>
<li>Greenwood&rsquo;s decision to leave the sea for the forest foreshadows Finner&rsquo;s crisis and makes him sympathetic to it</li>
<li>Contrasts with Gran-Granna Tumbly&rsquo;s refusal to accept Finner&rsquo;s differentness</li>
<li>His real name is Steve (but that&rsquo;s only mentioned once)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Captain Clausbeard (part of Greenwood&rsquo;s story): a sea-going santa and Santa Greenwood&rsquo;s father<ul>
<li>Their relationship has always been difficult (pirates aren&rsquo;t very good at talking about their feelings)</li>
<li>Made more difficult by the fact that Clausbeard sympathizes with the flips (&ldquo;pirates aren&rsquo;t much for rules&rdquo;)</li>
<li>But he has come to accept his son Greenwood for who he is</li>
<li>Clausbeard gets along very well with Santa Hood (they talk shop)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Santa Hotep (role model of sorts): a mummified santa who lives in a pyramid<ul>
<li>Has no one left to deliver presents to, but finds it peaceful after thousands of years of delivery</li>
<li>Secretly started making things for himself after his last elf died (the work reminds him of the elf)</li>
<li>Represents elderly closeted queers who have come to accept themselves</li>
<li>Helps Finner come to accept who he is</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Zubi (contrasting path): a young elf that Finner meets at The Building<ul>
<li>Was secretly delivering presents, but has given up and is trying to be &ldquo;normal&rdquo;</li>
<li>Unlike most inmates, wasn&rsquo;t abducted: turned himself in</li>
<li>Doesn&rsquo;t have the courage to escape with Finner: instead, reveals Finner&rsquo;s first escape plan</li>
<li>Despite that, Finner tries to help him escape again</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shady Ann (part of Tumbly&rsquo;s back story): lives underground in a frozen post-apocalyptic world<ul>
<li>Campaigned with Tumbly for same-role rights</li>
<li>Returned to her world (&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hell, but it&rsquo;s home, and people needed me&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Had always made things, but started making more as her world grew more desperate</li>
<li>Turns out Subway Santa is still alive, still making things</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Elfabot (part of Tumbly&rsquo;s back story): a robotic helper<ul>
<li>Shady Ann made it to help make and deliver presents (and because she missed her wife)</li>
<li>That tipped Tumbly into her hardline anti-flip position</li>
<li>The Elfabot makes forays into other worlds to get medicine, food, and what-not</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Santazilla: a giant <em>santasaurus rex</em><ul>
<li>Hunts for Shady Ann in the burned-out world</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Book<ul>
<li>Narrates the warning at the start</li>
<li>The voice of the footnotes</li>
<li>Reappears to narrate the conclusion: if Finner can change, so can I and so can you</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p>Chapter 2:
    discussion with Gran-Granna Tumbly,
    who clearly understands what Finner is hinting at and is not sympathetic (see her steely disposition);
    mention picture on the shelf of two santas (taken from behind on a mountaintop);
    unexpected arrival of Santa Greenwood and Santa Hood;
    they were ambushed while doing something unspecified
    (Hood is about to say it but then catches sight of Finner and stops herself);

<li>
<p>Chapter 4:
    discussion with Santa Hotep;

    which one of the guard cat statues says hasn&rsquo;t been used in centuries

    but is willing to turn a blind eye as long as Hotep keeps that to himself;

    escape through Santa Hotep&rsquo;s wherever.</p>

    (darted him by mistake—apologize for that);
    he tries to escape and finds a wall with pictures of missing elves and santas;
    his captors take him to see the captain,
    who looks like an elvish version of Hood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 9:
    captain is Hood&rsquo;s twin sister Snood;
    born an elf with the temperament of a santa;
    parents wanted one of each so tried to squash her personality;

    which drove them apart;

<p>Chapter 14:
    Finner in The Building;
    meets Zubi;

    Finner responds, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I want the chance to find out&rdquo;;
    he and Hotep leave to find Snood,
