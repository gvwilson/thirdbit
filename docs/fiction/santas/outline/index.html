<!-- content --><h1>All the Other Santas</h1>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="../">All the Other Santas</a></em> is a middle-grade story about a young santa who secretly wants to be an elf<ul>
<li>Being trans</li>
<li>Revolutionaries of one generation become the reactionaries of the next</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The story is a fast-paced adventure with occasional moments of character-driven heartbreak<ul>
<li>Chases, cartoon-ish battles, and sly asides</li>
<li>Periodically interrupted by serious moments that show characters&rsquo; pain and their desire for love and acceptance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Approximately 31,000 words</li>
</ul>
<h2>Setting</h2>
<ul>
<li>There are many parallel worlds, each with its own santas and elves</li>
<li>Used to be that santas always married elves and vice versa<ul>
<li>Long struggle led to santa-santa and elf-elf relationships being accepted (ish)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Traditional division of labor is that elves make presents and santas deliver them<ul>
<li>Santas are socially dominant, elves are stay-at-home introverts</li>
<li>Most people in the &ldquo;gifting community&rdquo; still believe this is how things ought to be</li>
<li>But some (referred to as &ldquo;flips&rdquo;) are now challenging this</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Metaphors<ul>
<li>Same-role marriage is a metaphor for gay marriage / gay rights</li>
<li>Role switching is a metaphor for trans rights</li>
<li>Note: same-sex relationships are unremarkable in this world</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note also: santas use portals called &ldquo;wherevers&rdquo; to travel between worlds<ul>
<li>And within them to deliver gifts, although staunch traditionalists regard that as cheating</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Characters</h2>
<ul>
<li>Finner (protagonist): a young santa who secretly wants to make things<ul>
<li>Character arc: finds the courage to defy his family (particularly Gran-Granna Tumbly) and join the fight for flip rights</li>
<li>He realizes that he can&rsquo;t have that unless others have it too: none of us are free unless all of us are free</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gran-Granna Tumbly (principal antagonist): traditionalist matriarch of Finner&rsquo;s family<ul>
<li>Character arc: doesn&rsquo;t have the courage to change (opposite of Finner)</li>
<li>Her given name is Vidancia, but only Santa Greenwood calls her that</li>
<li>Tumbly and her wife were famous campaigners for same-role relationships</li>
<li>Wife disappeared years ago, presumed lost</li>
<li>Tumbly is now part of a public campaign against the flips</li>
<li>Hood and Greenwood are part of the &ldquo;dirty tricks&rdquo; arm of this campaign</li>
<li>Secretly helping to kidnap flips for re-education at The Building</li>
<li>Hood and Greenwood don&rsquo;t know about this: finding out makes them change sides</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Santa Hood (ally to foe): steals from the rich to give to the poor (so she doesn&rsquo;t need elves of her own)<ul>
<li>Wisecracking and beautiful (makes Finner acutely self-conscious)</li>
<li>Her given name is Periwinkle, but only Santa Greenwood calls her that</li>
<li>One of Gran-Granna&rsquo;s agents in her clandestine campaign against the flips</li>
<li>She and Greenwood are a couple: they follow Tumbly because she made their relationship possible</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Santa Greenwood (ally to foe to ally): a forest santa who delivers gifts to trees (soil, water, pruning)<ul>
<li>When someone says &ldquo;it looks like gardening&rdquo; his response is &ldquo;where do you think gardeners learned it?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Big, gruff, straightforward (which isn&rsquo;t the same as simple-minded)</li>
<li>His father (Clausbeard) never understood Greenwood&rsquo;s love for trees but accepted it</li>
<li>Greenwood&rsquo;s decision to leave the sea for the forest foreshadows Finner&rsquo;s crisis and makes him sympathetic to it</li>
<li>Contrasts with Gran-Granna Tumbly&rsquo;s refusal to accept Finner&rsquo;s differentness</li>
<li>His real name is Steve (but that&rsquo;s only mentioned once)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Captain Clausbeard (part of Greenwood&rsquo;s story): a sea-going santa and Santa Greenwood&rsquo;s father<ul>
<li>Their relationship has always been difficult (pirates aren&rsquo;t very good at talking about their feelings)</li>
<li>Made more difficult by the fact that Clausbeard sympathizes with the flips (&ldquo;pirates aren&rsquo;t much for rules&rdquo;)</li>
<li>But he has come to accept his son Greenwood for who he is</li>
<li>Clausbeard gets along very well with Santa Hood (they talk shop)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Santa Hotep (role model of sorts): a mummified santa who lives in a pyramid<ul>
<li>Has no one left to deliver presents to, but finds it peaceful after thousands of years of delivery</li>
<li>Secretly started making things for himself after his last elf died (the work reminds him of the elf)</li>
<li>Represents elderly closeted queers who have come to accept themselves</li>
<li>Helps Finner come to accept who he is</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Zubi (contrasting path): a young elf that Finner meets at The Building<ul>
<li>Was secretly delivering presents, but has given up and is trying to be &ldquo;normal&rdquo;</li>
<li>Unlike most inmates, wasn&rsquo;t abducted: turned himself in</li>
<li>Doesn&rsquo;t have the courage to escape with Finner: instead, reveals Finner&rsquo;s first escape plan</li>
<li>Despite that, Finner tries to help him escape again</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Subway Santa (part of Tumbly&rsquo;s back story): lives underground in a frozen post-apocalyptic world<ul>
<li>Real name is Shady Ann</li>
<li>Campaigned with Tumbly for same-role rights</li>
<li>Returned to her world (&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hell, but it&rsquo;s home, and people needed me&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Had always made things, but started making more as her world grew more desperate</li>
<li>Turns out Subway Santa is still alive, still making things</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Roboclaus (part of Tumbly&rsquo;s back story): a robotic replica of Tumbly<ul>
<li>Subway Santa made a robot replica of Tumbly to help make and deliver presents (and because she missed her wife)</li>
<li>That tipped Tumbly into her hardline anti-flip position</li>
<li>Roboclaus makes forays into other worlds to get medicine, food, and what-not</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Santazilla: a giant <em>santasaurus rex</em><ul>
<li>Hunts for Subway Santa in the burned-out world</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Book<ul>
<li>Narrates the warning at the start</li>
<li>The voice of the footnotes</li>
<li>Reappears to narrate the conclusion: if Finner can change, so can I and so can you</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Plot</h2>
<h3>Act 1</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Chapter 1:
    introduce Finner and his conflict (he likes making things but is ashamed);
    goes to Gran-Granna Tumbly&rsquo;s house at the urging of his parents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 2:
    discussion with Gran-Granna Tumbly,
    who clearly understands what Finner is hinting at and is not sympathetic (see her steely disposition);
    mention picture on the shelf of two santas (taken from behind on a mountaintop);
    unexpected arrival of Santa Greenwood and Santa Hood;
    they were ambushed while doing something unspecified
    (Hood is about to say it but then catches sight of Finner and stops herself);
    Tumbly thinks they were ambushed by flips but Hood says no, it&rsquo;s worse, it&rsquo;s <em>them</em>,
    and then attackers arrive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 3:
    battle with the robotic santas, elves, and what-not pursuing Greenwood and Hood;
    escape through Gran-Granna Tumbly&rsquo;s wherever to desert world
    (&ldquo;Keep the boy safe until I can figure out what to do about him&rdquo;);
    meeting Santa Hotep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 4:
    discussion with Santa Hotep;
    Finner wanders off and finds a workshop with distinctive wooden furniture,
    which one of the guard cat statues says hasn&rsquo;t been used in centuries
    even though Finner is sure he smells freshly cut wood;
    discussion over tea hints that Hood (at least) knows that Hotep is making things,
    but is willing to turn a blind eye as long as Hotep keeps that to himself;
    second attack by robots (&ldquo;Give us the wherever code for The Building!&rdquo;);
    escape through Santa Hotep&rsquo;s wherever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 5:
    life raft and sharks;
    rescue by Clausbeard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 6:
    Clausbeard is taking supplies somewhere
    (about to say it, stops when Hood glances at Finner and shakes her head);
    Greenwood makes a snide remark about him being a freighter captain now)
    back story about Clausbeard and Santa Greenwood&rsquo;s decision to lead a different life
    (foreshadowing Greenwood&rsquo;s later sympathy for Finner);
    Santa Hood turns the zap gun on Finner:
    is he a robot substituted when he wandered off in the pyramid?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 7:
    Finner convinces Hood he&rsquo;s real
    (thinks briefly about letting her check his heartbeat but that would be too embarrassing);
    Finner accidentally discovers that he can use the zap gun that is only supposed to work for elves
    (which chills him: is he a flip after all?);
    airship attacks (trying to intercept supplies / get the wherever code for The Building);
    Clausbeard orders one of the crew to radio for air support
    (&ldquo;Hold &lsquo;em off &lsquo;til the flyers get here!&rdquo;);
    Finner joins the fight (first time we see him act instead of react);
    Finner is knocked out and captured.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Act 2</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Chapter 8:
    Finner wakes up on the airship;
    meets the flip crew (elves dressed as santas, santas working in the engine room);
    they saw him use the zap gun and thought he was a prisoner
    (darted him by mistake—apologize for that);
    he tries to escape and finds a wall with pictures of missing elves and santas;
    his captors take him to see the captain,
    who looks like an elvish version of Hood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 9:
    captain is Hood&rsquo;s twin sister Snood;
    born an elf with the temperament of a santa;
    parents wanted one of each so tried to squash her personality;
    Snood says that Hood always enjoyed the tinkering part of thieving but wouldn&rsquo;t admit elvish tendencies,
    which drove them apart;
    puzzled when Finner accuses her (and the flips) of replacing people with robots;
    points to crewmembers who are obviously robots and says, &ldquo;Who would be fooled?&rdquo;;
    conversation cut short when airship is attacked by biplanes;
    Finner escapes through the wherever to a random world.</p>

    rescued by RoboClaus;
    panics when he realizes that RoboClaus is a robot.</p>

<p>Chapter 11:
    RoboClaus takes him to meet Subway Santa;
    Finner claims to be a flip trying to escape from Gran-Granna Tumbly;
    Finner notices a picture on the wall (same two santas from behind as on Tumbly&rsquo;s mantelpiece);

</li>
<li>

    which he believes is proof that Subway Santa is making robots to replace people;
    Santazilla attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 13:
    &ldquo;rescued&rdquo; by Santa Hood and Santa Greenwood,
    who led Santazilla to Subway Santa&rsquo;s lair as a distraction
    (a decision that causes Finner angst, because he liked the workshop);
    Hood and Greenwood reveal that they put a tracking device on Finner on Tumbly&rsquo;s orders
    (they at least have the grace to appear uncomfortable about it);
    is returned to Gran-Granna Tumbly,
    who now has uniformed guards for her safety;
    she accuses him of being a robot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 14:
    Finner loses his temper, which convinces Tumbly that he&rsquo;s real;
    makes Hood uncomfortable talking about her twin sister;
    recklessly makes a crack about having seen a photo like the one on Tumbly&rsquo;s mantelpiece recently;
    Finner goes home and tries to fit back in;
    Finner&rsquo;s parents catch him making things.</p>

<li>
<p>Chapter 15:
    Finner in The Building;
    meets Zubi;
    they become friends;
    they try to escape,
    ut their escape turns out to be a trap (a test of whether they&rsquo;re actually trying to &ldquo;get better&rdquo;);
    Finner is moved to a more secure part of The Building.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 16:
    Finner&rsquo;s darkest moment (relentlessly cheerful attempts to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; him);
    visit from Gran-Granna Tumbly, who believes she is helping him;
    he tells her he has put the pieces together and knows that Subway Santa was her partner;
    she delivers a table from Santa Hotep that includes a secret message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 17:
    Finner escapes but Zubi doesn&rsquo;t come with him;
    met by Greenwood and Hood;
    Greenwood thinks that Finner reached out to <em>them</em>;
    reveals that they were being chased at the start because they had just kidnapped a flip and delivered him to The Building;
    ambushed by Gran-Granna&rsquo;s zealots;
    Greenwood realizes that Hood has betrayed him (a loyalty test: the message in the table leg was too easy to find);
    Hood reveals that she has been increasingly worried by Greenwood&rsquo;s gardening
    (&ldquo;you&rsquo;re making planter boxes! what are you going to make next?&rdquo;);
    Hotep&rsquo;s cats show up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 18:
    fight reveals that the cats are robots;

    conversation with Hotep, who has finally decided to pick sides
    (his original cats died long ago, Subway Santa made robotic replacements);
    RoboClaus reveals that Subway Santa is dying of radiation, old age, and heartbreak;
    Subway Santa hoped Hotep could arrange an attempt at reconciliation with Tumbly before the end;
    Hotep in turn hoped that Finner could help make the connection (&ldquo;she really does care about you&rdquo;);
    RoboClaus denies replacing people with robots,
    reveals that Tumbly has made up that story to get people on her side in the anti-flip campaign
    (&ldquo;Told your parents it had happened to you&rdquo;);
    robots are trying to help the flips because they are so outnumbered;
    Tumbly and her forces attack (echo of the robots&rsquo; attack in Chapter 3).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 20:
    Finner uses the wherever to go back to Subway Santa&rsquo;s world to get help;
    finds the workshop has mostly been destroyed by Santazilla;
    one last conversation with Subway Santa, who gives Finner a letter for Tumbly before dying;
    Finner leads Santazilla through the wherever into Hotep&rsquo;s world,
    where it scatters Tumbly&rsquo;s forces;
    Finner points the zap gun at Tumbly and forces her to take the letter
    (turns out to be the photo with &ldquo;I loved what we made together&rdquo; written on the back);
    Tumbly discards it (showing that she won&rsquo;t change her mind);
    Tumbly asks, &ldquo;Do you really want to be an elf?&rdquo;;
    Finner responds, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I want the chance to find out&rdquo;;
    he and Hotep leave to find Snood,
    free Greenwood and everyone else held in The Building,
    and continue the fight.</p>
