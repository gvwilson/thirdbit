<!-- content --><h1>Eimin</h1>
<ul>
<li><em>Eimin</em> is a YA fantasy novel about a teenage boy trying to find his place in the world.</li>
<li>Most people in his village (Medef) are Aphsi (empaths): they can <em>drome</em> the feelings of others.</li>
<li>But Eimin is <em>nif</em> (the equivalent of deaf), which makes him feel socially awkward.<ul>
<li>Almost all <em>nif</em> are male.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Being <em>nif</em> is a metaphor for deafness, but also for being on the spectrum and feeling that you don&rsquo;t understand people.</li>
<li>The story should appeal to bookish kids who feel that they never quite fit in.</li>
<li>The story is told in the first person from Eimin&rsquo;s point of view.</li>
<li>
<p>Occasional asides give the impression that he is actually telling the story to the reader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Problem: need action to sustain the story between the opening and the climax.</p>
</li>
<li>Something that foreshadows Suresh&rsquo;s betrayal.</li>
<li>Something involving the lion bandit and the gargoyles.</li>
<li>Caravan is attacked on its way to Medef.</li>
<li>Lion and her bandits growing more desperate because of increasing drought (foreshadow bigger theme).</li>
<li>Eimin and Razi leads the caravan across the narrow strait in the Sea of Glass.<ul>
<li>This is where they have to drive off the gargoyles (?).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Three-part structure</li>
<li>Rescuing the caravan.</li>
<li>Suresh in Medef.</li>
<li>Eimin&rsquo;s crisis and the resolution.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Major Characters</h2>
<ul>
<li>Eimin (protagonist): male, 16, born and raised in Medef (more below).</li>
<li>Hediyeh (antagonist): female, also 16, born and raised in Medef.</li>
<li>Enjoys other people&rsquo;s hurt the way some people enjoy the taste of ripe cheese.</li>
<li>Knows that Eimin has a crush on her, but dismisses him (both because he&rsquo;s <em>nif</em> and because she&rsquo;s mean).</li>
<li>Suresh (antagonist): male, 20, a traveling magician with a love of books.</li>
<li>Initially friendly to both Eimin and Hediyeh, but alienates Eimin by growing closer to Hediyeh.</li>
<li>Turns out that he wants to sacrifice (his affection for) Hediyeh to increase his power.</li>
<li>Razi: a <em>nif</em> of Eimin&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s age who visits Medef two or three times a year.</li>
<li>He is one of Lady Kembe&rsquo;s &ldquo;hands in the world&rdquo; (does the practical things she can&rsquo;t).</li>
<li>Becomes Eimin&rsquo;s teacher, but we later discover that he is training Eimin to be part of the Other Hand.</li>
<li>Razi doesn&rsquo;t know how old he is or where he comes from (he suspects as a result of some old spell).</li>
</ul>
<h3>More about Eimin</h3>
<ul>
<li>Story arc: he comes to accept himself.</li>
<li>An only child: his father left the family when he was a child.</li>
<li>Eimin blames himself, even though his mother has told him that she and his father just fell out of love.</li>
<li>Wants Hediyeh and despises himself for it.</li>
<li>She&rsquo;s the alpha female in his age cohort, and wanting what he can&rsquo;t have is a way of punishing himself.</li>
<li>Recognizing this and outgrowing it is part of his story arc.</li>
<li>Finds out he&rsquo;s being trained by Razi to join the Other Hand (<em>nif</em> who protect the Aphsi from outsiders).</li>
<li>The Aphsi can&rsquo;t kill because of their empathy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Minor Characters</h2>
<ul>
<li>Jephel (male, teenager): placid <em>nif</em> a couple of years older than Eimin who is apprenticed to Medef&rsquo;s butcher.</li>
<li>Already accepts himself in a way that Eimin both despises and envies (foil for Eimin).</li>
<li>Mureya (female, teenager): one of Hediyeh&rsquo;s circle who is in a budding relationship with Jephel.</li>
<li>Story arc: breaking free from Hediyeh.</li>
<li>Grappa Uzman (male, elderly): brusque old Aphsi who keeps goats.</li>
<li>Lady Kembe (female): magician in Ossisswe (mentioned but never encountered).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li>Magicians must trade parts of themselves for power.</li>
<li>Eimin makes a bitter comment about getting nothing in exchange for being <em>nif</em>.</li>
<li>Razi replies that most people in the world don&rsquo;t either.</li>
<li>The Pilots could trade parts of other people.</li>
<li>People have been trying to regain that power since their fall.</li>
<li>Foreshadows the big reveal in a later book: humans are magic fuel, and the Pilots&rsquo; Disputation was about the morality of that.</li>
<li>Medef has a waterstone.</li>
<li>Some villages in the Karaband rely on oases.</li>
<li>But there are a handful of waterstones that simply produce water endlessly (or teleport it from somewhere else - no-one knows).</li>
<li>The Aphsi can <em>drome</em> that there&rsquo;s a spirit of some sort in the waterstone powering it.</li>
<li>Someone tried to steal Qudef&rsquo;s waterstone several hundred years ago - it didn&rsquo;t go well for them.</li>
<li>Suresh does stage magic as well as the real thing.</li>
<li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an entertainer.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Has the social ease that Eimin craves.</li>
<li>Suresh lies to Eimin about magicians creating <em>nif</em> for the Other Hand.</li>
<li>Eimin&rsquo;s realization that his mother wouldn&rsquo;t do that to him is his character turning point.</li>
<li>As is his realization that Razi would…</li>
<li>Suresh believes the waterstone will let him trade Hediyeh&rsquo;s life to gain power.</li>
<li>People can drome that Suresh is going to betray her, but they think that means he&rsquo;s going to move on.</li>
<li>Hediyeh is already practicing being forlorn with her girlfriends…</li>
