<h1>Eimin</h1>



<section>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>People believe many different things about what happens when you die.
In the north,
the Ruudians spent six hundred years fighting undead monsters
who stripped the flesh from the bones of the living.
Sunshine and courage were often their only weapons,
so I suppose it is not surprising that they believe the souls of the righteous dead rise up to fuel the sun
so that it can shine down and keep us safe forever.</p>
<p>In the west,
on the other hand,
the farmers of the Regimental Kingdoms bury their dead to thank the earth for its bounty.
Just as flesh becomes soil, then barley, then flesh again,
so too,
they believe,
does the world fashion new spirits out of old.</p>
<p>The pirates of Ini Bantang and Barra Bantang believe in rebirth too,
except they believe we are reborn as ourselves to live our lives over again until we get them right.
This is why they say <em>im awa pha ta</em> whenever anything bad happens:
it means, &ldquo;Oh no, not this again.&rdquo;
And I met a tiger once who told me that when we die we&rsquo;re dead,
and that all the rest is just monkey foolishness.
Later,
though,
he asked me to ring a bell in memory of a friend of his,
so perhaps tigers can be foolish too.</p>
<p>But in the Karaband,
where I was born,
people believe that when they die they get to tell the story of their life one last time.
It doesn&rsquo;t matter then if it&rsquo;s filled with great deeds and poetry or simple and quiet.
All that matters is whether the person telling the story enjoys hearing it again.</p>
<p>We Karabandi think it&rsquo;s important to know what our stories are going to be like while we are still living them,
so every once in a while we go to someone and say,
&ldquo;This is the tale of me.&rdquo;
Sometimes it is best if the listener is a once-met stranger.
Other times the story will only make sense
if the listener is someone in particular—a loved one who has been wronged
or someone who remembers the sour-sweet taste of a particular grandmother&rsquo;s date cookies.</p>
<p>And sometimes,
when the story that needs telling is particularly difficult,
people seek out someone who is so good at listening that they have become famous for it.
You can find such listeners in every town or caravan.
We all have some other profession—cobbler, bookster, even thief—but our real calling is to hear people out.
We try not to judge, and we never repeat any of what we&rsquo;re told.
We just help people find out what their lives mean while they are still living them.</p>
<p>The other thing we listeners do is teach people how to tell their stories.
It can be hard if you&rsquo;ve never done it before—our lives teach us to hide our feelings,
even from ourselves,
and digging them up can be harder than mining glass.
I find the easiest way is to tell people my own story first,
so if there is any tea left in the pot…?
And perhaps a little more of the honey?
Thank you.</p>
<p>So: my name is Eimin, and this is the tale of me.
I was born in Medef, on the eastern shore of the Sea of Glass.
The people of Medef are not like people elsewhere.
They are Aphsi:
they can <em>drome</em> whether someone are happy or sad,
just as you can smell what is cooking before you go into the kitchen.
Aphsi mothers can tell that babies are hungry or tired before they start to cry.
Aphsi traders always know whether the person they are bargaining with is honest.
And Aphsi thieves are the best in the world:
they can <em>drome</em> when a street vendor is sleepy,
or whether a guard is paying more attention to the women washing their hair in the courtyard in front of him
than to the sound of footsteps on the roof over his head.</p>
<p>But not me.
I can&rsquo;t <em>drome</em>.
I am <em>nif</em>, like you.
I kicked and kicked when I was inside my mother because I couldn&rsquo;t <em>drome</em> her trying to soothe me.
Later,
when I was a baby,
I cried whenever my mother or father left the room
because I couldn&rsquo;t <em>drome</em> that they were just around the corner.</p>
<p>No one knows why the Aphsi are what they are.
Some people think we have always been that way.
Others blame it on the great spells of the Pilots&rsquo; last war,
and others—well, I will speak of that in time.</p>
<p>Let me first tell you what it was like to grow up <em>nif</em> among children who could <em>drome</em>.
They—the other children my age in Medef—used to play a game with me called &ldquo;surprise&rdquo;.
Sometimes,
when I was watching an anthill or practicing my letters,
they would sneak up behind me and shout, &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;
I would jump, and they would all laugh.
They couldn&rsquo;t imagine what it was like to not know that someone was behind them.
(Did I mention that Aphsi make good guards as well as good thieves?)</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t always mind being surprised:
at least it meant the other children were paying attention to me.
Mostly, though, it just made me angry.
I would tell them to stop, or run to my mother and get her to tell them.
They would, but only long enough for me to go back to my ants or my letters
so that they could sneak up behind me again.</p>
<p>I still have a scar on the ball of my thumb from the time Hediyeh and her friends surprised me
while I was carving a new pawn for Razi&rsquo;s chess set.
I was ten,
and the cut went right down to the bone.
Hediyeh had to go without food for a day as punishment,
and her parents gave my mother a spool of fine green thread to apologize,
but as far as Hediyeh and her friends were concerned that just made it my fault.</p>
<p>In a way, though, that cut is where my story begins.
That cut, and the talk I had with Razi that evening.
He came to our house just as my mother put the last stitch into my thumb.
The two of them sat for a while in the shade garden while I moped around under the awning out back,
picking at my new stitches and feeling sorry for myself.</p>
<p>When they were done talking,
Razi came to fetch me for a game of chess.
&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Let me have a look at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; I told him sullenly.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.
&ldquo;Show me,&rdquo; he insisted,
taking his embroidered chessboard out of its sleeve
and unrolling it on the ground between us.
I shrugged and held out my hand.
He inspected the four black stitches, then nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They used to do that to me too. Here, look.&rdquo;
He pulled up his right sleeve.
A beaded scar ran from his elbow to his wrist like a worm track on his skin.
&ldquo;I got so tired of them sneaking up on me that I climbed a date tree to get away from them.
I sat up there for, <em>la</em>, it must have been hours, just watching people come and go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed.
&ldquo;It was so peaceful that I fell asleep!
And <em>hup</em>, down I fell and broke my arm.
They had to give me poppy juice and cut it open to straighten out the bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d break my arm myself
if it would stop Hediyeh and the others from playing stupid tricks on me,&rdquo;
I grumbled.
I picked up a black pawn,
put my hands behind my back,
then held my fists out to him.</p>
<p>Razi didn&rsquo;t tap one.
Instead, he snapped his fingers against bad luck.
&ldquo;You should be careful what you ask for,&rdquo; he warned me.
&ldquo;<em>La</em>, and even more careful what you offer in return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew that tone of voice, and the look in his eyes.
All of a sudden I was even angrier than I had been when I cut my thumb.
What right did he have to pity me?
He was as <em>nif</em> as I was!
&ldquo;Are you going to choose or not?&rdquo; I asked, waving my fists above the board.</p>
<p>He reached out as if to choose a hand, then grabbed my wrists.
&ldquo;Open up,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ow!&rdquo; I opened my hands.
The black pawn I had taken from the chessboard lay in one.
The one I had spent the day carving lay in the other.</p>
<p>Razi laughed.
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll take white,&rdquo; he said, letting go of my wrists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>He grinned and pointed at the chessboard.
&ldquo;You forgot to pick up a white one,&rdquo; he told me.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to try to trick someone, <em>la</em>, you must plan more than one move ahead.&rdquo;
He scratched the side of his nose.
&ldquo;For example, think about—what&rsquo;s her name? Hediyeh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not,&rdquo; I said sourly.
I had spent hours carving that pawn…</p>
<p>He shook his head.
&ldquo;Just because you can&rsquo;t <em>drome</em>, it doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re deaf and blind.
Look at pocket mice.
They can&rsquo;t <em>drome</em> either, but have you ever tried to sneak up on one?
They&rsquo;re always listening, always sniffing the air.
If you listen that hard, and learn to pay attention, no-one will ever be able to sneak up on you.
And if you learn to be as still inside as a piece of glass,
then one day maybe you will be able to sneak up on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <em>how</em>?&rdquo; I was so frustrated that my voice broke.</p>
<p>Razi shrugged his shoulders and twisted his right hand around.
Just like that he had a short, sharp knife in his hand.
The blade was blackened, but sunlight glinted on its edge.
&ldquo;I can teach you, if you want,&rdquo;
he said quietly.</p>
<p>I stared at the knife like a pocket mouse staring at a snake.
Razi was more than just a wandering <em>nif</em> tinker,
and he was offering me far more than I had realized I was bargaining for.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p>Five years later Razi sat cross-legged in front of his tent in the lemon grove,
weighing feathers in the tin pans of a little balance.
&ldquo;Have you eaten?&rdquo; he asked without looking up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.
And I brought date bread for lunch.
<em>Umma</em> made it yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded.
&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;
He took a sand-brown feather from the balance and trimmed it with his knife.
&ldquo;Canteens are in the tent.
We&rsquo;ll need one each, and a spare.&rdquo;
The balance leveled.
Razi set the feather aside, then removed another from the bag beside him.</p>
<p>By the time I had filled the canteens and returned,
he had trimmed a dozen feathers to exactly the same weight.
He laid them flat in a folded square of paper so that they wouldn&rsquo;t be crushed.
&ldquo;Finish those later,&rdquo; he said, standing and stretching.
He stooped and pulled his bow case from his tent.
It was a long tube of hard brown leather as tall as I was.
A second tube, shorter and fatter, was his quiver.
Any feather on any arrow in that quiver would level the balance with any other.</p>
<p>The last thing he took was a dark green bottle wrapped in woven leather plaits.
Its stopper was a sword hilt with a plain leather grip.
Razi hung it on his left hip and grinned at me.
&ldquo;All set?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded.
My bow was slung over my shoulder in the padded cloth case my mother had made for it.
I had fifteen arrows, each with a barbed steel head, and a machete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Razi.
He clapped me on the shoulder.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go hunting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Razi led us south, skirting the ruins of the Pilots&rsquo; palace before turning inland toward the watchtower.
We played chess as we walked, each telling the other a move every fifty paces.
It&rsquo;s harder than it sounds:
not only do you have to keep the position in your head,
you have to think of a plan while you&rsquo;re counting paces.
It was fun,
but it was also another of Razi&rsquo;s exercises,
training me to keep track of time and distance while I was worrying about other things.</p>
<p>Time and distance are what the desert is about.
How far am I travelling?
When will I run out of water?
After Razi said, &ldquo;Checkmate,&rdquo; time and distance filled my thoughts.
How much longer would I stay in Medef?
How far could I go when I left?
The furthest I&rsquo;d ever been was Uef.
It was a tenth the size of Medef, just thirty families living around a spring three days away.
I wanted to see Ossisswe, and Ruuda, and Ini Bantang, and, oh, the whole world.
I wanted to see what a city looked like, a city full of <em>nif</em> like me.
I wanted to have adventures
so that I could come back to Medef to tell stories
and have girls like Hediyeh blush and giggle when I walked by,
the way they blushed and giggled when <em>nif</em> traders passed through.</p>
<p>I put one foot in front of the other, taking four steps for every three of Razi&rsquo;s.
The sun was half-way to noon when Razi turned east.
We circled around the watchtower hill so that we could come at it from the side closest to the Sea of Glass.
I tried to figure out his plan while we walked.
We would reach the tower mid-afternoon.
That didn&rsquo;t make sense: at that time of day, the breeze would carry our scent straight to the gargoyles.
Unless…</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>La</em>, am I to be bait?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>Razi shook his head.
&ldquo;No, I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We reached the beach an hour later.
It was an eerie place.
A thousand years of dry wind had scoured most of the sand away,
leaving a glass shelf that rippled with the shape of ancient waves.
Pieces had cracked and broken over the years,
littering the rock below with sharp-edged shards that could cut even the sturdiest sole.</p>
<p>Razi pointed.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a path down there by three rocks that look like a mother goat and two kids.
Do you know it?&rdquo;
I nodded.
&ldquo;Work your way up behind them.
I&rsquo;ll come at them from below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded again.
&ldquo;How will I know when you&rsquo;re ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grinned.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took me half an hour to get in position.
I moved from rock to bush,
never taking more than a dozen steps at once,
scanning the sky for slow-circling wings before picking my way to the next bit of cover.
I tried to keep my mind clear, to think only about the next few steps.
I was just a pocket mouse—no,
not even that,
just a wind-blown scrap of tumbleweed.</p>
<p>I was about five hundred paces from the watchtower when the first gargoyle launched herself into the air.
She didn&rsquo;t start flying right away.
Instead,
she plummeted earthward down the side of the tower for a moment to build up speed,
then snapped her wings open with a <em>crack</em>
and began spiralling back into the sky on an updraft.</p>
<p>I crouched behind the eroded remains of an old wall and slipped my bow out of its case.
I had waxed its string that morning when I was unable to sleep.
There, in the moment, I cursed the faint smell of honey that still lingered.
I slipped one loop into the catch at the bottom end of the bow,
braced it against my foot,
then bent it and hooked the other end of the string in place in a single motion
the way Razi had taught me.</p>
<p>I swallowed a mouthful of water and set my canteen down in the wall&rsquo;s narrow shadow.
I still had some date bread,
but I couldn&rsquo;t have eaten it then for its weight in pewter.
Instead I pulled the drawstrings at my wrists and ankles tight
so that my sleeves and pantlegs wouldn&rsquo;t catch on anything.</p>
<p>The second female launched herself from the tower.
As she rose to follow the first one
I slipped around the end of the ruined wall
and sprinted to the candelilla bush I&rsquo;d chosen as my next patch of cover.
I had hunted jackrabbits and sand gulls this way,
watching for the moments when my prey looked away,
inching closer a few paces each time.</p>
<p>Suddenly one of the gargoyles stooped, yipping at the other.
My breath caught.
It must be Razi.
I slipped two arrows from my quiver, put one between my teeth, and raised my head.</p>
<p>The third gargoyle, the male, took wing just as I looked up.
His wingspan was twice that of the females,
and his voice boomed instead of shrieking when he answered their call.
He flapped its wings to gain height.
The two females circled him as he climbed, all three calling to each other.</p>
<p>Razi broke cover and ran straight for the tower,
holding his bow in both hands like a spear for balance.
One of the females screeched and plummeted at him, arms outstretched.
Razi threw himself sideways at the last moment,
rolled over,
and came up on one knee to fire an arrow I hadn&rsquo;t even seen him draw.
It punched through the taut skin of the gargoyle&rsquo;s wing.</p>
<p>The other female swooped in behind her,
herding Razi toward the waiting male who would make the kill.
I sighted,
leading her,
time and distance made reflex by long hours of practice.</p>
<p>Razi ran again toward the tower again.
The second female cut across his path to cut him off.
He checked himself so that she overshot,
but the male was right behind her.
Razi jabbed at him with his bow.
The male stumbled in the air as it hit his wing,
one taloned foot raking Razi&rsquo;s scalp.</p>
<p>I fired my first arrow as the male started to climb.
It passed harmlessly behind him.
I pulled another from my quiver.
I could taste the one between my teeth,
my snapshot arrow.</p>
<p>There was blood on Razi&rsquo;s face.
He had two arrows out himself, one in his teeth, one strung.
As the first female dove a second time, he fired, drew, fired again.
The second shot hit her shoulder, cutting some vital muscle or tendon.
She tumbled sideways as her wing crumpled.</p>
<p>The male bellowed five stories above Razi&rsquo;s head.
I drew, exhaled, and let fly.
My arrow hit him square in the chest.
The impact knocked him sideways in the air.
My snapshot arrow struck his leg a moment later,
but I think he was already dead.
He turned over once as he fell.</p>
<p>The second female shrieked and banked away.
I saw Razi aim, then lower his bow.
She was too far away and moving too fast.</p>
<p>I ran to him as he wiped blood from his face with his sleeve.
&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>He glared at his sleeve as if blaming it for being stained.
&ldquo;No. Where&rsquo;s the spare canteen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have it,&rdquo; I said, pointing.
He turned his glare on me.
Then his look softened and he chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>La</em>, so I do.&rdquo;
He handed me his bow, unstoppered the canteen, and splashed some water onto his face.
&ldquo;Gaaah… I&rsquo;m a mess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something rustled behind me.
I whirled around.
The female that Razi had shot had struggled to her feet.
Her right wing hung uselessly at her side.
She chittered,
clutching feebly at the arrow that had passed through the complicated double joint
where arm and wing joined body.</p>
<p>Razi wiped some more blood from his face.
&ldquo;Here, give me that.&rdquo;
He took his bow back from me and drew an arrow.
The female just stood there on her short, bandy legs and watched with all-too-human eyes
as Razi sighted carefully and put an arrow through her heart.</p>

<section>
<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p>We walked back to the lemon grove in somber silence,
leaving the gargoyles&rsquo; bodies where they were to feed the desert.
They had been taking Grappa Uzman&rsquo;s goats.
He had suggested building a fire in the base of the tower to drive them away,
but Razi had said no,
they would just come back when the smoke was gone.
And anyway,
how would we fuel the fire?
Nothing near the tower would burn—did <em>sri</em> Uzman really want
to spend a week carrying loads of dried camel dung?</p>
<p>If someone else had asked that,
Grappa Uzman would have puffed up his chest and said yes,
he would do it.
Then one of his daughters would put her hand on his arm and gentled him
the way he gentled his goats when storms came.
But somehow,
coming from Razi,
the words made the idea seem so silly that they both laughed.
I was trying to figure out how Razi did that,
but it was proving harder to learn than the bow.</p>
<p>The sun was down by the time we reached the hill above the palace.
The moon hung low over the Sea of Glass,
a mottled diamond whose light turned the frozen waves into irregular bands of light and shadow.
Beneath us, the Pilots&rsquo; ancient stronghold glistened
as if it had been painted with teardrops.
Music still rose faintly from its walls
a thousand years and more after its builders had destroyed themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; Razi said, pointing.
At first I didn&rsquo;t see anything,
but then motion caught my eye.
A sandy desert hare stood on his haunches,
sniffing the wind,
while its tribe snuffled and nibbled among the eucalyptus trees that grew next to the palace walls.
I saw a splash in the aqueduct behind them as a fish jumped for a night fly.
The hares froze,
ready to scatter,
then returned to their search for dinner,
the moment already forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want help?&rdquo; I asked,
gesturing at the bandage wrapped around Razi&rsquo;s head.
He nodded, and we started down the hill.</p>
<p>The aqueduct ran from the center of the palace all the way to the village.
It was rough-edged sandstone,
human work,
and seemed half-finished compared to the smooth curved sparkle of the palace.
A square pool bulged out of the aqueduct&rsquo;s side every hundred strides or so.
I filled our canteens at the first of these
as Razi unwrapped his bandage and handed it to me.
Splashing some water on its end, I dabbed at the gash the gargoyle had given him,
jumping only slightly when another little fish went <em>ploop</em> beside us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>La</em>, that will do,&rdquo; Razi eventually said.
He fingered the gash&rsquo;s edges gingerly.
&ldquo;How does it look?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like someone tried to open up your head.&rdquo;
I rolled up the bandage—we would boil it clean later—and yawned.</p>
<p>Razi grinned. &ldquo;It is past your bedtime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded.
It had been a long day.
We picked up our gear and trudged up to Razi&rsquo;s tent in the lemon grove.
Their blossoms gave the air a sharp,
clean edge.</p>
<p>A clay pot held closed with twine sat in wait.
Undoing the knot, Razi lifted the lid and sniffed.
&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo;
Goat stew with chilis and pomegranates—one of Grappa Uzman&rsquo;s many daughters or granddaughters
must have brought it as payment for the day&rsquo;s work.
Razi held it out to me.</p>
<p>I shook my head.
&ldquo;<em>Umma</em> will be waiting.&rdquo;
My mother always stayed up when I was out with Razi.
I knew because our neighbors complained that her worrying kept them awake.</p>
<p>Razi set the pot down and raised his palms to me.
&ldquo;You did well today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not well enough.&rdquo;
The whole way home,
I&rsquo;d been thinking about missing my first shot.</p>
<p>He clapped me on the shoulder.
&ldquo;Yes, well enough.
Now <em>la</em>, get some sleep.
We&rsquo;ll talk tomorrow.&rdquo;
He pushed me gently toward home.</p>
<p>I read once that the name &ldquo;Aphsi&rdquo; comes from
an old Thindi phrase <em>aph e sessi</em>, meaning, &ldquo;the quiet people&rdquo;.
If you were to walk through Medef after dark,
you would understand why.
Most of the conversations people surround themselves with
don&rsquo;t really convey any information.
Their purpose is reassurance:
you are safe, your friends are here.</p>
<p>Aphsi don&rsquo;t need that.
They can <em>drome</em> whether all is well or not.
There was a drum in the village square to sound the alarm
in case of bandits or fire,
but most of the villagers would never think to use it.
The only sounds that night as I walked home were the goats,
the birds,
and Jephel playing the flute.</p>
<p>He and Mureya were sitting on an old palm log people used as a bench.
He broke off when he caught sight of me and waved.
I waved back,
not breaking stride,
but then he asked,
&ldquo;How did it go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sighed under my breath.
&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;
He shuffled sideways to make room for me,
not noticing the uncomfortable look on Mureya&rsquo;s face.
She could <em>drome</em> that I didn&rsquo;t want to stop and talk—not with Jephel, anyway..</p>
<p>But Jephel was <em>nif</em> like me, and he wanted to know the details.
There had been three?
And we&rsquo;d killed them all?
Oh, but Razi was hurt?
He spoke so slowly that I couldn&rsquo;t help but interrupt every third sentence.
He didn&rsquo;t seem to mind,
but Jephel never seemed to mind anything:
not his chores,
or the teasing of the other children,
or the names they had called him when his parents apprenticed him to the village butcher.
The only time I&rsquo;d ever seen him angry was
when Hediyeh and some of the other girls teased Mureya for holding his hand.
I don&rsquo;t know what they <em>dromed</em>,
but they never did it again.</p>
<p>I finally ran out of patience.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s been a long day, and <em>umma</em> will be wondering where I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, of course.&rdquo;
He ducked his head.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure everyone will be pleased that you took care of it.&rdquo;
He laughed.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like I could have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;
I raised a hand and hurried away.
Behind me,
he started playing again,
a slow love song that the girls always asked for.</p>
<p>My mother was waiting for me at the door with a soft smile on her face.
&ldquo;We got them,&rdquo; I said unnecessarily.
She nodded and held up my festival <em>deel</em>
to show me that she had finished sewing new cuffs on the sleeves,
then set it aside to give me a quick hug.</p>
<p>I dropped my gear and sat on a pillow on the floor,
reaching up to take the bowl of rice and peppers she handed me.
Ten minutes later I was asleep on the slat bed
in the curtained alcove that had been mine since I turned ten.
My mother had put fresh sprigs of mint and lemon under my pillow.
I think I dreamed of desert hares, and of moonlight on the Sea of Glass,
but after so many years it is hard to remember.</p>
<p>My mother shook me awake.
&ldquo;Razi wants you.&rdquo;
Her voice was soft and urgent.
&ldquo;Now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was an hour before dawn.
I dipped my fingers in the washbowl and ran them through my hair,
slipped my <em>deel</em> over my head,
and hurried out the door with my sandals still in my hand.
A moment later I doubled back to grab my bow
and the pack I had carried the day before.</p>
<p>A dayglass lantern cast dull orange light over two dozen people
in the village square.
I didn&rsquo;t need to be able to <em>drome</em> to know they were worried.
Razi had taken the bandage off his head.
The gash was already scabbed over,
and not for the first time,
I wondered about how quickly he healed.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed at a bald man in the center of the crowd
I had never seen before.
&ldquo;He says he is from a caravan heading to Ossisswe.
They were attacked by bandits,
and lost half of their livestock and most of their water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Razi gave a quick, angry jerk of his head.
&ldquo;<em>La</em>, that is my thought also.
They need help to round up what&rsquo;s left of their animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fear and anger bloomed and twined together in my gut.
&ldquo;Which would empty out the village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Razi nodded again.
&ldquo;<em>La</em>, just so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grappa Uzman broke off talking to the stranger and beckoned us over.
Jephel was there,
and Yassen the butcher,
and Yassen&rsquo;s twin brother Kirash who did whatever chores people would give him
and drank too much—all the village <em>nif</em>.
&ldquo;Here is Dudir uy-Armaq,&rdquo; Grappa Uzman said,
introducing the stranger to us in the formal way:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Razibendra uy-Ossisswe,&rdquo; Razi replied, raising his palms.
Up close,
the stranger was younger than I had thought—no more than eighteen.
His head was shaved,
not bald,
and his bare arms were as thick as my thighs.</p>
<p>Dudir raised his palms in return,
then grasped Razi&rsquo;s hand in the city way.
&ldquo;My father told me to look for you.
He said you could help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>La</em>, if I can.&rdquo;
Razi turned to Grappa Uzman and raised his voice so everyone could hear.
&ldquo;With your leave, grappa, I will take Kirash and half a dozen to find their animals.
Everyone else should stay here and keep watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half a dozen?&rdquo; Dudir&rsquo;s dismay made him sound angry.
&ldquo;We lost two hundred goats last night!
We&rsquo;ll never find them all with just half a dozen people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Razi grinned. &ldquo;Half a dozen <em>Aphsi</em>,&rdquo; he corrected.</p>
<p>Two minutes later they were on their way out of the village
and Yassen, Jephel, and I were on the roof of the bakery.
Yassen had fetched his bow—like me, he had been taught to use it when he was young.
Jephel had been taught too,
but had never amounted to more than a danger to himself.
There was nothing wrong with his eyes,
though,
or with his patience.
If the lion and her bandits came within a hundred strides of any villager, they would know.
Our job was to spot them if they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yassen nudged me with his elbow and passed me a stoppered jug of lemon water.
I took a sip and passed it to Jephel,
my eyes on the hills south and east of the village.
The sun was just coming up,
casting long autumn shadows tinged green-blue at the edges.
If anything moved, we would—</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; Yassen said flatly, pointing.
I looked north.
Nothing, nothing…I saw it,
a dark outline that changed shape as it moved.
I counted three, four, and then a fifth,
larger,
on four legs instead of two.
It was the lion.
From this distance I couldn&rsquo;t see the scar on her shoulder,
but I knew it was her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pass me a rag,&rdquo; Yassen ordered.
Silently,
Jephel handed him a scrap of cotton cloth.
As Yassen wound it around the head of an arrow,
Jephel uncorked the brown bottle Yassen had &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; from his brother.
The sharp smell that came from it was the evil twin of the lemon water&rsquo;s tang.</p>
<p>Yassen splashed some of the alcohol on the rag, then cursed.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t bring any matches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had some, wrapped in waxed paper in my <em>deel</em>,
along with a sewing needle and a toothpick.
A scratch and a touch later,
the rag on the arrow was alight.</p>
<p>Yassen set it carefully on the string, drew, and let fly.
The flame fluttered and died before the arrow arced down
to strike an innocent patch of candelilla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they saw it?&rdquo; Jephel asked.</p>
<p>The morning shadows were already shorter than they had been,
but knowing where to look,
I saw the bandits slipping away into the desert.
&ldquo;She saw it,&rdquo; I said.
Lions,
even Gifted ones,
only attack when they have the element of surprise.
We would stay on the roof and watch
in case she and her humans were desperate enough to try without that,
but the excitement was over.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<p>The caravan straggled into Medef an hour later,
trailing an ochre plume of dust.
From the bakery roof,
I counted ten carts and thirty people:
eleven on camels,
six in carts,
and the rest on foot.
A short string of pack camels trailed behind the last cart
in brightly-colored harnesses.
As I watched,
the knots holding a round-cornered box on one camel&rsquo;s back came loose.
It tumbled to the ground and broke open,
spilling dark cloth bags holding buttons or spices onto the trail.
A woman in a red and gray <em>deel</em> rushed over
and beat the camel&rsquo;s flank with her palms to get it to stop,
cursing when it didn&rsquo;t even break stride.</p>
<p>One cart stood out from the rest.
It was drawn by a pair of burros
instead of one of the humpless camels the other carters used,
and its spoked wheels would have come up to my armpits.
Whatever occupied it was securely wrapped in dark blue canvas
held in place with enough rope to rig a tents.
Its driver sat with his back against his cargo
and the burros&rsquo; reins loose in his hand.
He wore darkly-patterned <em>deel</em> and a bright yellow turban,
which meant either that he was from Ossisswe,
or that he was a scholar,
or that he liked the color yellow.</p>
<p>I nudged Yassen with my elbow.
He sat up and scratched his beard with both hands.
Jephel glanced at him,
then at me,
then went back to watching the hills where we had seen the lion and her thieves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry looking bunch, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; Yassen said sourly.
He was right:
when Razi had said &ldquo;caravan&rdquo;,
I had expected fifty carts or more.
Medef saw two that size each year,
one for the examination festival in Ossisswe,
the other three months later
when merchants from the Salt Coast who were willing to risk the deep desert
came through on their way to Coriandel.
They brought dayglass, chocolate, silk, mace, coral, fine leather, and books.
Looking at the tired faces below me,
I wondered if anyone in this &ldquo;caravan&rdquo; could even read.</p>
<p>Yassen stood and stretched.
The sun was a handspan past noon,
and the heat made the bakery roof feel like the ovens beneath us.
&ldquo;I need to fiss,&rdquo; he grumbled,
lifting the palmed roof-hatch 
and clambering down the ladder into the cool dark below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we get some water?&rdquo; Jephel asked.
He held up his canteen and shook it to show it was empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send some up.&rdquo;
The closing hatch muffled his words.</p>
<p>Jephel sighed.
&ldquo;No he won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said philosophically,
long accustomed to people forgetting about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here.&rdquo;
I tossed my canteen at him.
Being thirsty would be better than listening to him not complain.</p>
<p>As the caravan approached,
a handful of villagers busied themselves in the posting yard.
Palm tree logs stood in a rough grid, twelve strides to a side.
Ropes were quickly strung on the pulleys hanging from their tops.
Squares of canvas,
each big enough to cover the roof I was sitting on,
were laid across the ropes and hauled into place
to form a single great awning over the fairground.
The southern and eastern sides were blocked by more canvas
to keep out the hot afternoon wind.</p>
<p>A hundred strides away,
four men strained to raise the sluice gate at the end of the aqueduct.
Anywhere else in the Karaband,
they would have chanted, &ldquo;<em>Heph…ho!</em>&rdquo; to stay in time.
But they were Aphsi,
so they worked in silence.</p>
<p>The sluice gate finally gave in with a screech of stone on stone.
Water poured from the aqueduct into the pipe that led to the fairground,
where it splashed into a short trough that in turn spilled into a longer one.
People would wash their hands and food in the first,
while animals would drink from the second.</p>
<p>Two sharp whistles cut through the bustle.
I shielded my eyes with my hand
as Razi and the villagers who had gone with him
came over the horizon in the midst of a hundred or more goats.
There wouldn&rsquo;t be any stragglers:
if a goat was alive,
an Aphsi would have <em>dromed</em> it and brought it in.</p>
<p>The caravan&rsquo;s lead cart reached the stone gate that marked the edge of Medef.
Dudir sat on the front bench beside an older man with the same brawny arms,
eagle-beak nose,
and shaven head
who I took to be his father.
Grappa Uzman and Granna Efiyeh raised their palms to the pair in welcome.</p>
<p>A few strides further on,
Hediyeh and some of the other girls stood in a cluster,
their hands tucked politely in their sleeves
and their faces shadowed by the hoods of their <em>deels</em>.
I watched Hediyeh&rsquo;s head turn to follow the cart as it passed her.
As Dudir turned to look back,
something prickled up my spine.
I didn&rsquo;t have to be able to <em>drome</em> to recognize
the calculating look in Hediyeh&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>Before I could think any more about it
the cart with the strange cargo caught my eye again.
Karabandi are proud of the fact that no two <em>deels</em> are exactly alike.
We lengthen them, shorten them, add pockets in common or unlikely places,
or reinforce the shoulders if we frequently carry heavy loads.
Over time,
every <em>deel</em> learns from its wearer how to do its job better,
and every Karabandi learns how to read a person&rsquo;s life from their <em>deel</em>.</p>
<p>The driver in the yellow turban
wore a <em>deel</em> like none I had ever seen.
The pattern on it was actually black and blue stains.
A wide belt was sewn around the waist to support the weight of
whatever jingled and clanked in the double pockets on each side.
There were more small pockets on the sleeves,
though these seemed empty.
A long tear in the side had been carefully stitched shut.
I knew Razi would ask me later what his trade was,
but I had no idea.</p>
<p>He chose a spot in the furthest corner of the tented market.
Whatever was in his cart was obviously heavy:
he had tied it securely right over the axle
to stop its weight from tipping the cart.
As he scratched his burros&rsquo; ears
and fed them handfuls of barley
he noticed me studying him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>La</em>, young sir,&rdquo; he said,
tying the feed bag shut and tossing it onto the cart seat,
&ldquo;Will you help a traveler?&rdquo;
He spoke in a pleasant tenor,
rolling his R&rsquo;s and slanting his Th&rsquo;s like an Ossisswean.
When I nodded,
he raised his voice.
&ldquo;Dudir? A moment, if you would?&rdquo;
The brawny young man I took to the be the lead carter&rsquo;s son ambled over.</p>
<p>The man in the yellow turban turned back to me.
&ldquo;Here is Suresh ul-Ossisswe,&rdquo; he said, raising his palms.</p>
<p>I raised mine.
&ldquo;Here is Eimin ul-Medef,&rdquo; I replied.
He raised an eyebrow—at my age,
I should have introduced myself as someone and someone&rsquo;s—but made no comment.
Instead,
he reached into the cart and began passing me cloth-wrapped packages
to stack on the shelves behind me.</p>
<p>I knew their wait instantly.
They were books, dozens of them.
My stomach suddenly rumbled.
&ldquo;Would you like me to unwrap them?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>Suresh shook his head.
&ldquo;<em>La</em>, thank you, but no.
I just want them out of the way so we can get the press off the cart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The press?&rdquo; I repeatedly stupidly.</p>
<p>He pointed at the irregular shape squatting in his cart.
&ldquo;My printing press.&rdquo;
The look on my face made him laugh good-naturedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re another one, are you?&rdquo;
Dudir said as he joined us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another what?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>He snorted.
&ldquo;Never mind.
Let&rsquo;s get this weeping thing on the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Getting it down meant chocking the wheels,
undoing several knots,
and then looping the ropes around the press again.
With Dudir&rsquo;s weight on one harness post,
and mine and Suresh&rsquo;s on the other,
we tilted the cart back and paid out the ropes
to get the press on solid ground.
The whole process took about half an hour,
by which time the sun was down
and the smell of barbecued goat had turned my stomach into a hard knot of hunger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phah!&rdquo;
Dudir stretched until something in his back popped.
&ldquo;Glad that&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;
He undid the broad belt of his <em>deel</em> and slipped it over his head
to reveal a sleeveless shift and long, loose pants.</p>
<p>I heard giggles behind me.
Hediyeh and the other girls were supposed to be helping make the welcome dinner,
but they had taken advantage of the bustle
to slip away for an early look at what the caravaneers had brought.
With so many <em>nif</em> about,
it would be a while before their parents noticed they were gone.</p>
<p>Dudir grinned at them as he shook out his <em>deel</em> and put it back on.
He was as muscular as an ox.
<em>And probably as smart,</em> I thought sourly.</p>
<p>Suresh clapped him on the shoulder.
&ldquo;Thank you again,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;And you as well,&rdquo; he continued to me.
He gestured at the bundles of books sitting patiently in the stall beside his cart.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d like to borrow anything for the night…?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I heard another giggle.
I&rsquo;m sure the girls could <em>drome</em> how much I wanted
to take them all back to my alcove and pore through them,
sounding out the words I did not know and wondering about the people who had written them.
&ldquo;Thank you, but it is late,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;Perhaps tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He inclined his head.
&ldquo;<em>La</em>, as you wish.&rdquo;
He clapped me on the shoulder and headed for the barbecue pit.
I hesitated a moment,
then turned for home.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<p>Caravans never sell much in Medef.
At least,
they didn&rsquo;t when I was growing up,
and I don&rsquo;t imagine it has changed since I left.
The village does not have the bronze mines or dayglass quarries of other Aphsi villages,
and while its lemons are delicious,
they do not travel well.</p>
<p>What it <em>does</em> have is clean, cool water.
Thanks to the waterstone embedded in its floor,
the pool that takes up one corner of the Pilots&rsquo; palace is never empty.
Magicians have argued for centuries about whether the stone makes water
or somehow transports it from somewhere else.
Thirsty caravaneers don&rsquo;t care.
All that matters to them is that their animals can drink
and they can refill their barrels
no matter how bad the desert heat is.</p>
<p>I found Suresh the next morning on the hill that divided the village from the palace.
He was sitting in the shadow cast by a worn stone pillar
with a stick of drawing charcoal in his hand and a notebook open in his lap.
I had sketched the palace several times from almost the exact same spot.</p>
<p>He smiled as I approached and gestured at the palace.
&ldquo;It is remarkable, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded the way Razi had taught me to.
&ldquo;Do you think they&rsquo;ll ever come back?&rdquo; I asked,
immediately regretting my abruptness.</p>
<p>He chuckled.
&ldquo;<em>La</em>, who can say?
Dead, sleeping underground, gone to the moon—I have books that claim all of these.
There are even some who claim they never actually left,
but rather walk among us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I squatted on my heels a couple of strides away from him.
&ldquo;Why would they do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His smile reminded me of Razi&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;Why did they do anything?&rdquo;
He scrambled to his feet (less elegantly than Razi would have)
and tucked his notebook into his <em>deel</em>.
&ldquo;Would you like to give me a tour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had never been a tour guide before,
but I did my best to remember what I had learned in the village school
and later from Razi.
Nothing was left of the Pilots&rsquo; elaborate garden after so many centuries
except the paths and stone benches.
Some of the dayglass embedded in the walls had been pried out,
but only some.
Bad things tended to happen to people who disturbed
what had once belonged to the Pilots,
or so the stories said.</p>
<p>Suresh stopped to admire a mosaic twice his height.
&ldquo;Have you ever drawn this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded, then caught myself.
&ldquo;What makes you think I draw?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrugged.
&ldquo;Your friend Hediyeh told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;
I digested that for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>La</em>, it reminds me of one in Ossisswe,&rdquo;
he continued,
as if not noticing my silence.
&ldquo;Here, look.&rdquo;
He took out his notebook,
flipped through it,
and then offered it to me.</p>
<p>The paper was finer than any I had ever held,
and the leather binding was as supple as my own skin.
I didn&rsquo;t notice that right away, though.
I was too entranced by the drawing.
He had used three colors of charcoal and blended the results somehow
to capture the shadow on the ground before a freestanding section of wall
decorated with a mosaic whose angles and swirls were cousins of those beside us.
I&rsquo;m surprised my stomach didn&rsquo;t rumble at the sight.</p>
<p>He laughed at the expression on my face,
but his laugh didn&rsquo;t sting like those of Hediyeh and her friends.
It was the laugh of someone who knew what it was to read a story
or look at a drawing
and want to be able to create something like it.
&ldquo;<em>La</em>, so let me offer you a bargain,&rdquo; he said,
still smiling.
&ldquo;You tell me what it feels like to <em>drome</em>,
and I&rsquo;ll show you how to shade colors like I did there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everything I was feeling suddenly tasted like ashes in my mouth.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I said curtly,
handing his book back to him.</p>
<p>The smile dropped from his face.
&ldquo;My apologies if I have offended,&rdquo; he said,
bowing his head slightly.
&ldquo;I merely wished to—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <em>can&rsquo;t</em>,&rdquo; I interrupted.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <em>nif</em>.
I can&rsquo;t drome any more than you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;
He gave me another slight bow,
in sympathy rather than as an apology.
&ldquo;In that case,
I apologize for being thoughtless.
It must be difficult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;
All of a sudden I wanted to be somewhere else.
&ldquo;I should get back and do my chores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
He hesitated.
&ldquo;My offer stands.
If you would like,
I would be happy to show you how I did the shading in that sketch.
Once your chores are done, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe.
Thank you,&rdquo; I added belatedly.</p>
<p>I waved to Grappa Uzman as I walked back through the lemon grove.
Medef was quiet:
most people were inside to stay out of the heat,
and the few who were out only spoke when necessary.
The posting yard was quiet too,
though I heard voices from the upper floor of the hostel
where caravaneers and other travelers stayed.</p>
<p>Razi was waiting for me at my house with two strangers.
&ldquo;<em>La</em>, there you are,&rdquo; he said,
standing and straightening his <em>deel</em>.
&ldquo;I was starting to wonder if the lion had eaten you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>That&rsquo;s not funny,</em> I thought,
but, &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; was what I said.
I tried not to stare at his companions.
One,
a woman,
had the same lean build and dark skin as Razi,
but her face was round where his was narrow.
The other was taller and broad-shouldered,
with curiously light eyes.
As he nodded in greeting,
I noticed that he was missing part of his right ear.</p>
<p>Razi waited a moment and then cleared his throat.
&ldquo;I believe your mother is at her sister&rsquo;s.
Perhaps you could invite us in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; I repeated.
I untied the door and held it open for them.</p>
<p>Razi waved the others ahead of him and took me by the shoulder.
&ldquo;Just be yourself,&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>
<p><em>Who else would I be?</em> I wondered,
but didn&rsquo;t have a chance to ask.</p>
<p>They sat cross-legged on the carpet cushions while I made tea.
The pot had been my father&rsquo;s wedding gift to my mother,
and was the finest thing she owned.
The mis-matched glass cups seemed slightly embarrassed to be set beside it,
but I told myself I was the only one who cared.
I poured,
offered date sugar,
and then cradled my cup between my palms
as I waited for Razi to explain what in the saints&rsquo; names this was about.</p>
<p>He sipped his tea and set it down.
&ldquo;I have told my colleagues about your progress,&rdquo;
he started without preamble.
&ldquo;They wanted to meet you for themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded as if I understood.
If you are patient and quiet,
the rabbit will come out of its burrow.</p>
<p>The woman spoke first.
Had I been enjoying my lessons?
Why?
What was the most useful thing I had learned?
What had been the most surprising?
Did I ever show the other children in the village things I had learned?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
I shook my head at that one.
&ldquo;They would just make fun of me.&rdquo;
Why had I said that out loud?
And why did my tongue feel strange?</p>
<p>I look down at my teacup,
then at Razi.
He met my gaze without blinking.</p>
<p>The man with half an ear took over the questioning.
What did I do when the others made fun of me?
Did I ever think about getting back at them?
Oh come, surely I must have.
No?
What about the other <em>nif</em> boy, Jephel—did I feel embarrassed being around him?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what Razi put in my tea,
or how he got it into my cup without me noticing,
but I told them things I had never told anyone before.
Razi stayed silent throughout,
but watched me and his colleagues like a gargoyle.</p>
<p>Finally,
the woman looked at him and nodded.
&ldquo;I have heard enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also,&rdquo;
the man said.
&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
They stood,
bowed to me—proper bows, not just nods—and left without another word.</p>
<p>Razi drew a small vial from the pocket of his <em>deel</em> and offered it to me.
&ldquo;<em>La</em>, put a drop in your tea.
It will clear your head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do to me?&rdquo;
I managed.</p>
<p>He shrugged.
For the first time since I had met him he seemed uncomfortable.
&ldquo;I apologize,
but we needed to be sure your answers were truthful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I drank,
then waited for my head to clear.
Once the strangeness had turned into a simple mild headache,
I stood.
&ldquo;Do you need anything else?&rdquo;
I asked bitterly.
&ldquo;If not, I have chores to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Razi sighed.
&ldquo;Eimin, have you ever wondered why people leave the Aphsi alone?
Why Coriandel and Ossiswe and Armaq have never sent their armies to conquer us?&rdquo;
He gestured at the door.
&ldquo;They are the reason.
<em>We</em> are the reason.
And if you are willing,
<em>la</em>,
you will be part of the reason too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stuffed my hands into my pockets but didn&rsquo;t reply.
I was angry about what had just happened,
and I had learned the hard way that
speaking in anger just gave me more things to be angry about.</p>
<p>Razi picked up his teacup and set it down again without drinking.
&ldquo;We are the Other Hand,&rdquo;
he said quietly.
&ldquo;Not the one you see,
not the one you watch—we are the other one.
We have an arrangement with Lady Kembe and some of her friends.
They make sure we are left alone,
and in exchange we do certain things for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of—hey!&rdquo;
Without warning he threw the serving platter at me.
I caught it without thinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those kinds of things,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;That is what I have been training you for,
and <em>la</em>,
now it is time for you to decide if you want the job or not.&rdquo;</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
<p>What do you do after a conversation like that?
What do you do when you have thought of yourself as less for as long as you can remember,
only to be told that there might be a place for you after all,
a place more meaningful than butchering livestock?
What do you do when someone tells you that your life has a purpose,
but it is one you did not choose?</p>
<p>I still do not have an answer.
What I <em>do</em> know is that if everyone around you can <em>drome</em> how you are feeling,
what you <em>shouldn&rsquo;t</em> do is be among them.</p>
<p>After trying and failing to concentrate on washing the pots and mending a chair,
I set my chores aside and headed for the posting yard.
Evening was approaching,
and the air was merely hot rather than stifling.
Most people were still indoors.
The few I passed gave me startled looks as they neared.</p>
<p>A woman scowled at me as the baby tucked into her <em>deel</em> started to cry.
&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; I muttered.
<em>It&rsquo;s not my fault,</em> I wanted to add,
but it was.
I stopped in the narrow shadow between the potter&rsquo;s shed and the bakery
and took deep, slow breaths to still myself.
Suddenly I snorted.
I was doing exactly what Razi had trained me to do
to hide myself from other Aphsi.</p>
<p>Other Aphsi…
Not <em>real</em> Aphsi.
I turned that thought over in my head.
Razi was respected and well-liked.
Everyone was always glad to see him,
not just my mother.
Could I have that?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;
I jumped and whirled around.</p>
<p>Hediyeh snickered.
I felt anger boil up inside me,
but she didn&rsquo;t flinch or run away
like other children had when I was younger.
Instead,
she smiled wickedly,
blew me a kiss,
and turned to walk away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to say hello to Dudir?&rdquo; I said to her back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; she replied over her shoulder.
&ldquo;Bet he doesn&rsquo;t jump like a rabbit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I should explain about Hediyeh.
Have you ever had very strong cheese,
or the fermented fish that the Ruudians are so fond of?
Both taste terrible at first,
and even at second or third,
but some people not only develop a liking for them,
they come to savor them.</p>
<p>Hediyeh was like that with other people&rsquo;s discomfort.
I don&rsquo;t know where or why it started,
but she took pleasure from the <em>deroma</em> of embarrassment or shame
the way some people enjoy sucking on pickled lemons
or chewing <em>sinachi</em> peppers.
She used to tease Jephel as well as me,
but once his voice deepened and his mustache started to come in,
he stopped reacting to her tricks and taunts.
That just left me as a target.</p>
<p>I have met other people like her over the years.
I wish I believed that none of their were happy,
but they seemed to enjoy the stories of their lives as much as anyone else.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t follow Hediyeh to the posting yard.
I just walked the same way because
it would have been humiliating to go around the long way
just because she had taken the shortcut that everyone in Medef used.
Sure enough,
Dudir was there under the canvas,
stripped to the waist as he repaired something on his father&rsquo;s cart.</p>
<p>At least,
that&rsquo;s what I think he had been doing.
By the time I got there he was talking to Hediyeh
while Layla and Yareh looked on.
The girls must have <em>dromed</em> me arriving,
but none of them looked my way
as I leaned against a post and pretended not to listen.</p>
<p>It turned out that Dudir was quite a traveler.
Coriandel, Ossisswe, Armaq: he knew them all.
Oh,
and he had been as far as Darp in the north and Thind to the east.
He and his father could have been rich by now if they had been willing to settle down,
but no, that wasn&rsquo;t for them.
Who could imagine being stuck in one place after life on the road?
It would be like prison.
&ldquo;No offense meant,&rdquo;
he added quickly.
&ldquo;I mean,
I&rsquo;m there&rsquo;s a lot to be said for putting down roots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>La</em>, the poor man,&rdquo;
Suresh said as he came to stand beside me.
&ldquo;Does he not realize they can <em>drome</em> he&rsquo;s lying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shrugged.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re used to it.
Most <em>nif</em> tell little lies all the time,&rdquo;
I went on as he raised his eyebrows.
&ldquo;Sometimes they—we don&rsquo;t realize it,
and most of the time we don&rsquo;t mean any harm by it,
but Aphsi can always tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm.&rdquo;
Suresh digested that for a moment.
&ldquo;I imagine that makes courtship quite complicated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I said.
I immediately regretted my tone,
but Suresh just chuckled.
I felt a bit of the tension between my shoulders ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>La</em>, come,&rdquo; he said,
clapping me on the shoulder.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what I have that you haven&rsquo;t seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer turned out to be &ldquo;everything&rdquo;.
There must have been two hundred books on the shelves beside his cart,
of which I had only ever met two or three.
A two-volume history of Thind,
a third volume devoted entirely to its sculpture,
five copies of a guide to the diseases of cattle,
a surgeon&rsquo;s handbook whose illustrations looked like
grown-up versions of the butchering notes that Jephel was painstakingly assembling,
and wonder of wonders,
a collection of hand-tinted architectural drawings of Coriandel
that was probably worth more than any two houses in Medef.</p>
<p>Suresh elbowed me.
&ldquo;You have an audience,&rdquo; he murmured.
I glanced at Dudir&rsquo;s stall.
He and Hediyeh were still talking
(or rather, he was still talking at Hediyeh),
but Layla and Yareh were looking at me and suppressing giggles
as they <em>dromed</em> my wonder and hunger.</p>
<p>I snapped the book of drawings closed and moved to replace it on the shelf.
Suresh put his hand out to stop me.
&ldquo;<em>La</em>, you can borrow it if you want.
No, please—it&rsquo;s a pleasure to find someone who appreciates it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hesitated a moment before shaking my head.
&ldquo;Thank you, but I should get back to my chores.&rdquo;
I hesitated again.
&ldquo;Could I come look at it again tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again his smile reminded me of Razi&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sun had just set by the time my mother got home.
I had washed the pots,
mended the chair,
swept our tiled floor,
and pulled half a dozen inepche beetles off the peppers growing in pots
in the little courtyard behind our house.
She handed me a trio of flatbreads
and some eggplants to slice, oil, and lay out on the hotstone.
I dressed them with basil and a little garlic
as she brushed flour out of her close-cropped hair.
We didn&rsquo;t talk:
she was tired,
and didn&rsquo;t need <em>droming</em> to know that I had things to say but wasn&rsquo;t ready to say them.</p>
<p>Once we were seated with our dinner and a fresh pot of mint tea
I told her about my day,
leaving out what Razi had told me about the Other Hand.
She nodded as she listened,
as she had learned to do that when I was little
so that I would know she was listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls are like that,&rdquo; she observed
when I reached the part about Hediyeh and the others in the posting yard.</p>
<p>I wiped the last of the oil and basil off my plate with a scrap of flatbread.
&ldquo;Were you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled.
&ldquo;Of course.
Your father was so eager to impress me.
He knew I knew, but that didn&rsquo;t stop him.
Or Kirash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed as what she <em>dromed</em> in me.
&ldquo;Yes, Kirash.
He gave me flowers once,
and asked if he could dance with me.
I said yes,
just to tease your father.
He wasn&rsquo;t always like he is now,&rdquo;
she added.</p>
<p>I shrugged and took her plate.
&ldquo;Have you asked the bookster if he wants an apprentice?&rdquo;
she asked suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;
I blinked at her.</p>
<p>Her expression was fond and sad at the same time.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not happy here.
Sometimes, yes, when you&rsquo;re with Razi,
but most of the time you are lonely and frustrated.
You love books.
It would be good for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt as though I had just looked down and realized I was on the edge of a cliff.
&ldquo;But what about you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood up and came over to me.
&ldquo;I just want you to be happy,&rdquo; she said,
going on her tiptoes to kiss my forehead.</p>
<p>I stood there for a moment feeling like a little child again.
&ldquo;I miss <em>appa</em>,&rdquo; I blurted.</p>
<p>She nodded.
&ldquo;Me too.
How about you make some more tea and we&rsquo;ll go sit for a bit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stars were tiny bright sparks over our heads
as we reclined in the canvas <em>ouref</em> seats on the roof.
A few neighbors were on their roofs as well.
Someone in the hostel started playing an oudh,
and then I heard Suresh singing
about how the cool mountain breeze reminded him of long-lost love.
My mother started humming along.
I joined in a moment later,
wishing with all my heart that the world would make sense some day.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<p>Granna Ferouz thumped our door drum the next morning.
The horizon was red, orange, and gold,
and the whippet larks that nested in the lemon grove
were trilling to each other from the rooftops,
enjoying the last few moments of night-time coolness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;
my mother asked as I rubbed sleep from my eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Storm,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;My knee tells me it&rsquo;ll be here by noon.&rdquo;
Medef&rsquo;s weatherwife didn&rsquo;t need to say any more.
My mother could <em>drome</em> how worried she was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Grappa Uzman need a hand with the goats?&rdquo; I asked,
stifling a yawn.</p>
<p>Granna Ferouz shook her head.
&ldquo;Help the caravaneers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The air was absolutely still as I trudged to the posting yard
with a bowl of cold <em>belila</em> in my stomach.
A dozen men and women were already at work,
taking down canvas awnings and tying them over wagons.
Wind-blown sand would still get into awkward places,
but at least there wouldn&rsquo;t be piles of it.</p>
<p>Somehow I wound up paired with Jephel.
He worked steadily and without complaint,
even though his bulk made him sweaty.
When I stopped to wipe my brow he nudged me and jerked his chin at one of the stalls.
&ldquo;What do you think of those?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I glanced at the bead necklaces the stallholder was stuffing back in padded sacks.
&ldquo;They look kind of cheap to me,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;
He sounded disappointed.
&ldquo;I was thinking of getting one for Mureya.
I don&rsquo;t have a <em>nowruz</em> present for her yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give her a chicken,&rdquo; I grunted,
lifting a roll of canvas.</p>
<p>He shook his head.
&ldquo;I did that last year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do it again.&rdquo;
I dropped the canvas in the back of the nearest wagon
and started unrolling it.</p>
<p>Jephel snorted.
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t work like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I said,
echoing what I had told Suresh the day before.
Jephel chuckled,
then held the other side of the canvas so I could tie it off.</p>
<p>The wind was humming through the stay lines by the time we were done.
Squinting against the dust,
we found seats in the trading hall that took up the ground floor of the hostel.
With the shutters closed,
the only light came from mismatched dayglass lamps.</p>
<p>Some people pillowed their heads in their arms and closed their eyes.
Others clustered around a board to watch Yassen and Dudir&rsquo;s father play hive
or took out knitting or mending to pass the time.
Granna Ferouz said that storms were stronger and more frequent
than they had been in her youth.
I didn&rsquo;t know if that was true.
All I knew was that it would be several hours before stepping outside
wouldn&rsquo;t feel like someone was scrubbing my skin with a rough brush.</p>
<p>There is only one sensible thing to do in a situation like that: sleep.</p>
<p>I woke with a start when someone thumped on the door drum.
The wind had died down while I dozed,
but the thick curtain hung in front of the door still billowed inward
as Razi pushed it aside.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the lion,&rdquo; he said,
lowering the <em>keffiyeh</em> that protected his face.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s coming for the goats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this?&rdquo; Yassen said disbelievingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>La</em>, yes, in this.&rdquo;
Razi nodded to me as Yassen and I stood,
then raised a hand as Jephel stood as well.
Jephel sat again,
relief and a hint of shame on his face.</p>
<p>The worst of the storm had passed
but still,
I was glad for my <em>deel</em> and Razi&rsquo;s spare goggles.
Yassen kept his hand on my shoulder as we made our way to his house
so that he could collect his own goggles.
He didn&rsquo;t bother with his bow.
Instead,
he took a pair of spears that were propped in the corner
and handed one to me.
When he raised his eyebrows,
Razi patted the dark green bottle that hung from his belt.</p>
<p>Medef kept its goats in a fenced yard near the lemon grove.
The caravan&rsquo;s goats were crowded in there now as well,
perhaps eighty animals in total huddled against one another
in two sturdy sheds.
&ldquo;What makes you think she&rsquo;s coming?&rdquo;
Yassen had to raise his voice to be heard over the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>La</em>, just a feeling,&rdquo;
Razi shouted back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You brought us out in this for a feeling?&rdquo;
Yassen demanded disbelievingly.</p>
<p>Razi shrugged.
&ldquo;I have strong feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We huddled against the fence,
which did nothing to stop the wind-blown sand stinging
every exposed piece of skin.
I didn&rsquo;t move until Razi&rsquo;s hand tightened on my arm.
I nudged Yassen.</p>
<p>The lion slunk out of the lemon grove
with two of her human minions beside her.
They were bundled up like us.
She moved as she always did,
her limbs loose and her back swaying slightly.
I had just a moment to be annoyed that the storm didn&rsquo;t seem to bother her
before Razi drew his sword from the bottle at his side.</p>
<p>It came out like honey syrup,
shaping itself into a sharp-edged quicksilver whip.
Under other circumstances I would have stopped to admire it,
or more truly,
to covet it.</p>
<p>Razi stepped out from behind the fence.
Yassen and I followed,
our spears raised.</p>
<p>The lion and her thieves halted a dozen strides away.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she growled,
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t expect to see you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>La</em>, and yet here I am.&rdquo;
Razi&rsquo;s strange blade swayed from side to side
like a cobra trying to decide whether or not to strike.</p>
<p>The taller of her thieves hefted his spear.
&ldquo;Let us take two and we&rsquo;ll be on our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yassen told him what he could do with that idea.
I filed his comment away for future use.
&ldquo;How about you just turn around and leave?&rdquo;
Razi suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; the lion rumbled.
&ldquo;Cubs are hungry.
We all are.&rdquo;
And then she charged,
her thieves two steps behind her.</p>
<p>Razi moved even as she did.
His sword lashed out,
stretching and thinning.
She dodged his first cut,
but his second caught her snout.
She snarled and danced sideways.</p>
<p>I was too busy parrying one of the thieves&rsquo; spears with my own
to see what happened next.
He was taller than me,
but not as strong or as well trained.
I knocked his point aside and jabbed to force him back,
then jabbed again before he could catch his balance.</p>
<p>Yassen grunted on my left.
I glanced at him just long enough to see that
his opponent had scored a hit on his arm.
I feinted at mine to keep him back,
then lunged at the man opposite Yassen.
As he turned to block my thrust,
Yassen&rsquo;s slid across his ribs.</p>
<p>The lion snarled again,
unable to get past Razi&rsquo;s blade.
&ldquo;Out!&rdquo; she ordered.
She turned and ran,
the two thieves behind her.</p>
<p>The whole fight had lasted no longer than ten slow breaths.
I let out my breath with a whoosh,
feeling suddenly limp as I always did after such excitement.
&ldquo;Let me have a look at that,&rdquo; I told Yassen.</p>
<p>He waved me off.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a scratch.&rdquo;
He spat on the ground, then looked at Razi.
&ldquo;They must really be desperate,
coming into town like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The goats&rsquo; panicked bleating cut off whatever reply Razi might have made.
His eyes widened.
With his sword still in his hand,
he swung himself over the fence and ran to the sheds.</p>
<p>The cursing that followed was colorful and in at least three languages.
&ldquo;What? What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Yassen demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>La</em>, I am an idiot, that is what.&rdquo;
Razi stalked back to the fence, stiff with anger.
&ldquo;She was only here to distract us.
Someone else must have come over the other side of the fence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we going after them?&rdquo;
I asked.</p>
<p>Razi glanced at Yassen.
&ldquo;No.
<em>La</em>, no, truly.
You are injured,
and we would most likely be walking into an ambush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another feeling?&rdquo; Yassen grunted.
He had clamped his left hand around the wound in his right arm
to slow the bleeding.</p>
<p>It was Razi&rsquo;s turn to spit.
&ldquo;I would rather not be a fool twice in one day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>People <em>dromed</em> that something had gone wrong
as soon as we got back to the hostel.
Yassen&rsquo;s brother Kirash washed his wound with liquor and then bound it.
Razi sat in a corner and glared at his tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t have known,&rdquo; I said,
seating myself across from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>La</em>, I should have.&rdquo;
He sighed.
&ldquo;I am getting old, Eimin.
Old and stupid and slow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that mean I can have your sword?&rdquo; I asked.
He just snorted.</p>

<h2>Chapter Turning Point</h2>
<p>Suresh came to find me the next morning.
I should have been practicing,
but instead I was back in the lemon grove, sketching.
I thought about leaving when he came over the hill—I didn&rsquo;t feel like talking to anyone,
especially him—then was immediately angry at myself.
I was done getting out of other people&rsquo;s way.
Let them stay out of mine for a change.</p>
<p>He trudged up the long rise to the foot of the lemon grove,
stopped to wipe his brow with his sleeve,
and waved at me.
I raised one hand carelessly in reply.
The sun had just cleared the big hill beside the palace.
It gave the lemon trees long shadows,
as if someone had smeared their hand across the page.
My sketch didn&rsquo;t look anything like that.
I snapped the book shut and leaned back against my tree.</p>
<p>It stood a little apart from the others.
I sometimes thought that someone must have spat out a seed
and happened to hit good soil.
It wasn&rsquo;t as tall or as straight as the ones in the grove,
and its lemons were so thick-skinned and sour
that even Grappa Uzman wouldn&rsquo;t eat them.
But it had a good view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair morning,&rdquo; Suresh said.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes but didn&rsquo;t reply.</p>
<p>He cleared his throat uncomfortably.
&ldquo;Listen, about last night.
I didn&rsquo;t realize you and Hediyeh were…&rdquo;
His voice trailed off.</p>
<p>I snorted.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not.&rdquo;
And then, because I&rsquo;d grown up among people who could <em>drome</em>,
and there&rsquo;s no point not asking a question when everyone around you knows you want to ask it,
I said, &ldquo;Did you…?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated, then nodded.
&ldquo;I kissed her, if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re asking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was.
I shrugged.
&ldquo;<em>La</em>, good for you.&rdquo;
I tossed a pebble down the hillside.</p>
<p>Suresh sat down a few feet away from me.
&ldquo;So what is it?
Why are you so mad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I scowled.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not my listener.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raised his hands, palms facing me, meaning,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard what you said,&rdquo;
then lowered them again.</p>
<p>We sat in silence for a few moments, looking at the trees.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just…&rdquo;
I shook my head. I could feel tears waiting to happen—tears, at sixteen.
I opened my eyes wide to dry them and tried to finish my sentence.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that you&rsquo;re not Aphsi,
so being <em>nif</em> doesn&rsquo;t matter.
But for me…&rdquo;
I spread my hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;
He nodded.
&ldquo;So when Hediyeh—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about Hediyeh!&rdquo;
I interrupted angrily.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s—it&rsquo;s just everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We sat in silence for a minute or more.
A light breeze off the glass rustled the leaves over my head.
Suresh cleared his throat.
&ldquo;Is that yours?&rdquo;
He nodded at the sword leaning against the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.
I&rsquo;m supposed to be practicing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood up and brushed his hands on his shirt.
&ldquo;May I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shrugged.
&ldquo;If you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took the scabbard in one hand,
hefting it for weight,
then drew the blade.
It wasn&rsquo;t much—two fingers wide at the base,
narrowing slowly to a point,
and sharp on both edges.
The grip was wrapped with plain goat leather,
with seed-sized grains of sand underneath to give it texture.
The hilt was a simple crosspiece,
slightly shorter on one side than the other.</p>
<p>Suresh swung it back and forth,
testing the balance,
then dropped his left foot back and folded his left arm behind his back.
&ldquo;Not bad.&rdquo;
He lunged at the air, stepped, lunged again, cut high,
parried his invisible opponent,
then straightened up.
&ldquo;How long have you had it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I got to my feet so that I wouldn&rsquo;t have to look up his nose
while talking to him.
&ldquo;About a year.
I haven&rsquo;t really used it much—I&rsquo;m a lot better with the bow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo;
He glanced at me.
&ldquo;But a bow&rsquo;s just a hunter&rsquo;s weapon, isn&rsquo;t it?
And they want to see if you can be more than just a hunter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I leaned against the lemon tree.
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sheathed the sword and handed the scabbard back to me.
&ldquo;I know about the Other Hand, Eimin.&rdquo;
His eyes searched my face.
&ldquo;I know who they are,
and what they&rsquo;re doing to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked down at the scabbard in my hands to hide my confusion.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rdquo;
On impulse,
I drew the sword and fell into the stance Razi had taught me,
turned sideways like Suresh had been,
but with my left hand up and out for balance or to grab at my opponent.</p>
<p>He pointed.
&ldquo;I mean like that.
That&rsquo;s not for dueling.
And no soldier would ever stand like that,
not with another man at each shoulder.
That&rsquo;s a brawler&rsquo;s stance.
That&rsquo;s for bandits and nightwork.
Eimin, do you know who Razi really is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I cut left, cut right, stabbed, stepped back, cut right, stabbed, stepped back, cut left.
Never the same pattern twice,
Razi had told me,
over and over again.
Watch for your opponents&rsquo; patterns,
but never give them any.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eimin!&rdquo;
Suresh stepped in front of me
and knocked my blade sideways with a sweep of his forearm.
&ldquo;Do you know who Razi really is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to talk to you about this,&rdquo; I said.
I felt—I don&rsquo;t know the words for what I felt.
Angry? Panicked?
Like I was standing on the edge of a cliff, looking down, with the wind tugging at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eimin, he works for Lady Kembe, in Ossiswe.
The magician.
He&rsquo;s her hands in the world.
Do you know that phrase?
He does the things she can&rsquo;t do herself.
He spies on people for her, and steals from them, and—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s any of that got to do with you?&rdquo;
I turned away from him and started another exercise,
a fast one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eimin, stop.
Stop! Listen to me.
It isn&rsquo;t my business, not that part,
but it is yours.
Or it ought to be.
How do you think she pays him back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magic.&rdquo;
I feinted and lunged, over and over,
trying to make it one smooth motion,
growing angrier by the second.
&ldquo;In case you hadn&rsquo;t noticed, there aren&rsquo;t any Aphsi magicians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but do you know what kind of magic?
Eimin, she makes <em>nif</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took a moment for his words to sink in.
I turned to him, the sword still in my hand.
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raised his hands, palms facing me.
&ldquo;She makes people <em>nif</em>, Eimin.
People like you.
That&rsquo;s the deal.
That&rsquo;s always been the deal.
The Other Hand does her work in the world, and she—&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rage boiled up inside me.
&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo;
I stepped toward him, raising the sword.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t flinch.
He didn&rsquo;t even look at the blade.
He just shook his head.
&ldquo;Think about it.
The Aphsi need to have <em>nif</em>.
They need people who can butcher and hunt and, and kill, like Razi sometimes kills.
Maybe there are a few natural <em>nif</em>,
but most of you are made that way before you&rsquo;re born.
That&rsquo;s what the Aphsi get from magicians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lying,&rdquo; I said coldly.
I sheathed the sword and stooped to pick up my sketchbook.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eimin—Eimin, I used to work for a magician, in Ossisswe.&rdquo;
His voice was almost pleading.
&ldquo;I was mending some old books for him,
and he asked me if I would take everything from his storeroom and put it on the shelves.
I dropped one of the boxes,
and while I was picking up the papers that had fallen out,
I saw some notes he&rsquo;d written down about a spell to make people <em>drome</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hah!&rdquo; I glared at him.
&ldquo;Now I know you&rsquo;re lying.
Magic can&rsquo;t make people <em>drome</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded.
&ldquo;I know.
He hadn&rsquo;t been able to make the spell work.
The point is,
what he&rsquo;d started with was an opposite spell,
to make people <em>nif</em>.
His notes said he&rsquo;d learned it from Lady Kembe,
who used it regularly.
That&rsquo;s what the page said, Eimin.
&lsquo;Regularly&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you came running out here to tell us, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated, then shook he head.
&ldquo;No.
That was three years ago.
I just put the pages back in the box and put the box on the shelf.
I didn&rsquo;t think it was any of my business.
I don&rsquo;t even think I&rsquo;d met any Aphsi back then.
But…&rdquo;
He shook his head.
&ldquo;I just couldn&rsquo;t let go of it.
Or it couldn&rsquo;t let go of me.
I started asking questions, and reading.
About a year ago I met a caravaneer who told me about the Other Hand,
about what happened to bandits who tried to raid the Aphsi.
And then I went to Razi&rsquo;s trial, and—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? What trial?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He searched my face again.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know that either?
Someone stole a glass turtle from Lord Mezeri.
He&rsquo;s another magician in Ossisswe,
Lady Kembe&rsquo;s main rival.
The city guard took Razi for it,
but couldn&rsquo;t prove it was him.
That&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s been here so much for the last year—Ossisswe wouldn&rsquo;t be healthy right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you.&rdquo;
I pushed past him.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe any of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eimin. Eimin!&rdquo; he called to my back.
&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you believe it or not.
You&rsquo;re not an accident, Eimin.
None of this is an accident.
They made you <em>nif</em>,
and now they&rsquo;re making you into a sword.&rdquo;
He fell silent.
I didn&rsquo;t look back.</p>

<h2>Chapter Hike</h2>
<p>I hiked out to Tin Point the next day.
I kept my pack light:
three canteens, my tent, some dry date bread, my knife, and my climbing rope.
I don&rsquo;t know why I took the climbing rope.
Or the knife, for that matter,
but I took my sketchbook and charcoals as well.</p>
<p>I skirted the pasture so that I wouldn&rsquo;t have to explain where I was going to Grappa Uzman.
It&rsquo;s funny—when I was little,
I loved to pet and feed his goats,
and listen to his stories about chasing away gargoyles,
or the time he went half-way to Ossisswe to sell one that had blue eyes.
Now that I&rsquo;m older,
I&rsquo;d love to hear those stories again.
At sixteen,
though,
I thought the stories were as boring as the grownups who told them.
Besides,
he would probably ask me where I was going, and since he wasn&rsquo;t <em>nif</em>,
I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to lie.</p>
<p>The path ran along the hill overlooking the palace,
then down past the gargoyles&rsquo; watchtower to the old shoreline.
The Sea of Glass was dazzling.
I put on my sun goggles as I walked.
The secret to traveling long distances,
I&rsquo;d discovered,
was to create a rhythm in my head.
My feet were its backbone:
left, right, left, right.
I imagined a little wordless tune on top of it,
da-dum-di-dum-di-diddle, da-dum-di-dum-di-day.
If I had my hands hooked through the shoulder straps of my pack,
I tapped another little pattern with my fingers:
first-fourth-second-third-thumb,
then fourth-second-third-first-thumb.
I could go a hundred paces or more with a single pattern.
When I grew tired of that,
I tried to see how many different words I could spell
using just the letters from words like &ldquo;eucalyptus&rdquo; or &ldquo;catastrophe&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And I had conversations, lots of them.
Sometimes they were things I didn&rsquo;t think of saying at the right time
that would have been funny, or cutting, or made me seem wise.
Other times I imagined myself rescuing someone from lions,
or climbing down a sheer cliff to save a child who&rsquo;d slipped and fallen.
I fought duels with bandits in the middle of gritstorms,
beat off whole flocks of gargoyles,
and snuck in and out of magicians&rsquo; palaces without leaving so much as my breath behind.</p>
<p><em>La</em>,
you&rsquo;re laughing,
but we&rsquo;ve all had daydreams like that.
I just wouldn&rsquo;t have told anybody about them when I was sixteen,
any more than I would have stopped to talk to Grappa Uzman.</p>
<p>I stopped for a drink and a mouthful of date bread when I reached the shore.
On a whim,
I dropped my pack and walked out fifty paces.
The three fish Razi had once showed me were still there,
frozen in the glass a double arm&rsquo;s length below me.
The one in front was bent slightly,
as if it had been about to turn when its world changed.
I&rsquo;d never noticed before,
but a shallow depression had been worn into the glass above the fish.
People had been coming to this spot for a thousand years.
They were long gone,
but the fish were still there.
I felt a little foolish after a moment,
so I walked back to the beach and kept going.</p>
<p>I stayed on the trail after that.
It would have been easier to walk on the glass—it was flatter,
and there weren&rsquo;t any potholes—but I was going to spend the next two days doing that.
I pulled a stubby leaf off a raspberry cactus as I walked
and chewed it to a pulp to kill my thirst.</p>
<p>There is life all around in the desert if you know where to look.
There was a spider web on that cactus, for example.
The spider might have been hiding from the sun down among the cactus&rsquo;s roots,
but she was there.
I saw finger lizards sunning themselves on rocks,
and an S-curve across the road that some snake had left the night before.
A shirrup followed me for half an hour or more,
flitting from rock to bush to cactus,
hoping for a crumb of date bread,
or maybe just waiting to see
if I would scare something tastier than finger lizards into breaking cover.</p>
<p>I slept beneath an overhanging rock during the middle of the day.
I allowed myself two mouthfuls of water before I closed my eyes—you
sweat less when you&rsquo;re not moving,
so my body would have a chance to soak it all up.
I kept my knife in my hand as I dozed,
as Razi had taught me.
I&rsquo;d been worried the first few times that I would cut myself in my sleep,
but I never had.
I still didn&rsquo;t do it when I was at home in my own hammock, though.</p>
<p>I reached the cache at the end of Tin Point an hour before sundown.
It was marked by a pile of rocks that came up to my waist.
There were water bottles underneath them,
and sealed jars of honeyed fruit, medicines, and bandages.
I didn&rsquo;t take anything—they were for emergencies—but it was a good place to camp.</p>
<p>I washed down a thick slice of date bread with what was left in my first canteen
and pulled my sketchbook out of my bag.
The sun had just touched the horizon,
turning the Sea of Glass red and orange.
I drew the lines of the frozen waves as quickly as I could,
smudging them with my thumb to make shadows.
The sea had been calm here when the great spell came.
I thought it must have been a beautiful day.</p>
<p>I stopped sketching when the creeping shadows reached me,
yawning and rolling my shoulders to get out the kinks.
After tucking my sketchbook in my pack,
I wrapped myself in my traveling robe for warmth.
Finally,
as the small creatures of the evening began to stir,
I couldn&rsquo;t avoid thinking about what Suresh had said any longer.</p>
<p>There were a hundred reasons why it couldn&rsquo;t be true.
Something like that could never be kept secret.</p>
<p>But maybe it wasn&rsquo;t a secret.
Maybe grownups just didn&rsquo;t talk about it around children.
Maybe they were waiting until they could <em>drome</em> that I was ready to accept it.
Maybe that was another of the Other Hand&rsquo;s tests.</p>
<p>I realized suddenly that I was playing finger-patterns on the ground,
one-four-three-two-thumb,
thumb-four-one-three-two.
I took a deep breath and relaxed.
What if—just supposing it was true.
Did my mother know?
Had someone come to her and my father and said,
&ldquo;It has been decided&rdquo;?
Or was there some sort of lottery?
Or had they volunteered?
I thought about my mother,
heavy and round like Hediyeh&rsquo;s mother had been when she was carrying the twins.
A dark figure bowed its head and put its hand on her belly.
The air tingled with power, and—</p>
<p>I shook my head.
It couldn&rsquo;t be true.
Being <em>nif</em> was just bad luck,
that was all.
And anyway,
if I&rsquo;d been made <em>nif</em>,
then Jephel must have been made that way too.
I snorted.
He was about as suitable for the Other Hand as a sack of lemons.</p>
<p>I woke up as the sky started to pale.
It only took me a moment to make water and shoulder my pack.
Dawn is the best time to walk on glass.
The glare is bad,
but you miss the worst of the heat,
so I put on my goggles and set off.</p>
<p>Once I was on it,
the surface didn&rsquo;t seem as calm as it had the evening before.
The frozen waves were a couple of feet high,
which meant my ankles always felt like they wanted to roll over.
Every few paces,
I had to step up onto the crest of the next wave.
My thighs started to burn after a few hundred steps,
but the feeling passed and I found my rhythm,
step step step and up, over and over again.</p>
<p>I waited until the sun was halfway to noon before putting up my umbrella.
I was quite proud of it—it was made out of Bantangui bamboo,
and I was always careful to roll the cloth rather than letting it fold,
so it wasn&rsquo;t cracked or creased.
Best of all,
the handle slipped into a sock I&rsquo;d sewn onto the side of my pack,
so that I had my hands free while I walked.</p>
<p>Nothing lives on the glass.
Even the birds don&rsquo;t go very far from shore.
Underneath is a different story:
there are places where springs well up,
and just enough light gets through the glass for life to bloom.
Grappa Uzman told me once that there were places where the glass had cracked,
and trees had sprouted,
but he never said where,
and from the smiles on other children&rsquo;s faces,
I guessed they could <em>drome</em> it was just a story.</p>
<p>I hiked until early in the afternoon,
then pitched my tent with the silver side out to reflect away the sun.
Lying inside was like being in an oven,
but walking would have been worse.
I drank some water and tried to take shallow breaths.
I had been turning Suresh&rsquo;s words over in my head while I walked.
What if?
What if it was true?
What if that was why my father had left?</p>
<p>I closed my eyes and did something I hadn&rsquo;t done since I was little.
I tried to <em>drome</em>.
For a while I believed that if only I wanted it enough,
if I really tried,
somehow I&rsquo;d be able to.
Then I laughed at myself.
The nearest living things were half a day&rsquo;s walk behind me.
Even if I could suddenly <em>drome</em>, how would I tell?</p>
<p>I crawled out of my tent late in the afternoon.
If I walked until midnight,
slept for three or four hours,
then pushed myself hard,
I&rsquo;d be at the fishing fleet by mid-day.
I wished that I had saved some of the raspberry cactus:
I was going to have enough water,
but I was thirsty whenever I let myself think about it.
So I tried to think about other things,
which meant about Suresh kissing Hediyeh,
and Jephel dancing with Mureya,
and how long it would be before someone found me if I slipped and broke my ankle on the glass.</p>
<p>The sun went down,
the stars came out,
and my thoughts chased themselves around in my head.
It could be true, I decided.
That didn&rsquo;t mean it was, but it could be.
Only a few Aphsi would have to know.
My mother probably didn&rsquo;t.
Even Razi might not.
The Other Hand could just decide and have their magician cast the spell without telling anyone,
then wait to see who worked out and who didn&rsquo;t.
Somebody like Jephel would just grow up to be a butcher.
Someone like me would be taught how to climb,
how to move silently,
how to become so still inside that even the most sensitive Aphsi in the world couldn&rsquo;t—</p>
<p>That was it.
All of the exercises Razi had given me,
teaching me to quiet my thoughts and let go of my feelings.
They weren&rsquo;t really to teach me how to hide my <em>deroma</em> from Aphsi.
What would be the point of that?
They were trying to see if I could control my anger enough
to be told that being <em>nif</em> wasn&rsquo;t just bad luck.</p>
<p>I stopped in my tracks.
I had never felt anything like the cold, clear rage that filled me at that moment.
I wanted to hurt somebody.
I wanted to drag them out into the village square
and tell the whole world what they&rsquo;d done.
I wanted to blind them,
put out their ears, make them <em>nif</em> like me,
and then leave them lying there, weeping.
I didn&rsquo;t know who &ldquo;they&rdquo; were, but I was going to find out.</p>
<p>I almost turned around to head straight back to Medef,
but instead I stayed on my original course.
&ldquo;A fatal mistake can sometimes save you a few minutes of thought,&rdquo; Razi told me once.
If I went back to Medef right away,
everyone in the village would be able to <em>drome</em> how angry I was.
I needed a plan,
and I needed to be as clear inside as the glass beneath my feet.</p>
<p>I reached the fishing fleet at dawn.
There was nothing left of them above the glassline,
not after a thousand years,
but their hulls still lay perfectly preserved.
Some of the fishermen had been thrown from deck onto the glass when the spell came
and froze the sea beneath them.
One had been up to his ankles in water:
I found the two holes that showed where his friends had chipped him out of the glass.
Their edges had been worn smooth by time,
but I could still see where each toe had been.</p>
<p>I looked around for a while to see if I could find any fish bones for good luck,
but they were long gone.
It felt eerie being there on my own,
looking at the moment when everything changed.
I knelt and ran my hand over a frozen bow wave,
then brushed my fingers along the worn top of the ship&rsquo;s hull.
There was grit there,
carried by the wind.
One day it would wear the waves themselves away.
I slipped my pack from my shoulders and pitched my tent.</p>
<p>Somehow I slept through the heat.
When I woke,
I tore a page out of my sketchbook,
wrote, &ldquo;Eimin the Nif was here&rdquo; on it,
and left it on the glass underneath an empty canteen.
My shadow walked tall beside me until the sun went down.</p>

<h2>Chapter N-1</h2>
<p>I ran.
I ran like a jackrabbit runs, like a hawk flies.
I ran like I had never run before with cold sick fear churning in my gut.
The moon was already half-way up the sky.
<em>I&rsquo;m not going to make it</em>,
I thought,
and ran even faster.</p>
<p>I stumbled just before the top of the hill,
scraping my hands and knees as I fell.
I knelt there panting for a moment,
then struggled back to my feet and kept going.
The only sounds were my breathing and the steady crunch of my sandals.
Razi&rsquo;s sword bumped against my hip every second step.</p>
<p>I reached the top of the hill.
The palace gleamed in the moonlight below.
I could smell lemon trees and moist earth.
There!
Someone was standing in the shadows by the palace gate.
No,
there were two people,
and they were kissing.
It was Suresh and Hediyeh.</p>
<p>She pushed him away,
then grabbed his wrists and pulled him back.
They kissed again.
<em>Good,</em> I thought coldly.
<em>As long as they&rsquo;re doing that, I don&rsquo;t have to worry about being seen.</em></p>
<p>The path dipped behind a shoulder of the hill.
When I could see the palace again
the gate was open and they were gone.
Then I was running through rows of eucalyptus, neat and square.</p>
<p>The trees stopped two dozen strides from the gate.
I slowed to a walk,
drawing Razi&rsquo;s sword.
The quicksilver blade took shape with a soft gurgle,
like water being poured from a jug.
Heart pounding,
I stepped through the gate.</p>
<p>The palace music played softly around me.
I let out my breath with a whoosh.
It would have stopped if the spell had already been broken.
There was still time.
I closed my eyes.
My heart was pounding in my chest.
I imagined calming it,
soothing it,
as if it were a frightened pocket mouse.
Suresh couldn&rsquo;t <em>drome</em>—at least,
I hoped he couldn&rsquo;t—but Hediyeh certainly could.
<em>Sh, be still, be still,</em> I thought.
I imagined myself petting my heart gently,
rubbing its ears,
brushing its soft fur.
I imagined it growing still under my hand until it did.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes.
My moonshadow was just two fingers wide.
There wasn&rsquo;t much time left.
I trotted across the outer courtyard on the balls of my feet
and took the stairs two at a time.
I was calm.
I was certain.
I was as clear as breath,
a quiet stream flowing without a ripple or a wave.</p>
<p>I pressed myself against the wall next to the open door,
then craned my head to look into the greeting room.
Empty.
I slipped inside.
They had probably gone through the inner courtyard to the pool.
I ran the other way, to the audience room.
A side door opened onto a narrow stairway
that led up to a window set just below the roof.
When the palace was in use,
a servant would have stood there to watch for guests arriving.
It didn&rsquo;t overlook the pool,
but it was big enough for me to squeeze through.</p>
<p>I pushed Razi&rsquo;s sword back into its bottle,
corking it with the handle,
then put both hands on the sill and hopped onto it.
It wasn&rsquo;t quite tall enough for me to stand,
so I leaned out,
one hand on the wall for balance,
the other reaching up for the edge of the roof.
The stone was cool against my skin.
I took a breath, let go of the wall, and stepped out.</p>
<p>My whole weight hung from one hand for a heartbeat
until my other hand found purchase.
I pulled myself up onto the roof and drew Razi&rsquo;s sword once again.
The stones were dark and discolored
where the brief puddles left behind by occasional storms had dried.
I hunched down and crept forward.</p>
<p>Suresh and Hediyeh were already in the pool,
laughing and splashing.
Their clothes lay at the pool&rsquo;s edge.
Suresh&rsquo;s body and legs were pale in the moonlight,
though his hands and feet and face were bark brown.
Hediyeh—Hediyeh was all one color.
That&rsquo;s all I want to say.</p>
<p>Suresh lunged forward, catching Hediyeh&rsquo;s foot.
&ldquo;Stop it! Stop it!&rdquo; she squealed as he tickled her.
He dove,
swam beneath her,
popped up behind her,
and flicked water off his fingers into her eyes as she turned around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she giggled, wiping her face.
&ldquo;You swim so well.
You&rsquo;re like a fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.
I practically grew up in the water back home.&rdquo;
He slipped around her, heading for his clothes.
&ldquo;Used to spend pretty much every summer in the lake, looking for treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Treasure? Really?&rdquo; Hediyeh dog-paddled after him.
I shifted my weight.
What was he doing?</p>
<p>He glanced up at the moon, then back at Hediyeh.
&ldquo;I was, I don&rsquo;t know, seven, maybe eight,
and there was this story about a boy who found a gold necklace and a helmet once.
It was a true story, too.&rdquo;
He reached out and pulled his clothes closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not getting out already, are you?&rdquo; Hediyeh pouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? No, no, I&rsquo;m just…
Anyway, the boy sold them in Ossisswe,
then bought a whole herd of goats and lived happily ever after.&rdquo;
Suresh pulled something out of the pocket of his trousers
and turned back to Hediyeh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did you ever find anything?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm hm.&rdquo;
He held up the ring.
It sparkled in the moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Let me see!&rdquo;
He held it out, then pulled it away just before she took it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and get it,&rdquo; he grinned.
He wriggled away,
drawing her toward him,
always out of reach.
He was leading her closer to the waterstone beneath me.
I tensed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, stop teasing!&rdquo;
Hediyeh paddled forward.
I slipped my feet out of my sandals.
Suresh was almost close enough.
Almost…</p>
<p>Suddenly he stopped backing away.
He looked up at the sky.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time,&rdquo; he said,
and slipped the ring onto his finger.</p>
<p>Hediyeh screamed in shock as she <em>dromed</em> the ancient haunt flooding into Suresh.
He lunged forward and grabbed her arm.
&ldquo;Let go! Let go!&rdquo; she shrieked.
She tried to pull away, but he was too strong.
He pulled her close,
spinning her around so that he could get his other arm around her neck.
The ring throbbed with red light,
making the water look like blood had already been spilled in it.</p>
<p>I splashed into the pool an arm&rsquo;s length away,
a shock running up my spine as my feet hit the bottom.
Hediyeh screamed again.
I raised my arm.
Razi&rsquo;s quicksilver blade licked the night above us.
&ldquo;Let go of her!&rdquo; I ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eimin!&rdquo;
Suresh tightened his grip on Hediyeh&rsquo;s neck,
choking off her scream.
&ldquo;What are you—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go!&rdquo;
I twisted in the water and feinted at him.
The sword blade snapped like a whip just inches from his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eimin, wait, listen to me.
Listen!
You have to let me do this.
Eimin, it&rsquo;s for both of us.&rdquo;
He glanced up at the moon again.
&ldquo;Please, Eimin, think!
Think about what they did to you.
Think about what they kept from you!
Once I have the power that&rsquo;s in that stone,
I can undo that.
I can make you like everyone else.
We can stop them from ever doing it to anyone ever again.
Please,
Eimin,
I know what you&rsquo;re thinking,
but it&rsquo;s the only way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m thinking,&rdquo; I said.
I flicked the sword at him again to try to back him away from the stone.
He didn&rsquo;t flinch this time.
The blade caught his shoulder,
leaving a thin red line that immediately started to drip.
The ring brightened hungrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that it?
Are you going to be a pawn all your life, when you could be a king?&rdquo;
Hediyeh pulled at his arm.
Her mouth was open,
her eyes bulged.
She couldn&rsquo;t breathe.
He was choking her while he talked to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m going to be,&rdquo; I told him,
flicking the sword again.
&ldquo;All I know is that you&rsquo;re a liar.
Nobody did this to me.
Nobody made me this way.
My mother wouldn&rsquo;t let them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face hardened.
He took a deep breath.
He was going to dive.
Hediyeh had almost stopped struggling.
He was going to dive and give her death to the stone.
I was out of time.</p>
<p>I lunged forward.
Razi&rsquo;s sword went right through the joint of Hediyeh&rsquo;s shoulder
and into Suresh&rsquo;s ribs.
She couldn&rsquo;t scream,
but he could,
a scream was rage and pain
and a thousand years of being trapped in a little shard of glass.</p>
<p>He shouted a word and slapped the sword blade with the hand that wore the ring.
The blade snapped like a dry twig.
He rolled in the water and dove.
I dropped the broken sword and went after him.</p>
<p>His ring was so bright now that it cast red-tinged shadows.
Hediyeh was limp in his arms.
Dark blood made the water murky.
He grabbed the corner of the waterstone with one hand to steady himself
and held her down against it with the other.
Air bubbled out of his mouth as he began the spell.</p>
<p>I frog-kicked over to him and grabbed his arm.
He tried to beat me away,
but the water took the force of the blow away.
I was already running out of air.
The ring was blinding me.
I let go of him,
grabbed Hediyeh&rsquo;s arm,
and planted my feet on the waterstone to try to pull her away.</p>
<p>Cold…
I had never felt cold like that.
It was as if ice water was flooding into my veins.
The waterstone <em>wanted</em>.
Its hunger rose through my legs into my body.
I pulled weakly at Hediyeh&rsquo;s arm.
It was too late.
The cold was in my heart, sucking all my strength away.
I couldn&rsquo;t—</p>
<p>With the last of my strength I twisted
and jammed my fingers into Suresh&rsquo;s mouth to stop the spell.
He bit them in surprise, then tried to pull his head away.
He couldn&rsquo;t let go of the waterstone.
He couldn&rsquo;t let go of Hediyeh.
He couldn&rsquo;t get away from me,
so he tried to spit them out,
but I hung on.
I was actually holding on to his bottom teeth for an instant.</p>
<p>The red glow started to fade.
He shook his head from side to side frantically.
I was so cold.
I couldn&rsquo;t feel my legs any more.
The glow flickered and died.
In the last of its light I caught a glimpse of Suresh&rsquo;s face.
Whatever was in there looked back at me full of hate and despair and longing,
and then it was gone.</p>
<p>The next thing I remember I was lying on my back looking up at the stars.
I didn&rsquo;t know where I was.
I was cold,
but I didn&rsquo;t have the energy to fetch a blanket.
My mother would look in on me in a while.
She could always <em>drome</em> when I was awake,
when I was too hot or too cold.
She&rsquo;d take care of me.</p>
<p>I blinked and turned my head as Suresh dragged Hediyeh out of the pool.
I must have made a sound, because he looked at me.
Our eyes met.
He shook his head slowly and started to sob.
I closed my eyes again.</p>
<p>When I woke again, Razi was beside me.
He had cut his shirt into strips to bandage Hediyeh&rsquo;s shoulder.
Suresh was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cold…&rdquo; I whispered.
He nodded without looking at me,
intent on his work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>La</em>, I will build a fire as soon as I can.
She has lost a lot of blood.&rdquo;
He knotted another strip of shirt under her armpit,
then sat back and rubbed his ankle.
&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suresh…?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Razi shook his head.
&ldquo;Gone. But he left this.&rdquo;
He held up the ring.
It was just glass now.
Whatever had been in it had missed its chance.</p>
<p>I tried to sit up, but I was too weak.
It was like one of those bad dreams where you&rsquo;re a puppet whose strings have been cut,
so that you can see and hear but can&rsquo;t move.
For some reason it seemed funny to me.
I started to chuckle,
but it turned into a wheeze.</p>
<p>Razi turned the ring over in his hand,
then tucked it into his pocket and struggled to his feet.
&ldquo;Now,
where&rsquo;s my sword? If there&rsquo;s even a scratch on it…&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the end I went for help so that Razi could stay and look after Hediyeh.
It wasn&rsquo;t a good idea.
I only had to walk as far as the goat pasture,
but it seemed to take as long as my trek out to the fleet.
I stumbled lightheadedly straight into the arms of Grappa Uzman.
I don&rsquo;t know how much sense he made of the story I told him,
but it frightened him enough for him to send one of his grandsons to Medef for help.
I fell asleep, shivering, as the sun came up.</p>

<section>
<h2>Epilog</h2>
<p>It was a month before my strength returned.
I spent most of that time sleeping,
or sitting on the roof watching the world go by.
A pair of sand pigeons built a nest in the eucalyptus tree beside our house.
Little Ashwara took her first steps.
And somehow, Hediyeh became a hero.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still not sure how that happened.
The waterstone had taken even more out of her than me,
and for a few days the wound in her shoulder—the wound I&rsquo;d given her—looked
like it was going to go bad.
Once she was well enough to sit up and talk,
though,
her room was never empty.
Everyone wanted to hear the story from her,
grownups and children alike.
Or maybe they could just <em>drome</em> how much she enjoyed telling her version of it.</p>
<p>Razi came to see me regularly.
One morning he brought three people with him, two men and a woman.
The two men asked me questions,
drawing every little detail of the story out of me.
The woman just listened and frowned.</p>
<p>Razi came back into my room after they left
and turned his hand over, palm up, palm down, meaning, &ldquo;The Other Hand&rdquo;.
I nodded.
I had guessed as much.
They didn&rsquo;t look like Razi,
any more than any other Aphsi,
but there was something in their eyes,
sadness and patience and acceptance and watchfulness all at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They still haven&rsquo;t found Suresh,&rdquo; he told me.
&ldquo;Someone took water and food from the cache at Tin Point,
but there&rsquo;s no trail.
Lady Kembe tried a spell, but even she couldn&rsquo;t find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he&rsquo;s dead?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>Razi shook his head.
&ldquo;Dead men can&rsquo;t hide that well.
Oh, but here, I almost forgot.
This is for you.&rdquo;
He brought his arm out from behind his back
and handed me a chessboard in a leather sleeve
and a cloth bag full of pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
I slipped the board out of its sleeve.
&ldquo;Do you have time for a game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grinned.
&ldquo;<em>La</em>, always.&rdquo;
He pulled the little lopsided table I&rsquo;d made over beside my hammock,
sat on the stool on the other side,
and poured the pieces onto the board.
A moment later he held up two fists.
&ldquo;Choose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I laughed.
&ldquo;Either.&rdquo;
He laughed too,
then opened his hands to show me a pair of white pawns.</p>
