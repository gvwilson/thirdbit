<h1>Eimin</h1>



<section>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>People believe many different things about what happens when you die.
In the north, the Ruudians spent six hundred years fighting undead monsters who stripped the flesh from the bones of the living.
Sunshine and courage were often their only weapons,
so I suppose it is not surprising that they believe the souls of the righteous dead rise up to fuel the sun
so that it can shine down and keep us safe forever.</p>
<p>In the west,
on the other hand,
the farmers of the Regimental Kingdoms bury their dead to thank the earth for its bounty.
Just as flesh becomes soil, then barley, then flesh again,
so too,
they believe,
does the world fashion new spirits out of old.</p>
<p>The pirates of Ini Bantang and Barra Bantang believe in rebirth too,
except they believe we are reborn as ourselves to live our lives over again until we get them right.
This is why they say <em>im awa pha ta</em> whenever anything bad happens:
it means, &ldquo;Oh no, not this again.&rdquo;
And I met a tiger once who told me that when we die we&rsquo;re dead,
and that all the rest is just monkey foolishness.
Later,
though,
he asked me to ring a bell in memory of a friend of his,
so perhaps tigers can be foolish too.</p>
<p>But in the Karaband,
where I was born,
people believe that when they die they get to tell the story of their life one last time.
It doesn&rsquo;t matter then if it&rsquo;s filled with great deeds and poetry or simple and quiet.
All that matters is whether the person telling the story enjoys hearing it again.</p>
<p>We Karabandi think it&rsquo;s important to know what our stories are going to be like while we are still living them,
so every once in a while we go to someone and say,
&ldquo;This is the tale of me.&rdquo;
Sometimes it is best if the listener is a once-met stranger.
Other times the story will only make sense if the listener is someone in particular—a loved one who has been wronged
or someone who remembers the sour-sweet taste of a particular grandmother&rsquo;s date cookies.</p>
<p>And sometimes,
when the story that needs telling is particularly difficult,
people seek out someone who is so good at listening that they have become famous for it.
You can find such listeners in every town or caravan.
We all have some other profession—cobbler, bookster, even thief—but our real calling is to hear people out.
We try not to judge, and we never repeat any of what we&rsquo;re told.
We just help people find out what their lives mean while they are still living them.</p>
<p>The other thing we listeners do is teach people how to tell their stories.
It can be hard if you&rsquo;ve never done it before—our lives teach us to hide our feelings,
even from ourselves,
and digging them up can be harder than mining glass.
I find the easiest way is to tell people my own story first,
so if there is any tea left in the pot…?
And perhaps a little more of the honey?
Thank you.</p>
<p>So: my name is Eimin, and this is the tale of me.
I was born in Medef, on the eastern shore of the Sea of Glass.
The people of Medef are not like people elsewhere.
They are Aphsi:
they can <em>drome</em> whether someone are happy or sad,
just as you can smell what is cooking before you go into the kitchen.
Aphsi mothers can tell that babies are hungry or tired before they start to cry.
Aphsi traders always know whether the person they are bargaining with is honest.
And Aphsi thieves are the best in the world:
they can <em>drome</em> when a street vendor is sleepy,
or whether a guard is paying more attention to the women washing their hair in the courtyard in front of him
than to the sound of footsteps on the roof over his head.</p>
<p>But not me.
I can&rsquo;t <em>drome</em>.
I am <em>nif</em>, like you.
I kicked and kicked when I was inside my mother because I couldn&rsquo;t <em>drome</em> her trying to soothe me.
Later,
when I was a baby,
I cried whenever my mother or father left the room
because I couldn&rsquo;t <em>drome</em> that they were just around the corner.</p>
<p>No one knows why the Aphsi are what they are.
Some people think we have always been that way.
Others blame it on the great spells of the Pilots&rsquo; last war,
and others—well, I will speak of that in time.</p>
<p>Let me first tell you what it was like to grow up <em>nif</em> among children who could <em>drome</em>.
They—the other children my age in Medef—used to play a game with me called &ldquo;surprise&rdquo;.
Sometimes,
when I was watching an anthill or practicing my letters,
they would sneak up behind me and shout, &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;
I would jump, and they would all laugh.
They couldn&rsquo;t imagine what it was like to not know that someone was behind them.
(Did I mention that Aphsi make good guards as well as good thieves?)</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t always mind being surprised:
at least it meant the other children were paying attention to me.
Mostly, though, it just made me angry.
I would tell them to stop, or run to my mother and get her to tell them.
They would, but only long enough for me to go back to my ants or my letters
so that they could sneak up behind me again.</p>
<p>I still have a scar—here, on the ball of my thumb—from the time Hediyeh and her friends surprised me
while I was carving a new pawn for Razi&rsquo;s chess set.
I was ten,
and the cut went right down to the bone.
Hediyeh had to go without food for a day as punishment,
and her parents gave my mother a spool of fine green thread to apologize,
but as far as Hediyeh and her friends were concerned that just made it my fault.</p>
<p>In a way, though, that cut is where my story begins.
That cut, and the talk I had with Razi that evening.
He came to our house just as my mother put the last stitch into my thumb.
The two of them sat for a while in the shade garden while I moped around under the awning out back,
picking at my new stitches and feeling sorry for myself.</p>
<p>When they were done talking,
Razi came to fetch me for a game of chess.
&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Let me have a look at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; I told him sullenly.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.
&ldquo;Show me,&rdquo; he insisted,
taking his embroidered chessboard out of its sleeve
and unrolling it on the ground between us.
I shrugged and held out my hand.
He inspected the four black stitches, then nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They used to do that to me too. Here, look.&rdquo;
He pulled up his right sleeve.
A beaded scar ran from his elbow to his wrist like a worm track on his skin.
&ldquo;I got so tired of them sneaking up on me that I climbed a date tree to get away from them.
I sat up there for, <em>la</em>, it must have been hours, just watching people come and go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed.
&ldquo;It was so peaceful that I fell asleep!
And <em>hup</em>, down I fell and broke my arm.
They had to give me poppy juice and cut it open to straighten out the bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d break my arm myself if it would stop Hediyeh and the others from playing stupid tricks on me,&rdquo; I grumbled.
I picked up a black pawn, put my hands behind my back, then held my fists out to him.</p>
<p>Razi didn&rsquo;t tap one.
Instead, he snapped his fingers against bad luck.
&ldquo;You should be careful what you ask for,&rdquo; he warned me.
&ldquo;<em>La</em>, and even more careful what you offer in return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew that tone of voice, and the look in his eyes.
All of a sudden I was even angrier than I had been when I cut my thumb.
What right did he have to pity me?
He was as <em>nif</em> as I was!
&ldquo;Are you going to choose or not?&rdquo; I asked, waving my fists above the board.</p>
<p>He reached out as if to choose a hand, then grabbed my wrists.
&ldquo;Open up,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ow!&rdquo; I opened my hands.
The black pawn I had taken from the chessboard lay in one.
The one I had spent the day carving lay in the other.</p>
<p>Razi laughed.
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll take white,&rdquo; he said, letting go of my wrists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>He grinned and pointed at the chessboard.
&ldquo;You forgot to pick up a white one,&rdquo; he told me.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to try to trick someone, <em>la</em>, you must plan more than one move ahead.&rdquo;
He scratched the side of his nose.
&ldquo;For example, think about—what&rsquo;s her name? Hediyeh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not,&rdquo; I said sourly.
I had spent hours carving that pawn…</p>
<p>He shook his head.
&ldquo;Just because you can&rsquo;t <em>drome</em>, it doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re deaf and blind.
Look at pocket mice.
They can&rsquo;t <em>drome</em> either, but have you ever tried to sneak up on one?
They&rsquo;re always listening, always sniffing the air.
If you listen that hard, and learn to pay attention, no-one will ever be able to sneak up on you.
And if you learn to be as still inside as a piece of glass,
then one day maybe you will be able to sneak up on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <em>how</em>?&rdquo; I was so frustrated that my voice broke.</p>
<p>Razi shrugged his shoulders and twisted his right hand around.
Just like that he had a short, sharp knife in his hand.
The blade was blackened, but sunlight glinted on its edge.
&ldquo;I can teach you, if you want,&rdquo;
he said quietly.</p>
<p>I stared at the knife like a pocket mouse staring at a snake.
Razi was more than just a wandering <em>nif</em> tinker,
and he was offering me far more than I had realized I was bargaining for.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p>Five years later Razi sat cross-legged in front of his tent in the lemon grove,
weighing feathers in the tin pans of a little balance.
&ldquo;Have you eaten?&rdquo; he asked without looking up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.
And I brought date bread for lunch.
<em>Umma</em> made it yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded.
&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;
He took a sand-brown feather from the balance and trimmed it with his knife.
&ldquo;Canteens are in the tent.
We&rsquo;ll need one each, and a spare.&rdquo;
The balance leveled.
Razi set the feather aside, then removed another from the bag beside him.</p>
<p>By the time I had filled the canteens and returned,
he had trimmed a dozen feathers to exactly the same weight.
He laid them flat in a folded square of paper so that they wouldn&rsquo;t be crushed.
&ldquo;Finish those later,&rdquo; he said, standing and stretching.
He stooped and pulled his bow case from his tent.
It was a long tube of hard brown leather as tall as I was.
A second tube, shorter and fatter, was his quiver.
Any feather on any arrow in that quiver would level the balance with any other.</p>
<p>The last thing he took was a dark green bottle wrapped in woven leather plaits.
Its stopper was a sword hilt with a plain leather grip.
Razi hung it on his left hip and grinned at me.
&ldquo;All set?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded.
My bow was slung over my shoulder in the padded cloth case my mother had made for it.
I had fifteen arrows, each with a barbed steel head, and a machete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Razi.
He clapped me on the shoulder.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go hunting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Razi led us south, skirting the ruins of the Pilots&rsquo; palace before turning inland toward the watchtower.
We played chess as we walked, each telling the other a move every fifty paces.
It&rsquo;s harder than it sounds:
not only do you have to keep the position in your head,
you have to think of a plan while you&rsquo;re counting paces.
It was fun,
but it was also another of Razi&rsquo;s exercises,
training me to keep track of time and distance while I was worrying about other things.</p>
<p>Time and distance are what the desert is about.
How far am I travelling?
When will I run out of water?
After Razi said, &ldquo;Checkmate,&rdquo; time and distance filled my thoughts.
How much longer would I stay in Medef?
How far could I go when I left?
The furthest I&rsquo;d ever been was Uef.
It was a tenth the size of Medef, just thirty families living around a spring three days away.
I wanted to see Ossisswe, and Ruuda, and Ini Bantang, and, oh, the whole world.
I wanted to see what a city looked like, a city full of <em>nif</em> like me.
I wanted to have adventures
so that I could come back to Medef to tell stories
and have girls like Hediyeh blush and giggle when I walked by,
the way they blushed and giggled when <em>nif</em> traders passed through.</p>
<p>I put one foot in front of the other, taking four steps for every three of Razi&rsquo;s.
The sun was half-way to noon when Razi turned east.
We circled around the watchtower hill so that we could come at it from the side closest to the Sea of Glass.
I tried to figure out his plan while we walked.
We would reach the tower mid-afternoon.
That didn&rsquo;t make sense: at that time of day, the breeze would carry our scent straight to the gargoyles.
Unless…</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>La</em>, am I to be bait?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>Razi shook his head.
&ldquo;No, I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We reached the beach an hour later.
It was an eerie place.
A thousand years of dry wind had scoured most of the sand away,
leaving a glass shelf that rippled with the shape of ancient waves.
Pieces had cracked and broken over the years,
littering the rock below with sharp-edged shards that could cut even the sturdiest sole.</p>
<p>Razi pointed.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a path down there by three rocks that look like a mother goat and two kids.
Do you know it?&rdquo;
I nodded.
&ldquo;Work your way up behind them.
I&rsquo;ll come at them from below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded again.
&ldquo;How will I know when you&rsquo;re ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grinned.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took me half an hour to get in position.
I moved from rock to bush,
never taking more than a dozen steps at once,
scanning the sky for slow-circling wings before picking my way to the next bit of cover.
I tried to keep my mind clear, to think only about the next few steps.
I was just a pocket mouse—no,
not even that,
just a wind-blown scrap of tumbleweed.</p>
<p>I was about five hundred paces from the watchtower when the first gargoyle launched herself into the air.
She didn&rsquo;t start flying right away.
Instead,
she plummeted earthward down the side of the tower for a moment to build up speed,
then snapped her wings open with a <em>crack</em>
and began spiralling back into the sky on an updraft.</p>
<p>I crouched behind the eroded remains of an old wall and slipped my bow out of its case.
I had waxed its string that morning when I was unable to sleep.
There, in the moment, I cursed the faint smell of honey that still lingered.
I slipped one loop into the catch at the bottom end of the bow,
braced it against my foot,
then bent it and hooked the other end of the string in place in a single motion
the way Razi had taught me.</p>
<p>I swallowed a mouthful of water and set my canteen down in the wall&rsquo;s narrow shadow.
I still had some date bread,
but I couldn&rsquo;t have eaten it then for its weight in pewter.
Instead I pulled the drawstrings at my wrists and ankles tight
so that my sleeves and pantlegs wouldn&rsquo;t catch on anything.</p>
<p>The second female launched herself from the tower.
As she rose to follow the first one
I slipped around the end of the ruined wall
and sprinted to the candelilla bush I&rsquo;d chosen as my next patch of cover.
I had hunted jackrabbits and sand gulls this way,
watching for the moments when my prey looked away,
inching closer a few paces each time.</p>
<p>Suddenly one of the gargoyles stooped, yipping at the other.
My breath caught.
It must be Razi.
I slipped two arrows from my quiver, put one between my teeth, and raised my head.</p>
<p>The third gargoyle, the male, took wing just as I looked up.
His wingspan was twice that of the females,
and his voice boomed instead of shrieking when he answered their call.
He flapped its wings to gain height.
The two females circled him as he climbed, all three calling to each other.</p>
<p>Razi broke cover and ran straight for the tower,
holding his bow in both hands like a spear for balance.
One of the females screeched and plummeted at him, arms outstretched.
Razi threw himself sideways at the last moment,
rolled over,
and came up on one knee to fire an arrow I hadn&rsquo;t even seen him draw.
It punched through the taut skin of the gargoyle&rsquo;s wing.</p>
<p>The other female swooped in behind her,
herding Razi toward the waiting male who would make the kill.
I sighted,
leading her,
time and distance made reflex by long hours of practice.</p>
<p>Razi ran again toward the tower again.
The second female cut across his path to cut him off.
He checked himself so that she overshot,
but the male was right behind her.
Razi jabbed at him with his bow.
The male stumbled in the air as it hit his wing,
one taloned foot raking Razi&rsquo;s scalp.</p>
<p>I fired my first arrow as the male started to climb.
It passed harmlessly behind him.
I pulled another from my quiver.
I could taste the one between my teeth,
my snapshot arrow.</p>
<p>There was blood on Razi&rsquo;s face.
He had two arrows out himself, one in his teeth, one strung.
As the first female dove a second time, he fired, drew, fired again.
The second shot hit her shoulder, cutting some vital muscle or tendon.
She tumbled sideways as her wing crumpled.</p>
<p>The male bellowed five stories above Razi&rsquo;s head.
I drew, exhaled, and let fly.
My arrow hit him square in the chest.
The impact knocked him sideways in the air.
My snapshot arrow struck his leg a moment later,
but I think he was already dead.
He turned over once as he fell.</p>
<p>The second female shrieked and banked away.
I saw Razi aim, then lower his bow.
She was too far away and moving too fast.</p>
<p>I ran to him as he wiped blood from his face with his sleeve.
&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>He glared at his sleeve as if blaming it for being stained.
&ldquo;No. Where&rsquo;s the spare canteen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have it,&rdquo; I said, pointing.
He turned his glare on me.
Then his look softened and he chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>La</em>, so I do.&rdquo;
He handed me his bow, unstoppered the canteen, and splashed some water onto his face.
&ldquo;Gaaah… I&rsquo;m a mess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something rustled behind me.
I whirled around.
The female that Razi had shot had struggled to her feet.
Her right wing hung uselessly at her side.
She chittered,
clutching feebly at the arrow that had passed through the complicated double joint
where arm and wing joined body.</p>
<p>Razi wiped some more blood from his face.
&ldquo;Here, give me that.&rdquo;
He took his bow back from me and drew an arrow.
The female just stood there on her short, bandy legs and watched with all-too-human eyes
as Razi sighted carefully and put an arrow through her heart.</p>

<section>
<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p>We walked back to the lemon grove in somber silence,
leaving the gargoyles&rsquo; bodies where they were to feed the desert.
They had been taking Grappa Uzman&rsquo;s goats.
He had suggested building a fire in the base of the tower to drive them away,
but Razi had said no,
they would just come back when the smoke was gone.
And anyway,
how would we fuel the fire?
Nothing near the tower would burn—did <em>sri</em> Uzman really want
to spend a week carrying loads of dried camel dung?</p>
<p>If someone else had asked that,
Grappa Uzman would have puffed up his chest and said yes,
he would do it.
Then one of his daughters would put her hand on his arm and gentled him
the way he gentled his goats when storms came.
But somehow,
coming from Razi,
the words made the idea seem so silly that they both laughed.
I was trying to figure out how Razi did that,
but it was proving harder to learn than the bow.</p>
<p>The sun was down by the time we reached the hill above the palace.
The moon hung low over the Sea of Glass,
a mottled diamond whose light turned the frozen waves into irregular bands of light and shadow.
Beneath us, the Pilots&rsquo; ancient stronghold glistened
as if it had been painted with teardrops.
Music still rose faintly from its walls
a thousand years and more after its builders had destroyed themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; Razi said, pointing.
At first I didn&rsquo;t see anything,
but then motion caught my eye.
A sandy desert hare stood on his haunches,
sniffing the wind,
while its tribe snuffled and nibbled among the eucalyptus trees that grew next to the palace walls.
I saw a splash in the aqueduct behind them as a fish jumped for a night fly.
The hares froze,
ready to scatter,
then returned to their search for dinner,
the moment already forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want help?&rdquo; I asked,
gesturing at the bandage wrapped around Razi&rsquo;s head.
He nodded, and we started down the hill.</p>
<p>The aqueduct ran from the center of the palace all the way to the village.
It was rough-edged sandstone,
human work,
and seemed half-finished compared to the smooth curved sparkle of the palace.
A square pool bulged out of the aqueduct&rsquo;s side every hundred strides or so.
I filled our canteens at the first of these
as Razi unwrapped his bandage and handed it to me.
Splashing some water on its end, I dabbed at the gash the gargoyle had given him,
jumping only slightly when another little fish went <em>ploop</em> beside us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>La</em>, that will do,&rdquo; Razi eventually said.
He fingered the gash&rsquo;s edges gingerly.
&ldquo;How does it look?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like someone tried to open up your head.&rdquo;
I rolled up the bandage—we would boil it clean later—and yawned.</p>
<p>Razi grinned. &ldquo;It is past your bedtime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded.
It had been a long day.
We picked up our gear and trudged up to Razi&rsquo;s tent in the lemon grove.
Their blossoms gave the air a sharp,
clean edge.</p>
<p>A clay pot held closed with twine sat in wait.
Undoing the knot, Razi lifted the lid and sniffed.
&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo;
Goat stew with chilis and pomegranates—one of Grappa Uzman&rsquo;s many daughters or granddaughters
must have brought it as payment for the day&rsquo;s work.
Razi held it out to me.</p>
<p>I shook my head.
&ldquo;<em>Umma</em> will be waiting.&rdquo;
My mother always stayed up when I was out with Razi.
I knew because our neighbors complained that her worrying kept them awake.</p>
<p>Razi set the pot down and raised his palms to me.
&ldquo;You did well today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not well enough.&rdquo;
The whole way home,
I&rsquo;d been thinking about missing my first shot.</p>
<p>He clapped me on the shoulder.
&ldquo;Yes, well enough.
Now <em>la</em>, get some sleep.
We&rsquo;ll talk tomorrow.&rdquo;
He pushed me gently toward home.</p>
<p>I read once that the name &ldquo;Aphsi&rdquo; comes from
an old Thindi phrase <em>aph e sessi</em>, meaning, &ldquo;the quiet people&rdquo;.
If you were to walk through Medef after dark,
you would understand why.
Most of the conversations people surround themselves with
don&rsquo;t really convey any information.
Their purpose is reassurance:
you are safe, your friends are here.</p>
<p>Aphsi don&rsquo;t need that.
They can <em>drome</em> whether all is well or not.
There was a drum in the village square to sound the alarm
in case of bandits or fire,
but most of the villagers would never think to use it.
The only sounds that night as I walked home were the goats,
the birds,
and Jephel playing the flute.</p>
<p>He and Mureya were sitting on an old palm log people used as a bench.
He broke off when he caught sight of me and waved.
I waved back,
not breaking stride,
but then he asked,
&ldquo;How did it go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sighed under my breath.
&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;
He shuffled sideways to make room for me,
not noticing the uncomfortable look on Mureya&rsquo;s face.
She could <em>drome</em> that I didn&rsquo;t want to stop and talk—not with Jephel, anyway..</p>
<p>But Jephel was <em>nif</em> like me, and he wanted to know the details.
There had been three?
And we&rsquo;d killed them all?
Oh, but Razi was hurt?
He spoke so slowly that I couldn&rsquo;t help but interrupt every third sentence.
He didn&rsquo;t seem to mind,
but Jephel never seemed to mind anything:
not his chores,
or the teasing of the other children,
or the names they had called him when his parents apprenticed him to the village butcher.
The only time I&rsquo;d ever seen him angry was
when Hediyeh and some of the other girls teased Mureya for holding his hand.
I don&rsquo;t know what they <em>dromed</em>,
but they never did it again.</p>
<p>I finally ran out of patience.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s been a long day, and <em>umma</em> will be wondering where I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, of course.&rdquo;
He ducked his head.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure everyone will be pleased that you took care of it.&rdquo;
He laughed.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like I could have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;
I raised a hand and hurried away.
Behind me,
he started playing again,
a slow love song that the girls always asked for.</p>
<p>My mother was waiting for me at the door with a soft smile on her face.
&ldquo;We got them,&rdquo; I said unnecessarily.
She nodded and held up my festival <em>deel</em>
to show me that she had finished sewing new cuffs on the sleeves,
then set it aside to give me a quick hug.</p>
<p>I dropped my gear and sat on a pillow on the floor,
reaching up to take the bowl of rice and peppers she handed me.
Ten minutes later I was asleep on the slat bed
in the curtained alcove that had been mine since I turned ten.
My mother had put fresh sprigs of mint and lemon under my pillow.
I think I dreamed of desert hares, and of moonlight on the Sea of Glass,
but after so many years it is hard to remember.</p>
<p>My mother shook me awake.
&ldquo;Razi wants you.&rdquo;
Her voice was soft and urgent.
&ldquo;Now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was an hour before dawn.
I dipped my fingers in the washbowl and ran them through my hair,
slipped my <em>deel</em> over my head,
and hurried out the door with my sandals still in my hand.
A moment later I doubled back to grab my bow
and the pack I had carried the day before.</p>
<p>A dayglass lantern cast dull orange light over two dozen people
in the village square.
I didn&rsquo;t need to be able to <em>drome</em> to know they were worried.
Razi had taken the bandage off his head.
The gash was already scabbed over,
and not for the first time,
I wondered about how quickly he healed.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed at a bald man in the center of the crowd
I had never seen before.
&ldquo;He says he is from a caravan heading to Ossisswe.
They were attacked by bandits,
and lost half of their livestock and most of their water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Razi gave a quick, angry jerk of his head.
&ldquo;<em>La</em>, that is my thought also.
They need help to round up what&rsquo;s left of their animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which would empty out the village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Razi nodded again.
&ldquo;<em>La</em>, just so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grappa Uzman broke off talking to the stranger and beckoned us over.
Jephel was there,
and Yassen the butcher,
and Yassen&rsquo;s twin brother Kirash who did whatever chores people would give him
and drank too much—all the village <em>nif</em>.
&ldquo;Here is Dudir uy-Armaq,&rdquo; Grappa Uzman said,
introducing the stranger to us in the formal way:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Razibendra uy-Ossisswe,&rdquo; Razi replied, raising his palms.
Up close,
the stranger was younger than I had thought—no more than eighteen.
His head was shaved,
not bald,
and his bare arms were as thick as my thighs.</p>
<p>Dudir raised his palms in return,
then grasped Razi&rsquo;s hand in the city way.
&ldquo;My father told me to look for you.
He said you could help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>La</em>, if I can.&rdquo;
Razi turned to Grappa Uzman and raised his voice so everyone could hear.
&ldquo;With your leave, grappa, I will take Kirash and half a dozen to find their animals.
Everyone else should stay here and keep watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half a dozen?&rdquo; Dudir&rsquo;s dismay made him sound angry.
&ldquo;We lost two hundred goats last night!
We&rsquo;ll never find them all with just half a dozen people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Razi grinned. &ldquo;Half a dozen <em>Aphsi</em>,&rdquo; he corrected.</p>
<p>Two minutes later they were on their way out of the village
and Yassen, Jephel, and I were on the roof of the bakery.
Yassen had fetched his bow—like me, he had been taught to use it when he was young.
Jephel had been taught too,
but had never amounted to more than a danger to himself.
There was nothing wrong with his eyes,
though,
or with his patience.
If the lion and her bandits came within a hundred strides of any villager, they would know.
Our job was to spot them if they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yassen nudged me with his elbow and passed me a stoppered jug of lemon water.
I took a sip and passed it to Jephel,
my eyes on the hills south and east of the village.
The sun was just coming up,
casting long autumn shadows tinged green-blue at the edges.
If anything moved, we would—</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; Yassen said flatly, pointing.
I looked north.
Nothing, nothing…I saw it,
a dark outline that changed shape as it moved.
I counted three, four, and then a fifth,
larger,
on four legs instead of two.
It was the lion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pass me a rag,&rdquo; Yassen ordered.
Silently,
Jephel handed him a scrap of cotton cloth.
As Yassen wound it around the head of an arrow,
Jephel uncorked the brown bottle Yassen had &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; from his brother.
The sharp smell that came from it was the evil twin of the lemon water&rsquo;s tang.</p>
<p>Yassen splashed some of the alcohol on the rag, then cursed.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t bring any matches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had some, wrapped in waxed paper in my <em>deel</em>,
along with a sewing needle and a toothpick.
A scratch and a touch later,
the rag on the arrow was alight.</p>
<p>Yassen set it carefully on the string, drew, and let fly.
The flame fluttered and died before the arrow arced down
to strike an innocent patch of candelilla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they saw it?&rdquo; Jephel asked.</p>
<p>The morning shadows were already shorter than they had been,
but knowing where to look,
I saw the bandits slipping away into the desert.
&ldquo;She saw it,&rdquo; I said.
Lions only attack when they have the element of surprise.
We would stay on the roof and watch
in case she and her humans were desperate enough to try without that,
but the excitement was over.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<p>The caravan straggled into Medef an hour later,
trailing an ochre plume of dust.
From the bakery roof,
I counted ten carts and thirty people:
eleven on camels,
six in carts,
and the rest on foot.
A short string of pack camels trailed behind the last cart
in brightly-colored harnesses.
As I watched,
the knots holding a round-cornered box on one camel&rsquo;s back came loose.
It tumbled to the ground and broke open,
spilling dark cloth bags holding buttons or spices onto the trail.
A woman in a red and gray <em>deel</em> rushed over
and beat the camel&rsquo;s flank with her palms to get it to stop,
cursing when it didn&rsquo;t even break stride.</p>
<p>One cart stood out from the rest.
It was drawn by a pair of burros
instead of one of the humpless camels the other carters used,
and its spoked wheels would have come up to my armpits.
Whatever occupied it was securely wrapped in dark blue canvas
held in place with enough rope to rig a tents.
Its driver sat with his back against his cargo
and the burros&rsquo; reins loose in his hand.
He wore darkly-patterned <em>deel</em> and a bright yellow turban,
which meant either that he was from Ossisswe,
or that he was a scholar,
or that he liked the color yellow.</p>
<p>I nudged Yassen with my elbow.
He sat up and scratched his beard with both hands.
Jephel glanced at him,
then at me,
then went back to watching the hills where we had seen the lion and her thieves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry looking bunch, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; Yassen said sourly.
He was right:
when Razi had said &ldquo;caravan&rdquo;,
I had expected fifty carts or more.
Medef saw two that size each year,
one for the examination festival in Ossisswe,
the other three months later
when merchants from the Salt Coast who were willing to risk the deep desert
came through on their way to Coriandel.
They brought dayglass, chocolate, silk, mace, coral, fine leather, and books.
Looking at the tired faces below me,
I wondered if anyone in this &ldquo;caravan&rdquo; could even read.</p>
<p>Yassen stood and stretched.
The sun was a handspan past noon,
and the heat made the bakery roof feel like the ovens beneath us.
&ldquo;I need to fiss,&rdquo; he grumbled,
lifting the palmed roof-hatch 
and clambering down the ladder into the cool dark below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we get some water?&rdquo; Jephel asked.
He held up his canteen and shook it to show it was empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send some up.&rdquo;
The closing hatch muffled his words.</p>
<p>Jephel sighed.
&ldquo;No he won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said philosophically,
long accustomed to people forgetting about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here.&rdquo;
I tossed my canteen at him.
Being thirsty would be better than listening to him not complain.</p>
<p>As the caravan approached,
a handful of villagers busied themselves in the posting yard.
Palm tree logs stood in a rough grid, twelve strides to a side.
Ropes were quickly strung on the pulleys hanging from their tops.
Squares of canvas,
each big enough to cover the roof I was sitting on,
were laid across the ropes and hauled into place
to form a single great awning over the fairground.
The southern and eastern sides were blocked by more canvas
to keep out the hot afternoon wind.</p>
<p>A hundred strides away,
four men strained to raise the sluice gate at the end of the aqueduct.
Anywhere else in the Karaband,
they would have chanted, &ldquo;<em>Heph…ho!</em>&rdquo; to stay in time.
But they were Aphsi,
so they worked in silence.</p>
<p>The sluice gate finally gave in with a screech of stone on stone.
Water poured from the aqueduct into the pipe that led to the fairground,
where it splashed into a short trough that in turn spilled into a longer one.
People would wash their hands and food in the first,
while animals would drink from the second.</p>
<p>Two sharp whistles cut through the bustle.
I shielded my eyes with my hand
as Razi and the villagers who had gone with him
came over the horizon in the midst of a hundred or more goats.
There wouldn&rsquo;t be any stragglers:
if a goat was alive,
an Aphsi would have <em>dromed</em> it and brought it in.</p>
<p>The caravan&rsquo;s lead cart reached the stone gate that marked the edge of Medef.
Dudir sat on the front bench beside an older man with the same brawny arms,
eagle-beak nose,
and shaven head
who I took to be his father.
Grappa Uzman and Granna Efiyeh raised their palms to the pair in welcome.</p>
<p>A few strides further on,
Hediyeh and some of the other girls stood in a cluster,
their hands tucked politely in their sleeves
and their faces shadowed by the hoods of their <em>deels</em>.
I watched Hediyeh&rsquo;s head turn to follow the cart as it passed her.
As Dudir turned to look back,
something prickled up my spine.
I didn&rsquo;t have to be able to <em>drome</em> to recognize
the calculating look in Hediyeh&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>Before I could think any more about it
the cart with the strange cargo caught my eye again.
Karabandi are proud of the fact that no two <em>deels</em> are exactly alike.
We lengthen them, shorten them, add pockets in common or unlikely places,
or reinforce the shoulders if we frequently carry heavy loads.
Over time,
every <em>deel</em> learns from its wearer how to do its job better,
and every Karabandi learns how to read a person&rsquo;s life from their <em>deel</em>.</p>
<p>The driver in the yellow turban
wore a <em>deel</em> like none I had ever seen.
The pattern on it was actually black and blue stains.
A wide belt was sewn around the waist to support the weight of
whatever jingled and clanked in the double pockets on each side.
There were more small pockets on the sleeves,
though these seemed empty.
A long tear in the side had been carefully stitched shut.
I knew Razi would ask me later what his trade was,
but I had no idea.</p>
<p>He chose a spot in the furthest corner of the tented market.
Whatever was in his cart was obviously heavy:
he had tied it securely right over the axle
to stop its weight from tipping the cart.
As he scratched his burros&rsquo; ears
and fed them handfuls of barley
he noticed me studying him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>La</em>, young sir,&rdquo; he said,
tying the feed bag shut and tossing it onto the cart seat,
&ldquo;Will you help a traveler?&rdquo;
He spoke in a pleasant tenor,
rolling his R&rsquo;s and slanting his Th&rsquo;s like an Ossisswean.
When I nodded,
he raised his voice.
&ldquo;Dudir? A moment, if you would?&rdquo;
The brawny young man I took to the be the lead carter&rsquo;s son ambled over.</p>
<p>The man in the yellow turban turned back to me.
&ldquo;Here is Suresh ul-Ossisswe,&rdquo; he said, raising his palms.</p>
<p>I raised mine.
&ldquo;Here is Eimin ul-Medef,&rdquo; I replied.
He raised an eyebrow—at my age,
I should have introduced myself as someone and someone&rsquo;s—but made no comment.
Instead,
he reached into the cart and began passing me cloth-wrapped packages
to stack on the shelves behind me.</p>
<p>I knew their wait instantly.
They were books, dozens of them.
My stomach suddenly rumbled.
&ldquo;Would you like me to unwrap them?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>Suresh shook his head.
&ldquo;<em>La</em>, thank you, but no.
I just want them out of the way so we can get the press off the cart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The press?&rdquo; I repeatedly stupidly.</p>
<p>He pointed at the irregular shape squatting in his cart.
&ldquo;My printing press.&rdquo;
The look on my face made him laugh good-naturedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re another one, are you?&rdquo;
Dudir said as he joined us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another what?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>He snorted.
&ldquo;Never mind.
Let&rsquo;s get this weeping thing on the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Getting it down meant chocking the wheels,
undoing several knots,
and then looping the ropes around the press again.
With Dudir&rsquo;s weight on one harness post,
and mine and Suresh&rsquo;s on the other,
we tilted the cart back and paid out the ropes
to get the press on solid ground.
The whole process took about half an hour,
by which time the sun was down
and the smell of barbecued goat had turned my stomach into a hard knot of hunger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phah!&rdquo;
Dudir stretched until something in his back popped.
&ldquo;Glad that&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;
He undid the broad belt of his <em>deel</em> and slipped it over his head
to reveal a sleeveless shift and long, loose pants.</p>
<p>I heard giggles behind me.
Hediyeh and the other girls were supposed to be helping make the welcome dinner,
but they had taken advantage of the bustle
to slip away for an early look at what the caravaneers had brought.
With so many <em>nif</em> about,
it would be a while before their parents noticed they were gone.</p>
<p>Dudir grinned at them as he shook out his <em>deel</em> and put it back on.
He was as muscular as an ox.
<em>And probably as smart,</em> I thought sourly.</p>
<p>Suresh clapped him on the shoulder.
&ldquo;Thank you again,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;And you as well,&rdquo; he continued to me.
He gestured at the bundles of books sitting patiently in the stall beside his cart.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d like to borrow anything for the night…?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I heard another giggle.
I&rsquo;m sure the girls could <em>drome</em> how much I wanted
to take them all back to my alcove and pore through them,
sounding out the words I did not know and wondering about the people who had written them.
&ldquo;Thank you, but it is late,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;Perhaps tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He inclined his head.
&ldquo;<em>La</em>, as you wish.&rdquo;
He clapped me on the shoulder and headed for the barbecue pit.
I hesitated a moment,
then turned for home.</p>

<h2>Chapter N-1</h2>
<p>I ran.
I ran like a jackrabbit runs, like a hawk flies.
I ran like I had never run before with cold sick fear churning in my gut.
The moon was already half-way up the sky.
<em>I&rsquo;m not going to make it</em>,
I thought,
and ran even faster.</p>
<p>I stumbled just before the top of the hill,
scraping my hands and knees as I fell.
I knelt there panting for a moment,
then struggled back to my feet and kept going.
The only sounds were my breathing and the steady crunch of my sandals.
Razi&rsquo;s sword bumped against my hip every second step.</p>
<p>I reached the top of the hill.
The palace gleamed in the moonlight below.
I could smell lemon trees and moist earth.
There!
Someone was standing in the shadows by the palace gate.
No,
there were two people,
and they were kissing.
It was Suresh and Hediyeh.</p>
<p>She pushed him away,
then grabbed his wrists and pulled him back.
They kissed again.
<em>Good,</em> I thought coldly.
<em>As long as they&rsquo;re doing that, I don&rsquo;t have to worry about being seen.</em></p>
<p>The path dipped behind a shoulder of the hill.
When I could see the palace again
the gate was open and they were gone.
Then I was running through rows of eucalyptus, neat and square.</p>
<p>The trees stopped two dozen strides from the gate.
I slowed to a walk,
drawing Razi&rsquo;s sword.
The quicksilver blade took shape with a soft gurgle,
like water being poured from a jug.
Heart pounding,
I stepped through the gate.</p>
<p>The palace music played softly around me.
I let out my breath with a whoosh.
It would have stopped if the spell had already been broken.
There was still time.
I closed my eyes.
My heart was pounding in my chest.
I imagined calming it,
soothing it,
as if it were a frightened pocket mouse.
Suresh couldn&rsquo;t <em>drome</em>—at least,
I hoped he couldn&rsquo;t—but Hediyeh certainly could.
<em>Sh, be still, be still,</em> I thought.
I imagined myself petting my heart gently,
rubbing its ears,
brushing its soft fur.
I imagined it growing still under my hand until it did.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes.
My moonshadow was just two fingers wide.
There wasn&rsquo;t much time left.
I trotted across the outer courtyard on the balls of my feet
and took the stairs two at a time.
I was calm.
I was certain.
I was as clear as breath,
a quiet stream flowing without a ripple or a wave.</p>
<p>I pressed myself against the wall next to the open door,
then craned my head to look into the greeting room.
Empty.
I slipped inside.
They had probably gone through the inner courtyard to the pool.
I ran the other way, to the audience room.
A side door opened onto a narrow stairway
that led up to a window set just below the roof.
When the palace was in use,
a servant would have stood there to watch for guests arriving.
It didn&rsquo;t overlook the pool,
but it was big enough for me to squeeze through.</p>
<p>I pushed Razi&rsquo;s sword back into its bottle,
corking it with the handle,
then put both hands on the sill and hopped onto it.
It wasn&rsquo;t quite tall enough for me to stand,
so I leaned out,
one hand on the wall for balance,
the other reaching up for the edge of the roof.
The stone was cool against my skin.
I took a breath, let go of the wall, and stepped out.</p>
<p>My whole weight hung from one hand for a heartbeat
until my other hand found purchase.
I pulled myself up onto the roof and drew Razi&rsquo;s sword once again.
The stones were dark and discolored
where the brief puddles left behind by occasional storms had dried.
I hunched down and crept forward.</p>
<p>Suresh and Hediyeh were already in the pool,
laughing and splashing.
Their clothes lay at the pool&rsquo;s edge.
Suresh&rsquo;s body and legs were pale in the moonlight,
though his hands and feet and face were bark brown.
Hediyeh—Hediyeh was all one color.
That&rsquo;s all I want to say.</p>
<p>Suresh lunged forward, catching Hediyeh&rsquo;s foot.
&ldquo;Stop it! Stop it!&rdquo; she squealed as he tickled her.
He dove,
swam beneath her,
popped up behind her,
and flicked water off his fingers into her eyes as she turned around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she giggled, wiping her face.
&ldquo;You swim so well.
You&rsquo;re like a fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.
I practically grew up in the water back home.&rdquo;
He slipped around her, heading for his clothes.
&ldquo;Used to spend pretty much every summer in the lake, looking for treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Treasure? Really?&rdquo; Hediyeh dog-paddled after him.
I shifted my weight.
What was he doing?</p>
<p>He glanced up at the moon, then back at Hediyeh.
&ldquo;I was, I don&rsquo;t know, seven, maybe eight,
and there was this story about a boy who found a gold necklace and a helmet once.
It was a true story, too.&rdquo;
He reached out and pulled his clothes closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not getting out already, are you?&rdquo; Hediyeh pouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? No, no, I&rsquo;m just…
Anyway, the boy sold them in Ossisswe,
then bought a whole herd of goats and lived happily ever after.&rdquo;
Suresh pulled something out of the pocket of his trousers
and turned back to Hediyeh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did you ever find anything?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm hm.&rdquo;
He held up the ring.
It sparkled in the moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Let me see!&rdquo;
He held it out, then pulled it away just before she took it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and get it,&rdquo; he grinned.
He wriggled away,
drawing her toward him,
always out of reach.
He was leading her closer to the waterstone beneath me.
I tensed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, stop teasing!&rdquo;
Hediyeh paddled forward.
I slipped my feet out of my sandals.
Suresh was almost close enough.
Almost…</p>
<p>Suddenly he stopped backing away.
He looked up at the sky.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time,&rdquo; he said,
and slipped the ring onto his finger.</p>
<p>Hediyeh screamed in shock as she <em>dromed</em> the ancient haunt flooding into Suresh.
He lunged forward and grabbed her arm.
&ldquo;Let go! Let go!&rdquo; she shrieked.
She tried to pull away, but he was too strong.
He pulled her close,
spinning her around so that he could get his other arm around her neck.
The ring throbbed with red light,
making the water look like blood had already been spilled in it.</p>
<p>I splashed into the pool an arm&rsquo;s length away,
a shock running up my spine as my feet hit the bottom.
Hediyeh screamed again.
I raised my arm.
Razi&rsquo;s quicksilver blade licked the night above us.
&ldquo;Let go of her!&rdquo; I ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eimin!&rdquo;
Suresh tightened his grip on Hediyeh&rsquo;s neck,
choking off her scream.
&ldquo;What are you—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go!&rdquo;
I twisted in the water and feinted at him.
The sword blade snapped like a whip just inches from his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eimin, wait, listen to me.
Listen!
You have to let me do this.
Eimin, it&rsquo;s for both of us.&rdquo;
He glanced up at the moon again.
&ldquo;Please, Eimin, think!
Think about what they did to you.
Think about what they kept from you!
Once I have the power that&rsquo;s in that stone,
I can undo that.
I can make you like everyone else.
We can stop them from ever doing it to anyone ever again.
Please,
Eimin,
I know what you&rsquo;re thinking,
but it&rsquo;s the only way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m thinking,&rdquo; I said.
I flicked the sword at him again to try to back him away from the stone.
He didn&rsquo;t flinch this time.
The blade caught his shoulder,
leaving a thin red line that immediately started to drip.
The ring brightened hungrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that it?
Are you going to be a pawn all your life, when you could be a king?&rdquo;
Hediyeh pulled at his arm.
Her mouth was open,
her eyes bulged.
She couldn&rsquo;t breathe.
He was choking her while he talked to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m going to be,&rdquo; I told him,
flicking the sword again.
&ldquo;All I know is that you&rsquo;re a liar.
Nobody did this to me.
Nobody made me this way.
My mother wouldn&rsquo;t let them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face hardened.
He took a deep breath.
He was going to dive.
Hediyeh had almost stopped struggling.
He was going to dive and give her death to the stone.
I was out of time.</p>
<p>I lunged forward.
Razi&rsquo;s sword went right through the joint of Hediyeh&rsquo;s shoulder
and into Suresh&rsquo;s ribs.
She couldn&rsquo;t scream,
but he could,
a scream was rage and pain
and a thousand years of being trapped in a little shard of glass.</p>
<p>He shouted a word and slapped the sword blade with the hand that wore the ring.
The blade snapped like a dry twig.
He rolled in the water and dove.
I dropped the broken sword and went after him.</p>
<p>His ring was so bright now that it cast red-tinged shadows.
Hediyeh was limp in his arms.
Dark blood made the water murky.
He grabbed the corner of the waterstone with one hand to steady himself
and held her down against it with the other.
Air bubbled out of his mouth as he began the spell.</p>
<p>I frog-kicked over to him and grabbed his arm.
He tried to beat me away,
but the water took the force of the blow away.
I was already running out of air.
The ring was blinding me.
I let go of him,
grabbed Hediyeh&rsquo;s arm,
and planted my feet on the waterstone to try to pull her away.</p>
<p>Cold…
I had never felt cold like that.
It was as if ice water was flooding into my veins.
The waterstone <em>wanted</em>.
Its hunger rose through my legs into my body.
I pulled weakly at Hediyeh&rsquo;s arm.
It was too late.
The cold was in my heart, sucking all my strength away.
I couldn&rsquo;t—</p>
<p>With the last of my strength I twisted
and jammed my fingers into Suresh&rsquo;s mouth to stop the spell.
He bit them in surprise, then tried to pull his head away.
He couldn&rsquo;t let go of the waterstone.
He couldn&rsquo;t let go of Hediyeh.
He couldn&rsquo;t get away from me,
so he tried to spit them out,
but I hung on.
I was actually holding on to his bottom teeth for an instant.</p>
<p>The red glow started to fade.
He shook his head from side to side frantically.
I was so cold.
I couldn&rsquo;t feel my legs any more.
The glow flickered and died.
In the last of its light I caught a glimpse of Suresh&rsquo;s face.
Whatever was in there looked back at me full of hate and despair and longing,
and then it was gone.</p>
<p>The next thing I remember I was lying on my back looking up at the stars.
I didn&rsquo;t know where I was.
I was cold,
but I didn&rsquo;t have the energy to fetch a blanket.
My mother would look in on me in a while.
She could always <em>drome</em> when I was awake,
when I was too hot or too cold.
She&rsquo;d take care of me.</p>
<p>I blinked and turned my head as Suresh dragged Hediyeh out of the pool.
I must have made a sound, because he looked at me.
Our eyes met.
He shook his head slowly and started to sob.
I closed my eyes again.</p>
<p>When I woke again, Razi was beside me.
He had cut his shirt into strips to bandage Hediyeh&rsquo;s shoulder.
Suresh was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cold…&rdquo; I whispered.
He nodded without looking at me,
intent on his work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>La</em>, I will build a fire as soon as I can.
She has lost a lot of blood.&rdquo;
He knotted another strip of shirt under her armpit,
then sat back and rubbed his ankle.
&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suresh…?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Razi shook his head.
&ldquo;Gone. But he left this.&rdquo;
He held up the ring.
It was just glass now.
Whatever had been in it had missed its chance.</p>
<p>I tried to sit up, but I was too weak.
It was like one of those bad dreams where you&rsquo;re a puppet whose strings have been cut,
so that you can see and hear but can&rsquo;t move.
For some reason it seemed funny to me.
I started to chuckle,
but it turned into a wheeze.</p>
<p>Razi turned the ring over in his hand,
then tucked it into his pocket and struggled to his feet.
&ldquo;Now,
where&rsquo;s my sword? If there&rsquo;s even a scratch on it…&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the end I went for help so that Razi could stay and look after Hediyeh.
It wasn&rsquo;t a good idea.
I only had to walk as far as the goat pasture,
but it seemed to take as long as my trek out to the fleet.
I stumbled lightheadedly straight into the arms of Grappa Uzman.
I don&rsquo;t know how much sense he made of the story I told him,
but it frightened him enough for him to send one of his grandsons to Medef for help.
I fell asleep, shivering, as the sun came up.</p>

<h2>Epilog</h2>
<p>It was a month before my strength returned.
I spent most of that time sleeping,
or sitting on the roof watching the world go by.
A pair of sand pigeons built a nest in the eucalyptus tree beside our house.
Little Ashwara took her first steps.
And somehow, Hediyeh became a hero.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still not sure how that happened.
The waterstone had taken even more out of her than me,
and for a few days the wound in her shoulder—the wound I&rsquo;d given her—looked
like it was going to go bad.
Once she was well enough to sit up and talk,
though,
her room was never empty.
Everyone wanted to hear the story from her,
grownups and children alike.
Or maybe they could just <em>drome</em> how much she enjoyed telling her version of it.</p>
<p>Razi came to see me regularly.
One morning he brought three people with him, two men and a woman.
The two men asked me questions,
drawing every little detail of the story out of me.
The woman just listened and frowned.</p>
<p>Razi came back into my room after they left
and turned his hand over, palm up, palm down, meaning, &ldquo;The Other Hand&rdquo;.
I nodded.
I had guessed as much.
They didn&rsquo;t look like Razi,
any more than any other Aphsi,
but there was something in their eyes,
sadness and patience and acceptance and watchfulness all at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They still haven&rsquo;t found Suresh,&rdquo; he told me.
&ldquo;Someone took water and food from the cache at Tin Point,
but there&rsquo;s no trail.
Lady Kembe tried a spell, but even she couldn&rsquo;t find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he&rsquo;s dead?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>Razi shook his head.
&ldquo;Dead men can&rsquo;t hide that well.
Oh, but here, I almost forgot.
This is for you.&rdquo;
He brought his arm out from behind his back
and handed me a chessboard in a leather sleeve
and a cloth bag full of pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
I slipped the board out of its sleeve.
&ldquo;Do you have time for a game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grinned.
&ldquo;<em>La</em>, always.&rdquo;
He pulled the little lopsided table I&rsquo;d made over beside my hammock,
sat on the stool on the other side,
and poured the pieces onto the board.
A moment later he held up two fists.
&ldquo;Choose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I laughed.
&ldquo;Either.&rdquo;
He laughed too,
then opened his hands to show me a pair of white pawns.</p>
