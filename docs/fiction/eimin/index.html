<h1>Eimin</h1>



<section>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>People believe many different things about what happens when you die.
In the north, the Ruudians spent six hundred years fighting undead monsters who stripped the flesh from the bones of the living.
Sunshine and courage were often their only weapons,
so I suppose it is not surprising that they believe the souls of the righteous dead rise up to fuel the sun
so that it can shine down and keep us safe forever.</p>
<p>In the west,
on the other hand,
the farmers of the Regimental Kingdoms bury their dead to thank the earth for its bounty.
Just as flesh becomes soil, then barley, then flesh again,
so too,
they believe,
does the world fashion new spirits out of old.</p>
<p>The pirates of Ini Bantang and Barra Bantang believe in rebirth too,
except they believe we are reborn as ourselves to live our lives over again until we get them right.
This is why they say <em>im awa pha ta</em> whenever anything bad happens:
it means, &ldquo;Oh no, not this again.&rdquo;
And I met a tiger once who told me that when we die we&rsquo;re dead,
and that all the rest is just monkey foolishness.
Later,
though,
he asked me to ring a bell in memory of a friend of his,
so perhaps tigers can be foolish too.</p>
<p>But in the Karaband,
where I was born,
people believe that when they die they get to tell the story of their life one last time.
It doesn&rsquo;t matter then if it&rsquo;s filled with great deeds and poetry or simple and quiet.
All that matters is whether the person telling the story enjoys hearing it again.</p>
<p>We Karabandi think it&rsquo;s important to know what our stories are going to be like while we are still living them,
so every once in a while we go to someone and say,
&ldquo;This is the tale of me.&rdquo;
Sometimes it is best if the listener is a once-met stranger.
Other times the story will only make sense if the listener is someone in particular—a loved one who has been wronged
or someone who remembers the sour-sweet taste of a particular grandmother&rsquo;s date cookies.</p>
<p>And sometimes,
when the story that needs telling is particularly difficult,
people seek out someone who is so good at listening that they have become famous for it.
You can find such listeners in every town or caravan.
We all have some other profession—cobbler, bookster, even thief—but our real calling is to hear people out.
We try not to judge, and we never repeat any of what we&rsquo;re told.
We just help people find out what their lives mean while they are still living them.</p>
<p>The other thing we listeners do is teach people how to tell their stories.
It can be hard if you&rsquo;ve never done it before—our lives teach us to hide our feelings,
even from ourselves,
and digging them up can be harder than mining glass.
I find the easiest way is to tell people my own story first,
so if there is any tea left in the pot…?
And perhaps a little more of the honey?
Thank you.</p>
<p>So: my name is Eimin, and this is the tale of me.
I was born in Medef, on the eastern shore of the Sea of Glass.
The people of Medef are not like people elsewhere.
They are Aphsi:
they can <em>drome</em> whether someone are happy or sad,
just as you can smell what is cooking before you go into the kitchen.
Aphsi mothers can tell that babies are hungry or tired before they start to cry.
Aphsi traders always know whether the person they are bargaining with is honest.
And Aphsi thieves are the best in the world:
they can <em>drome</em> when a street vendor is sleepy,
or whether a guard is paying more attention to the women washing their hair in the courtyard in front of him
than to the sound of footsteps on the roof over his head.</p>
<p>But not me.
I can&rsquo;t <em>drome</em>.
I am <em>nif</em>, like you.
I kicked and kicked when I was inside my mother because I couldn&rsquo;t <em>drome</em> her trying to soothe me.
Later,
when I was a baby,
I cried whenever my mother or father left the room
because I couldn&rsquo;t <em>drome</em> that they were just around the corner.
And when I was older—<em>la</em>, but I will speak of that in its time.</p>
<p>No one knows why the Aphsi are what they are.
Some people think we have always been that way.
Others blame it on the great spells of the Pilots&rsquo; last war,
and and others—well, I will speak of that in time too.</p>
<p>Let me first tell you what it was like to grow up <em>nif</em> among children who could <em>drome</em>.
They—the other children my age in Medef—used to play a game with me called &ldquo;surprise&rdquo;.
Sometimes,
when I was watching an anthill or practicing my letters,
they would sneak up behind me and shout, &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;
I would jump, and they would all laugh.
They couldn&rsquo;t imagine what it was like to not know that someone was behind them.
(Did I mention that Aphsi make good guards as well as good thieves?)</p>
<p>To tell the truth, I didn&rsquo;t always mind the game:
at least it meant the other children were paying attention to me.
Mostly, though, it just made me angry.
I would tell them to stop, or run to my mother and get her to tell them.
They would, but only long enough for me to go back to my ants or my letters
so that they could sneak up behind me again.</p>
<p>I still have a scar—here, on the ball of my thumb—from the time Hediyeh and her friends surprised me
while I was carving a new pawn for Razi&rsquo;s chess set.
I was ten,
and the cut went right down to the bone.
Hediyeh had to go without food for a day as punishment,
and her parents gave my mother a spool of fine green thread to apologize,
but as far as Hediyeh and her friends were concerned that just made it my fault.</p>
<p>In a way, though, that cut is where my story begins.
That cut, and the talk I had with Razi that evening.
He came to our house just as my mother put the last stitch into my thumb.
The two of them sat for a while in the shade garden while I moped around under the awning out back,
picking at my new stitches and feeling sorry for myself.</p>
<p>When they were done talking,
Razi came to fetch me for a game of chess.
&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Let me have a look at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; I told him sullenly.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.
&ldquo;Show me,&rdquo; he insisted,
taking his embroidered chessboard out of its sleeve
and unrolling it on the ground between us.
I shrugged and held out my hand.
He inspected the four black stitches, then nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They used to do that to me too. Here, look.&rdquo;
He pulled up his right sleeve.
A beaded scar ran from his elbow to his wrist like a worm track on his skin.
&ldquo;I got so tired of them sneaking up on me that I climbed a date tree to get away from them.
I sat up there for, <em>la</em>, it must have been hours, just watching people come and go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed.
&ldquo;It was so peaceful that I fell asleep! And <em>hup</em>, down I fell.
I broke my arm so badly, they had to give me poppy juice and cut it open to straighten out the bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d break my arm myself if it would stop Hediyeh and the others from playing stupid tricks on me,&rdquo; I grumbled.
I picked up a black pawn, put my hands behind my back, then held my fists out to him.</p>
<p>Razi didn&rsquo;t tap one.
Instead, he snapped his fingers against bad luck.
&ldquo;You should be careful what you ask for,&rdquo; he warned me.
&ldquo;<em>La</em>, and even more careful what you offer in return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew that tone of voice, and the look in his eyes.
All of a sudden I was even angrier than I had been when I cut my thumb.
What right did he have to pity me?
He was as <em>nif</em> as I was!
&ldquo;Well, are you going to choose or not?&rdquo; I asked, waving my fists above the board.</p>
<p>He reached out as if to choose a hand, then grabbed my wrists.
&ldquo;Open up,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ow!&rdquo; I opened my hands.
The black pawn I had taken from the chessboard lay in one.
The one I had spent the day carving lay in the other.</p>
<p>Razi laughed.
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll take white,&rdquo; he said, letting go of my wrists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>He grinned and pointed at the chessboard.
&ldquo;You forgot to pick up a white one,&rdquo; he told me.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to try to trick someone, <em>la</em>, you must plan more than one move ahead.&rdquo;
He scratched the side of his nose.
&ldquo;For example, think about—what&rsquo;s her name? Hediyeh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not,&rdquo; I said sourly.
I had spent hours carving that pawn…</p>
<p>He shook his head.
&ldquo;Just because you can&rsquo;t <em>drome</em>, it doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re deaf and blind.
Look at pocket mice.
They can&rsquo;t <em>drome</em> either, but have you ever tried to sneak up on one?
They&rsquo;re always listening, always sniffing the air.
If you listen that hard, and learn to pay attention, no-one will ever be able to sneak up on you.
And if you learn to be as still inside as a piece of glass, then one day maybe you will be able to sneak up on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo; I was so frustrated that my voice broke.</p>
<p>Razi shrugged his shoulders and twisted his right hand around, all in one smooth motion.
Just like that he had a short, sharp knife in his hand.
The blade was blackened, but sunlight glinted on its edge.
&ldquo;I can teach you, if you want,&rdquo;
he said quietly.</p>
<p>I stared at the knife like a pocket mouse staring at a snake.
Razi was more than just a wandering <em>nif</em> tinker,
and he was offering me far more than I had realized I was bargaining for.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p>Five years later Razi sat cross-legged in front of his tent in the lemon grove,
weighing feathers in the tin pans of a little balance.
&ldquo;Have you eaten?&rdquo; he asked without looking up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.
And I brought date bread for lunch.
<em>Umma</em> made it yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded.
&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;
He took one of the sand-brown feathers from the balance and trimmed it with his knife.
&ldquo;Canteens are in the tent.
We&rsquo;ll need one each, and a spare.&rdquo;
The balance leveled.
Razi set the feather aside, then removed another one from the bag beside him.</p>
<p>By the time I had filled the canteens and returned,
Razi had trimmed a dozen feathers to exactly the same weight.
He laid them flat in a folded square of paper so that they wouldn&rsquo;t be crushed.
&ldquo;Finish those later,&rdquo; he said, standing and stretching.
He stooped and pulled his bow case from his tent.
It was a long tube of hard brown leather as tall as I was.
A second tube, shorter and fatter, was his quiver.
Any feather on any arrow in that quiver would level the balance with any other.</p>
<p>The last thing he took was a dark green bottle wrapped in woven leather plaits.
Its stopper was a sword hilt with a plain leather grip.
Razi hung it on his left hip and grinned at me.
&ldquo;All set?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded.
My bow was slung over my shoulder in the padded cloth case my mother had made for it.
I had fifteen arrows, each with a barbed steel head, and a machete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Razi.
He clapped me on the shoulder.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go hunting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Razi led us south, skirting the ruins of the Pilots&rsquo; palace before turning inland toward the watchtower.
We played chess as we walked, each telling the other a move every fifty paces.
It&rsquo;s harder than it sounds:
not only do you have to keep the position in your head,
you have to think of a plan while you&rsquo;re counting paces.
It was fun,
but it was also another of Razi&rsquo;s exercises,
training me to keep track of time and distance while I was worrying about other things.</p>
<p>Time and distance are what the desert is about.
How far am I travelling?
When will I run out of water?
After Razi said, &ldquo;Checkmate,&rdquo; time and distance filled my thoughts.
How much longer would I stay in Medef?
How far could I go when I left?
The furthest I&rsquo;d ever been was Uef.
It was a tenth the size of Medef, just thirty families living around a spring three days away.
I wanted to see Ossisswe, and Ruuda, and Ini Bantang, and, oh, the whole world.
I wanted to see what a city looked like, a city full of <em>nif</em> like me.
I wanted to have adventures
so that I could come back to Medef to tell stories and have girls like Hediyeh blush and giggle when I walked by,
the way they blushed and giggled around the <em>nif</em> traders when they passed through.</p>
<p>I put one foot in front of the other, taking four steps for every three of Razi&rsquo;s.
The sun was half-way to noon when Razi turned east.
We circled around the watchtower hill so that we could come at it from the side closest to the Sea of Glass.
I tried to figure out his plan while we walked.
We would reach the tower mid-afternoon.
That didn&rsquo;t make sense: at that time of day, the breeze would carry our scent straight to the gargoyles.
Unless…</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>La</em>, am I to be bait?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>Razi shook his head.
&ldquo;No, I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We reached the beach an hour later.
It was an eerie place.
A thousand years of dry wind had scoured most of the sand away,
leaving a glass shelf that rippled with the shape of ancient waves.
Pieces had cracked and broken over the years,
littering the rock below with sharp-edged shards that could cut even the sturdiest sole.</p>
<p>Razi pointed.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a path down there by three rocks that look like a mother goat and two kids.
Do you know it?&rdquo;
I nodded.
&ldquo;Work your way up behind them.
I&rsquo;ll come at them from below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded again.
&ldquo;How will I know when you&rsquo;re ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grinned.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took me half an hour to get in position.
I moved from rock to bush,
never taking more than a dozen steps at once,
scanning the sky for slow-circling wings before picking my way to the next bit of cover.
I tried to keep my mind clear, to think only about the next few steps.
I was just a pocket mouse—no,
not even that,
just a wind-blown scrap of tumbleweed.</p>
<p>I was about five hundred paces from the watchtower when the first gargoyle launched herself into the air.
She didn&rsquo;t start flying right away.
Instead,
she plummeted earthward down the side of the tower for a moment to build up speed,
then snapped her wings open with a <em>crack</em>
and began spiralling back into the sky on a warm updraft.</p>
<p>I crouched behind the eroded remains of an old wall and slipped my bow out of its case.
I had waxed its string that morning when I was unable to sleep.
There, in the moment, I cursed the faint honey smell that still lingered.
I slipped one loop into the catch at the bottom end of the bow,
braced it against my foot,
then bent it and hooked the other end of the string in place in a single motion
the way Razi had taught me.</p>
<p>I swallowed a mouthful of water and set my canteen down in the wall&rsquo;s narrow shadow.
I still had some date bread,
but I couldn&rsquo;t have eaten it then for its weight in pewter.
Instead I pulled the drawstrings at my wrists and ankles tight
so that my sleeves and pantlegs wouldn&rsquo;t catch on anything.</p>
<p>The second female launched herself from the tower.
As she rose to follow the first one
I slipped around the end of the ruined wall and sprinted to the candelilla bush I&rsquo;d chosen as my next patch of cover.
I had hunted jackrabbits and sand gulls this way,
watching for the moments when my prey looked away,
inching closer a few paces each time.</p>
<p>Suddenly one of the gargoyles stooped, yipping at the other.
My breath caught.
It must be Razi.
I slipped two arrows from my quiver, put one between my teeth, and raised my head.</p>
<p>The third gargoyle, the male, took wing just as I looked up.
His wingspan was twice that of the females,
and his voice boomed instead of shrieking when he answered their call.
He flapped its wings to gain height.
The two females circled him as he climbed, all three calling to each other.</p>
<p>Razi broke cover and ran straight for the tower,
holding his bow in both hands like a spear for balance.
One of the females screeched and plummeted at him, arms outstretched.
Razi threw himself sideways at the last moment,
rolled over,
and came up on one knee to fire an arrow I hadn&rsquo;t even seen him draw.
It punched through the taut skin of the gargoyle&rsquo;s wing.</p>
<p>The other female swooped in behind her,
herding Razi toward the waiting male who would make the kill.
I sighted,
leading her,
time and distance made reflex by long hours of practice.</p>
<p>Razi ran again toward the tower again.
The second female swooped across his path to cut him off.
He checked himself so that she overshot,
but the male was right behind her.
Razi jabbed at him with his bow.
The male stumbled in the air as it hit his wing,
one taloned foot raking Razi&rsquo;s scalp.</p>
<p>I fired my first arrow as the male started to climb.
It passed harmlessly behind him.
I pulled another from my quiver.
I could taste the one between my teeth,
my snapshot arrow.</p>
<p>There was blood on Razi&rsquo;s face.
He had two arrows out himself, one in his teeth, one strung.
As the first female dove a second time, he fired, drew, fired again.
The second shot hit her shoulder, cutting some vital muscle or tendon.
Her wing crumpled.
She tumbled sideways.</p>
<p>The male bellowed five stories above Razi&rsquo;s head.
I drew, exhaled, and let fly.
My arrow hit him square in the chest.
The impact knocked him sideways in the air.
My snapshot arrow struck his leg a moment later,
but I think he was already dead.
He turned over once as he fell.</p>
<p>The second female shrieked and banked away.
I saw Razi aim, then lower his bow.
She was too far away and moving too fast.</p>
<p>I ran to him as he wiped blood from his face with his sleeve.
&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>He glared at his sleeve as if blaming it for being stained.
&ldquo;No. Where&rsquo;s the spare canteen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have it,&rdquo; I said, pointing.
He turned his glare on me.
Then his look softened and he chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>La</em>, so I do.&rdquo;
He handed me his bow, unstoppered the canteen, and splashed some water onto his face.
&ldquo;Gaaah… I&rsquo;m a mess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something rustled behind me.
I whirled around.
The female that Razi had shot had struggled to her feet.
Her right wing hung uselessly at her side.
She chittered,
clutching feebly at the arrow that had passed through the complicated double joint where arm and wing joined body.</p>
<p>Razi wiped some more blood from his face.
&ldquo;Here, give me that.&rdquo;
He took his bow back from me and drew an arrow.
The female just stood there on her short, bandy legs and watched with all-too-human eyes
as Razi sighted carefully and put an arrow through her heart.</p>
