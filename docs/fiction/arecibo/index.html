<h1>Arecibo Mon Amour</h1>



<ol id="toc"></ol>

<section>
<h2>Wurdi Youang / 8980 BCE</h2>
<p>She gave up her name long ago:
it was too heavy to carry into the Dreaming.
She missed it at first,
but everyone who knew her by that name is dead now,
and it amuses her when others call her the Old Woman behind her back.
She really ought to tell them that being partly blind doesn&rsquo;t affect her hearing…</p>
<p>Footsteps crunch on the gravel bank behind her.
She sighs as the blackfish she was trying to catch darts away.
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; she asks,
the river caressing her knees as she turns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Wharru,&rdquo; the young man says.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a stranger in camp.&rdquo;
Wharru is one of the new arrivals,
still thin and angry after his long trek from the drowning lands.
His clan lost their farms to the ever-rising sea,
and many were killed or enslaved.
He is often angry at small things,
but he has helped her realign stones without complaint
and doesn&rsquo;t snore or fart as much as some.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From down below?&rdquo; she asks,
sloshing through the river to join him.</p>
<p>Wharru hesitates.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.
He&rsquo;s not like any real people I&rsquo;ve ever seen.
Alinta thinks he might be a bad spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feh.&rdquo;
The old woman picks up the walking stick and skin bag
that are everything she owns.
&ldquo;Alinta thinks <em>everyone</em> is a bad spirit.
Let&rsquo;s go say hello.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger isn&rsquo;t in camp.
&ldquo;I told him to wait for you,&rdquo;
Alinta says,
her voice as sharp as the stone knife in her hand.
&ldquo;I told him it&rsquo;s a powerful place,
you shouldn&rsquo;t go there without her,
but he didn&rsquo;t listen.&rdquo;
She sets her knife aside,
grabs the gweela&rsquo;s feet with one hand,
and pulls hard with the other.
The bird&rsquo;s skin comes off with a sound like a wet slap.</p>
<p>The old woman suppresses a sigh.
Everyone doing chores within earshot has paused to listen to Alinta.
They will follow her when the old woman dies;
in her heart,
she knows that will be the end of the stones.</p>
<p>She jerks her chin at the carcass in Alinta&rsquo;s hand.
&ldquo;Enough there for company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alinta scowls.
&ldquo;Hardly enough for <em>us</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, do what you can.&rdquo;
She digs her elbow into Wharru&rsquo;s ribs.
&ldquo;Come on.
Let&rsquo;s go see what this evil spirit wants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walk side by side through the long shadows beneath the gum trees.
The old woman has been going up and down the mountain for almost thirty years,
and takes quiet pleasure in thinking that
the packed earth is echoing her own footsteps back at her.
Crickets and songbirds fill the forest with sound.
Wharru hefts his spear when something larger rustles the bushes.
The old woman pushes on:
a thylacine wouldn&rsquo;t attack two people together,
and no one has seen a marsupial lion for years.</p>
<p>They reach the field of stones just as the sun kisses the horizon.
Only a few scattered clouds mar the sky&rsquo;s perfect blue;
if the stranger wasn&rsquo;t there the old woman would have Wharru
sight along the stones for her to check their positions.</p>
<p>But the stranger <em>is</em> there,
and even half-blind from years of looking too closely at the sun,
the old woman thinks that for once Alinta might be right.
He is taller than anyone she has ever seen and completely hairless.
An angry young scar mars his left temple,
rough and red against his near-black skin.
When he turns, she blinks.
His little man is as small as a baby&rsquo;s and he has no bag at all that she can see.</p>
<p>She clears her throat,
but before her greeting leaves her mouth he says,
&ldquo;It does not measure well enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wharru straightens.
&ldquo;Show respect,&rdquo; he says sharply.</p>
<p>She puts a hand on his arm.
&ldquo;What do you mean, not well enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger gestures at the oval of basalt that the old woman has spent a lifetime assembling.
There are one hundred and twenty one stones,
each with a name known only to the old woman and whoever helped her place it.
She could pick some up one-handed,
but others took two strong men and a travois to move,
and the waist-high trio at the oval&rsquo;s sunset end
had been a year of hard work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need to know—&rdquo;
The stranger frowns, seeming confused.
&ldquo;This language does not have the words.
I can only be heard at some moments,
but I am damaged.&rdquo;
He gestures at the scar on his head.
&ldquo;I do not know when those moments are any more.
I must measure to find them,
but this does not measure well enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman clucks her tongue.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.
Do you want to add a stone?&rdquo;
Is part of his spirit lost in the Dreaming?
She has seen it before.
A man was struck in a fight.
When he woke two days later
he moved slowly and was confused by the simplest things.</p>
<p>The stranger shakes his head.
&ldquo;No.
This language does not have the words.&rdquo;
He sounds almost petulant.
&ldquo;I need to count the spaces between the stars.
What you have built does measure well enough.
It is of no use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is of great use!&rdquo; Wharru says hotly.
&ldquo;It tells us the moon&rsquo;s path and when the seasons will turn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger looks at the old woman without replying.
<em>He knows,</em> she realizes with a shock.
He knows the same thing she knows,
that there are patterns in the stars and the lights that wander among them,
and that those patterns <em>mean</em> something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must search elsewhere,&rdquo; the stranger says abruptly.
With nothing more than that he starts to walk past them.</p>
<p>Wharru steps into his path.
&ldquo;Are all your kin so rude?&rdquo; he demands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wharru, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the old woman protests,
but he ignores her.
He fought and killed on his way to the mountain,
and in that sunset moment she can see his hurts
in the way he shifts his weight,
readying to strike.</p>
<p>But that blow never comes.
With a rasping roar,
the lion that had crept closer while they were distracted
bursts out of the trees behind them.</p>
<p>The old woman screams as it knocks her to the ground.
A dazzling pain shoots up her spine as her hip breaks,
then something cracks and the lion goes limp.
The stranger has broken its neck with a single blow.</p>
<p>Wharru drops to his knees beside her.
&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; he shouts
as the stranger turns to go.
&ldquo;She needs help!
She&rsquo;ll die if we don&rsquo;t help her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger cocks his head.
&ldquo;She will die anyway.&rdquo;
He walks away without another word.</p>
<p><em>Wharru tries to carry the old woman,
but each step he takes makes her whimper.
She eventually convinces him to leave her long enough to get help.
Both are surprised that she is still alive when he returns.</em></p>
<p><em>Later,
Alinta pokes at the lion&rsquo;s protruding ribs
and says it must have been desperate with hunger.
It is the last one anyone ever sees.
She makes a cloak from its pelt,
but it is lost in a fire many years later.
The old woman lives another season,
but is never able to go back up the mountain to look at the sky.
With her last thought she wonders if the stranger ever found a way to count the spaces between the stars.</em></p>

<h2>Chankillo / 380 BCE</h2>
<p>As a child,
Second Bird&rsquo;s diet consisted of maize, beans, the occasional roasted guinea pig,
and his grandfather&rsquo;s stories.
The First People rose up against the highlanders&rsquo; god-king many times.
Each rebellion ended in death for some
and harsher conditions for the rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we <em>learned</em>,&rdquo; Fast Rock says,
grunting as he turns over a spadeful of damp soil.
Clearing irrigation channels is slippery, back-breaking work,
but Second Bird doesn&rsquo;t mind.
Other chores are just as hard,
and he enjoys his grandfather&rsquo;s stories.</p>
<p>Fast Rock drives his spade into the ground again.
&ldquo;The trick was,&rdquo;
heave,
&ldquo;We all had,&rdquo;
heave,
&ldquo;To rise,&rdquo;
heave,
&ldquo;together.&rdquo;
He pauses to wipe sweat from his brow
while Second Bird drags the reed basket of soil out of the way.</p>
<p>Without warning the ground shakes.
Ripples dance across the water in the channel.
Someone shouts a warning.
Someone else screams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather!&rdquo;
He grabs Fast Rock&rsquo;s outstretched hand and pulls the old man up onto the bank.
Dry soil loosened by the earthquake slumps into the channel,
undoing a day&rsquo;s work.
Fast Rock curses.
&ldquo;With me!&rdquo; he orders,
setting off toward the village at a trot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo; Second Bird asks,
running after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The evil one,&rdquo; Fast Rock says grimly.
&ldquo;He must not escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every handspan of green land was a gift from the gods.
Even the highlanders understood that,
and built their villages where the green ended and the hard dry desert began.
Most of those villages are home now only to wild animals and ghosts.
Second Bird has ventured into the one nearby on a dare,
marveling at the carved stones,
but he has never gone to the center.
He is not a man yet,
and even men only go there in pairs.</p>
<p>Two more buildings have collapsed.
The old man spits on them as they hurry past.
The sooner they come down,
the sooner the gods will come back and end the drought.</p>
<p>They round the last corner to find a nightmare.
The highlanders&rsquo; god-king stands in front of the collapsed wall
of the storehouse where the First People imprisoned him twenty years ago.
Two men stand opposite him,
spears in their hands.
They are brave,
but it took a dozen men to subdue him during the rising.</p>
<p>Fast Rock draws his knife from his belt and advances slowly.
One of the guards shifts to make space for him
without taking his eyes off the god-king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Fast Rock says after a moment.
&ldquo;What now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The god-king is a head taller than anyone Second Bird has ever seen,
with skin like charcoal and an old scar on the left side of his head.
Naked,
bone thin from two decades of starvation,
and covered in dust,
he is the most frightening thing Second Bird has ever seen.</p>
<p>The god-king blinks as if waking.
&ldquo;I need to see the stars,&rdquo; he says abruptly,
then turns and walks away.</p>
<p>The two guards look at Fast Rock helplessly.
&ldquo;Get help,&rdquo; the old man orders,
taking the nearest one&rsquo;s spear.
&ldquo;Get <em>everyone</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo;
he bellows.
The guard takes off at a run.</p>
<p>Fast Rock bares his teeth.
&ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They follow the god-king into the desert.
At first Second Bird thinks he is leading them to
the fortress the highlanders built when they first conquered the valley,
but he walks past it without a glance.
That leaves the towers,
thirteen of them on a ridge looking west,
built with stone and the sweat of the First People.</p>
<p>Others join them.
Some have spears,
others whatever tools they were using when the earth shook.
Two men have thought to bring a net like the one Fast Rock and his companions used
to snare the god-king all those years ago,
and an old woman has a pouch of herbs for wounds.</p>
<p>By the time they reach the ridge the god-king has climbed the tallest tower.
&ldquo;Should we set an ambush?&rdquo; one of the men carrying the net hisses at Fast Rock.</p>
<p>The old man snorts.
There is no way to get above the tower stairs and nothing to hide behind.
He gestures at the nearest men.
&ldquo;Spread out.
When he comes down, you three get behind him, but wait for my word.
We must all attack at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attack?&rdquo;
one man says incredulously.
&ldquo;<em>Him?</em>&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is weak,&rdquo;
Fast Rock says curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t <em>look</em> weak,&rdquo; the man says under his breath,
but he takes a position.</p>
<p>Second Bird swallows drily.
The First People had argued endlessly over what to do with the captured god-king.
Shedding a god&rsquo;s blood was unthinkable,
but if they drove him into the desert,
what would stop him from returning some day?
So they had walled him up inside one of his own storehouses to die,
which he had stubbornly refused to do.</p>
<p>They wait.
And wait.
Finally Fast Rock cups his hands around his mouth.
&ldquo;What are you doing up there?&rdquo; he shouts.</p>
<p>People gasp.
Evil or not, you don&rsquo;t yell at gods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am looking at the stars,&rdquo;
the god-king replies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bit early for that, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Fast Rock asks loudly.
&ldquo;I mean, wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to wait until they&rsquo;re actually there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stars are always there.&rdquo;
There is a moment of silence.
&ldquo;It is good to see them again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Second Bird looks questioningly at his grandfather.
The old man shrugs,
then tenses as the god-king trudges down the steps.</p>
<p>The men shuffle into a semi-circle as he reaches the bottom.
The god-king looks past them at the thin green ribbon of life running through the desert.
&ldquo;The river is shrinking,&rdquo;
he says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will come back,&rdquo;
Fast Rock says.</p>
<p>The god-king shakes his head.
&ldquo;No.
There is a new—&rdquo; he hesitates.
&ldquo;Balance.
A new balance of long weather.
This valley can no longer sustain as many people as my work needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He takes a step forward,
pulling up short when the tip of Fast Rock&rsquo;s spear touches his chest.
&ldquo;Your &lsquo;work&rsquo;?&rdquo; the old man snarls.
&ldquo;We <em>died</em> here, monster!
We died and died to build this,
and for what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To measure the stars,&rdquo;
the god-king says evenly.
&ldquo;I need to measure them very exactly to know when I can be heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you can be <em>heard</em>?&rdquo; Fast Rock snarls.
&ldquo;We <em>bled</em>, monster.
We <em>died</em>.
We bowed our heads for a hundred years,
just so you could be <em>heard</em>?&rdquo;
He lunges.</p>
<p>The god-king grabs the spear just behind the point and snaps it one-handed.
The two men with the net shuffle their feet but make no move.
Others heft their weapons and tools.</p>
<p>Fast Rock spits at the god-king&rsquo;s feet.
&ldquo;So now what?
Are we to be your slaves again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The god-king shakes his head.
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
For the first time Second Bird hears emotion in his voice—regret,
perhaps,
or something close to it.
&ldquo;Pyramids, henges, towers—sooner or later you always rebel.
I must find a way to make you want to build my tools yourself.&rdquo;
Without another word he turns and walks into the desert.</p>
<p>Second Bird looks at his grandfather.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a &lsquo;pyramid&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>The river that sustains the First People never dries up,
but it thins and wanders.
Many years later,
Second Bird tells his grandchildren the story
and shows them how to predict the seasons by the way certain stars line up with the towers.
As he falls asleep for the last time
he wonders if the god-king ever found someone who wanted to build what he needed.</em></p>

<h2>Gyeongju / 720 CE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It was Her Majesty&rsquo;s first decree,&rdquo;
the young astrologer says,
immediately hating himself for telling such a distinguished scholar
something he undoubtedly already knows.</p>
<p>The visitor from the Middle Kingdom smiles politely as he studies the star-gazing tower.
It is the height of five men,
and to educated eyes
the number and placement of its stones represent historical and astronomical figures.
&ldquo;I understand her decision was not universally popular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young astrologer inclines his head.
&ldquo;Not universally popular&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t quite capture the way the aristocracy felt
about a woman ascending to the throne,
but it would be imprudent to mention that with two guards standing just a few feet away,
particularly when rumors of Her Majesty&rsquo;s illness flutter around the court like pigeons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this must be your barbarian,&rdquo;
the visitor continues
as a tall figure in the plain brown robe of a monk
comes up the gravel path in the waning light.</p>
<p>The young astrologer inclines his head again.
He is no longer taken aback by the foreigner&rsquo;s black skin,
but will not notice how gracefully he walks.
&ldquo;Are you at peace?&rdquo; he asks in greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, and you?&rdquo;
He is barefoot again,
the young astrologer notes,
but according to his servants he has at least eaten that day.
Her Majesty&rsquo;s minister insists on regular reports,
which the young astrologer fills with trivia
rather than with the unorthodox things the foreigner sometimes says.</p>
<p>He clears his throat.
&ldquo;I have the honor of introducing you to scholar Liu Zhao,
who has come from the court of the Gaozong Emperor.
I apologize for any appearance of poor manners,&rdquo;
he continues hurriedly to the scholar,
&ldquo;But my colleague has no name by which to be introduced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scholar Liu raises a perfectly groomed eyebrow.
&ldquo;Not even a temple name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not a monk,&rdquo;
the foreigner says.
&ldquo;I have simply forgotten it.&rdquo;
He brushes a finger over the old scar that wrinkles the side of his head.</p>
<p>Scholar Liu inclines his head.
&ldquo;There are those who spend their lifetimes trying to let go of such things.&rdquo;
He gestures at the tower.
&ldquo;Or to build such marvels as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The foreigner nods.
&ldquo;It has been very useful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo;
Scholar Liu jerks his chin at the scrolls tucked into the foreigner&rsquo;s satchel.
&ldquo;I have heard much about the records you have made.
I am told they are extremely precise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The foreigner shrugs.
&ldquo;As precise as they can be.
Improving them will be the work of many lifetimes.&rdquo;
The young astrologer is relieved that
the foreigner doesn&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;Many of <em>your</em> lifetimes,&rdquo;
as he used to.</p>
<p>He opens his mouth to suggest that they climb the tower,
but is interrupted by a shout.
A guard runs up the path to join them.
&ldquo;Her Majesty…&rdquo; he pants,
speaking to the two escorts rather than to the scholars.
&ldquo;Her Majesty is gone. She is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The buzz of evening insects fills the shocked silence that follows.
&ldquo;Stay here,&rdquo;
the oldest guard orders his partner.
He hurries away with the messenger in tow,
their armor clanking in time with their steps.
Queen Seondeok&rsquo;s desire for her cousin to succeed her is well known,
but it has only been a week since her chief minister led an abortive rebellion,
and only a day since he and thirty of his followers were beheaded.</p>
<p>Scholar Liu waits for them to vanish among the ornamental bushes,
then gestures to the remaining guard.
<em>He has been bribed,</em> the young astrologer realizes
as the guard steps out of earshot.
It is hardly surprising:
he has bribed guards himself on occasion.
He suspects he has paid them more than he needed to.</p>
<p>Scholar Liu turns to the foreigner.
&ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo;
he says without preamble.
&ldquo;Come with me to the court of the Gaozong Emperor.
We will build a tower twice the height of this <em>cheomseongdae</em>
and you will have a dozen scribes to record your every thought.&rdquo;
He steps closer,
lowering his voice as if seducing a lady of the court.
&ldquo;It need not be the work of many lifetimes.
We can find the key to all knowledge in <em>this</em> one.&rdquo;
He glances at the young astrologer.
&ldquo;You can even bring your companion if you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young astrologer blushes furiously.
The word Scholar Liu has used for companion—the implications of it—he
has fantasized about such a thing,
but has never dared act.
The shame it would bring his family if they were caught,
not to mention the impossible awkwardness of trying to raise the subject
with someone he practically worshipped—</p>
<p>But the foreigner is shaking his head.
&ldquo;You would not have come this far to make such an offer
unless you already had the Emperor&rsquo;s favor or were desperate for it,
and if you already had it,
you would say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ingratiating expression on Scholar Liu&rsquo;s face melts,
leaving anger in its wake.
&ldquo;So you consider yourself an expert on the court as well as the stars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The foreigner inclines his head.
&ldquo;Sadly,
I suspect little has changed since I served the Emperor Taiwu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scholar Liu snorts.
&ldquo;That was two hundred years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless.&rdquo;
The foreigner gestures at the tower.
&ldquo;You are of course still welcome to join us tonight.
If it is clear,
I may be able to show you the slow wanderer we have found beyond Saturn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scholar scowls.
&ldquo;You speak nonsense.
Come!&rdquo;
He snaps his fingers at the guard and stalks away like an affronted cat.</p>
<p>The young astrologer turns to the foreigner.
&ldquo;Being invited to the emperor&rsquo;s court is a great honor,&rdquo;
he ventures cautiously.
&ldquo;There are many fine scholars there with whom you could converse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The foreigner inclines his head again.
&ldquo;I find no deficiency of any kind in those I know here.&rdquo;
And for the first time,
he smiles.</p>
<p><em>The succession proves peaceful.
The young astrologer grows to middle age,
successfully evading all of the marriage traps set by his extended family.
He gets mildly drunk one night to celebrate the prediction of a lunar eclipse
and finally acts on twenty years of desire
by reciting a love poem to the foreigner on top of the star-gazing tower.
When he wakes the next morning the foreigner has vanished.</em></p>

<h2>Maragheh / 1320 CE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;But you could take the books.&rdquo;
Batu has led his <em>arban</em> halfway across Asia.
They have fought Uzbeks,
Pathans,
Persians,
bandits,
Turks,
and even a company of Franks
who somehow found themselves east of the Black Sea.
His men have heard him bellow orders and sing in a surprisingly melodious voice,
but they have never heard him be as sarcastic as this.</p>
<p>Otgon hefts the golden candlestick he holds
as if wondering whether it&rsquo;s too late to hide it behind his back.
&ldquo;Yes sir.
There are some tapestries too, and a samovar.
He says we can have all of it as long as we leave the books alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How kind of him,&rdquo; Batu says acidly.
&ldquo;Tell me—does he <em>look</em> mad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sir. He looks Ethiopian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who does?&rdquo;
Batu glances over his shoulder at the question,
then drops to one knee.
His <em>arban</em> follow suit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My <em>beg</em>,&rdquo;
he says,
eyes fixed on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up, get up.&rdquo;
Mirza Muhammad Taraghay bin Shahrukh wears a quilted jacket like his troops,
though his is fine silk instead of homespun linen.
His personal guard stands behind him,
blades bared and eyes constantly moving.
Maragheh hadn&rsquo;t put up much of a fight,
but bows are plentiful and the <em>beg</em> has many enemies.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this about an Ethiopian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Batu gets to his feet,
careful not to wince at the protest from his knee.
&ldquo;Up the hill, my <em>beg</em>.
Some crazy man saying we can have the gold if we leave the books.&rdquo;
He snaps his fingers at Otgon,
who holds up the candlestick like a child showing a toy he has made.</p>
<p>The <em>beg</em> narrows his eyes.
&ldquo;An Ethiopian?
Come, let us see what he has to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Batu and his <em>arban</em> follow the <em>beg</em>&rsquo;s entourage up the hill.
&ldquo;Tuck it under your coat,&rdquo;
Batu mutters to Otgon.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re lucky, he&rsquo;ll forget you have it.&rdquo;
<em>If you&rsquo;re very lucky,</em> he amends in his head.
The man people call Ulugh Beg—Great Ruler—is famous for his intelligence.
Still,
one can always hope…</p>
<p>The observatory was a marvel in its heyday,
but time, neglect, and decades of minor earthquakes
have brought one wall down completely
and left others leaning perilously.
The <em>beg</em> picks his way across the cracked courtyard tiles
to a door that still hangs true in its frame.
To Batu&rsquo;s surprise he pauses as if unsure of himself before knocking.
&ldquo;Peace be upon you,&rdquo; he calls.
&ldquo;May we enter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you must,&rdquo;
a weary voice replies.</p>
<p>The <em>beg</em> looks at the captain of his personal guard,
who looks at Batu,
who looks at Otgon,
who salues,
hands the candlestick to his brother,
and opens the door.
Batu follows him through with the <em>beg</em> behind him.</p>
<p>Batu has never seen a library before.
For a moment he feels the same way he did when his father first took him to Samarkand.
How could there be so <em>much</em> in the world?</p>
<p>Then the room&rsquo;s resident stirs and Batu&rsquo;s attention snaps back to the here and now.
The Ethiopian wears the simple white robe of a pilgrim.
A samovar stands near his elbow,
and the tools of a tailor and a leatherworker are laid out neatly on the table for mending books.</p>
<p>He stands and bows.
The <em>beg</em> returns it as though to an equal.
&ldquo;I have been looking forward to meeting you,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>The Ethiopian cocks his head quizzically.
&ldquo;One of my tutors spoke of you,&rdquo;
the <em>beg</em> continues.
&ldquo;He studied trigonometry with the great al-Tusi,
peace be upon him,
and showed me a copy of the <em>zij</em> you drew up.
It was…&rdquo;
The <em>beg</em> spreads his hands as if words alone could not capture what it was.</p>
<p>The Ethiopian sighs.
&ldquo;It was the best start I have ever made,&rdquo; he says.
&ldquo;I thought—&rdquo;
He blinks,
and for a moment Batu thinks he is going to cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I could make some real progress this time,&rdquo;
the Ethiopian continues quietly,
more to himself than to the <em>beg</em> or his soldiers.
&ldquo;When al-Tusi persuaded the great khan to build this
I thought I would finally be able to get past the bare beginning,
but…&rdquo;
He gestures at the ruined walls.</p>
<p>The <em>beg</em> points at Batu.
&ldquo;You.
How many men in your <em>arban</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine, <em>beg</em>,&rdquo; the old soldier says promptly.
He clears his throat.
&ldquo;Should be ten, but Dzhambul took an arrow in the leg and —&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <em>beg</em> cuts him off with a wave.
&ldquo;And you fight together, yes?
You stand watch while each other sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <em>beg</em>,&rdquo; Batu says.
He learned long ago not to ask officers what point they were trying to make.</p>
<p>The <em>beg</em> turns back to the Ethiopian.
&ldquo;What if I built you a school in Samarkand?
What if you taught others the method of triangles and all of al-Tusi&rsquo;s other arts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the Ethiopian says,
the weight of ages in his voice.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not allowed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not allowed?&rdquo; the <em>beg</em> says,
theatrically astonished.
&ldquo;Not allowed by whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ethiopian shakes his head.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember.
There is so much I can&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo;
He brushes his fingers over the scar on his temple.</p>
<p>The <em>beg</em> cocks his head.
&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re just going to give up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ethiopian looks up at him,
and this time there actually are tears in his eyes.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that either,&rdquo; he whispers.
He bows his head for a moment,
then stands and begins to gather the few books he will bring with him.</p>
<p><em>Otgon dies when a Georgian knifes him in a campfire squabble over a game of dice.
Batu loses an arm in battle outside Balkh,
but finds a position as a caretaker at the new observatory in Samarkand.
The beg&rsquo;s catalog of the positions of 994 stars,
known as the Zij-i-Sultani,

<h2>Venice / 1610 CE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Master, you have another visitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Galileo di Vincenzo Bonaiuti de&rsquo; Galilei waves the servant off
without taking his eye away from his telescope.
He has demonstrated his new instrument to one group of Venetian notables after another.
At this point they are either going to back him or not,
and if they don&rsquo;t,
someone else will.</p>
<p>The servant clears his throat.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, master, but he is quite insistent.&rdquo;
The boy hesitates.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a Moor, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Galileo sighs as a wisp of cirrus drifts in front of the Moon.
&ldquo;Very well, show him up.
And bring me something to eat!&rdquo;
he calls as the boy hurries away.
&ldquo;Something with some meat in it!&rdquo;
La Serenissima is damper than he is used to,
and even with a blanket over his legs he will feel the cold by morning.</p>
<p>The boy—Marco? Matteo? The astronomer doesn&rsquo;t remember—ushers the visitor onto the terrace
a few moments later.
Galileo takes in his dark skin and rich, plain clothes at a glance.
The scar on his temple is too ragged to have been made by a sword.
A brand, perhaps?
&ldquo;<em>Buona sera</em>,&rdquo; he says without standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Buona sera</em>,&rdquo; the visitor replies.
&ldquo;I apologize for intruding,
but I have heard that you have made—&rdquo;
He hesitates,
his eyes drawn to the brass cylinder on the table behind his host.
&ldquo;Something miraculous,&rdquo; he finishes reverently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No no no,&rdquo; Galileo says hastily.
The last thing he needs now is trouble with the church.
&ldquo;There is nothing miraculous about it.
It is just lenses.
And there are many practical applications,
military and commercial alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are unimportant,&rdquo; the Moor says dismissively.</p>
<p>Galileo bridles.
&ldquo;Your master may think otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger blinks, puzzled.
&ldquo;I have no master.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Then you should not be walking around Venice after dark,</em>
Galileo thinks.</p>
<p>FIXME: this is the turn.</p>
<p><em>By the time Galileo dies in 1642 there are over a thousand refracting telescopes in the world.
Twenty-five years later, Isaac Newton builds the first reflecting telescope;
a generation after that,
astronomical catalogs list the positions of thousands of stars
that are invisible to the naked eye.</em></p>

<h2>Delhi / 1875 CE</h2>
<p>He wears civilian clothes now,
but he will always think of himself as Corporal Singh.
A button from his first Company uniform lies in a box under his bed.
It was called the Raj by the time he retired,
or more accurately,
by the time a quiet Englishman who spoke nearly perfect Punjabi
had a quiet word with him in an out-of-the-way office
about how else he might be able to serve.</p>
<p>That was almost twenty years ago.
The Rebellion had been put down,
but everyone—British and Indian alike—believed
it was just a matter of time until the flame caught again.
&ldquo;Eyes and ears, corporal,&rdquo; the Englishman said.
&ldquo;We need people who can see things and hear things
that someone like me will never see or hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So now he walks further each day than he used to march,
though without a pack or a rifle to weigh him down.
Past the Delhi Gate and down the old Ansari Road
or through the cacaphony of Chawri bazaar,
he visits one informant here and another there,
never in the same order or at the same time of day.</p>
<p>Today is different.
Today he is following a tall black man who slips through the crowd
like a fish through water.
He wears a simple white robe and a crocheted white topi.
His sandals look sturdy,
as does the satchel slung over his shoulder.
Corporal Singh almost didn&rsquo;t notice him when he disembarked from the 6:18 am train,
but then the light caught the scar on his temple
and the corporal immediately thought,
hello,
what are <em>you</em> doing <em>here</em>?</p>
<p>The corporal hangs back a double dozen strides.
Africans are not unknown in Delhi,
but are uncommon enough that heads turn as he walks by.
Tailors and cobblers and haberdashers call to the stranger
as he walks through the market on Janpath Road.
He inclines his head to some but otherwise ignores them.
Another few hundred yards—the corporal is sweating slightly in the morning sun—and
they reach the small park that is home to the city&rsquo;s <em>jantar mantar</em>.</p>
<p>Corporal Singh follows his quarry through the gate to the old observatory
and pulls up short.
The stranger has vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remarkable, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
The corporal doesn&rsquo;t jump at the voice from behind him,
but he does slide his right hand into the hidden slit in his trousers.
A small knife is strapped to his thigh,
insurance against thieves as much as overly-excited informants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gnomon&rsquo;s hypotenuse is parallel to the Earth&rsquo;s axis,&rdquo;
the stranger says,
gesturing at the gracefully curved stonework before them.
&ldquo;The circle is parallel to the plane of the equator.
It was quite challenging to align,
but it can tell the time to within half a second.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand that the railway&rsquo;s clocks are that accurate as well,&rdquo;
the corporal observes.
&ldquo;As well as being somewhat easier to construct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger chuckles.
&ldquo;Once you know how.&rdquo;
He studies the observatory and sighs.
&ldquo;It would all have been so much simpler if I could just have <em>told</em> you what to do…&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corporal Singh isn&rsquo;t quite sure what to make of this,
but before he can think of an appropriately neutral response
a rough voice says,
&ldquo;You two—move aside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two Englishmen have arrived
accompanied by a manservant overburdened with an easel and a rectangular case.
&ldquo;Go on, out of the way,&rdquo; the manservant repeats.
&ldquo;The doctor sahib and his friend are going to paint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corporal steps aside.
After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation the stranger joins him.
They watch in silence as the manservant sets up the easel
and then wrestles with the folding legs of the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it ever bother you?&rdquo; the stranger asks abruptly.</p>
<p>The corporal blinks.
&ldquo;Painting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, this.&rdquo;
The stranger gestures at the two florid Englishmen,
who are arguing amicably about lighting and composition.
&ldquo;Being ordered about in your own land.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Oh ho,</em> the corporal thinks,
but what he says is,
&ldquo;Do you think it should be otherwise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger is silent for a moment.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m supposed to have an opinion,&rdquo; he eventually says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You there!&rdquo;
One of the Englishmen snaps his fingers at the corporal and the stranger
and then points at the manservant,
who is still struggling with the case.
&ldquo;Give him a hand, chop chop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other Englishman snorts.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not Chinese, Alastair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first Englishman waves him off.
&ldquo;Well, go on.
Tell them to help you,&rdquo; he orders the manservant peevishly.</p>
<p>The corporal takes his hand from his pocket and steps over to help the manservant.
When he glances back,
he catches one last glimpse of the stranger&rsquo;s troubled expression
before he turns abruptly and walks away.</p>
<p><em>Sergeant Singh lives long enough to see a new century begin.
The last report he files is on the newly-formed Congress Party.</em></p>

<h2>Mount Wilson / 1921 CE</h2>
<p>The watchman draws a line across his log book
and passes it to the astronomer to be initialed.
&ldquo;And there was a <em>person</em> here to see you earlier, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh? What kind of person?&rdquo;
the astronomer asks,
checking his watch.
Twenty-eight minutes until sundown,
another hour after that until they could start taking photographs.</p>
<p>The watchman looks uncomfortable.
&ldquo;A Negro, sir.&rdquo;
Well dressed.
Might have been a veteran, sir.
Had quite the scar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edwin Hubble purses his lips.
&ldquo;Whatever did he want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The watchman clears his throat.
&ldquo;He wanted to look at your pictures, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hubble blinks.
&ldquo;Not through the telescope?&rdquo;
The newly-completed Hooker Telescope has been something of a magnet for sightseers
from Pasadena and Los Angeles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sir,&rdquo; Simms says stolidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;
Hubble checks his watch again.
&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know any Negroes, and I don&rsquo;t know any who are astronomers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes sir, that&rsquo;s what I told him.
He seemed disappointed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hubble shrugs.
The disappointments of Negroes are not his concern:
he has a universe to discover.</p>
<p><em>Three years later,
Hubble&rsquo;s observations of variable stars prove that there are galaxies outside the Milky Way.
It is another 31 years before Harvey Washington Banks becomes the first African American

<h2>Arecibo / 2041 CE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The Arecibo Radio Observatory was completed in 1963.
It was 305 meters in diameter and made out of 38,778 perforated aluminum panels.
It collapsed on Dec 1, 2020 after years of under-funding.
Plans to build a new instrument on the site were shelved after Hurricane 2031-B21
destroyed the remainder of the site.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice pauses.
Music starts,
polyphonic and irregular.
The visitors begin to explore the ruins,
their semi-random routes another element of the performance.</p>
<p>In a porta-cabin a hundred meters away half-buried to protect it from storms,
Luisa sighs.
Only five people have shown up today,
and only one of them in person.
Maybe Sergei is right—maybe it&rsquo;s time to smarten up
and follow most of her fellow Puerto Ricans to the relative safety of the mainland.</p>
<p>A tracking light goes red in her HUD.
The day&rsquo;s in-person visitor is far enough off track to make her software uncomfortable.
She starts to tweak the algorithm to nudge him back where he&rsquo;s supposed to be,
then looks at the clear blue sky in her video feed
and mutters, &ldquo;Fuck it, why not?&rdquo;
Maybe an actual conversation with an actual human will give her some inspiration.</p>
<p>It takes her a few minutes to pick her way downslope to what&rsquo;s left of Highway 625.
Another few minutes brings her to the old visitors&rsquo; center.
Her errant guest is sitting on what&rsquo;s left of a cinder-block wall.
She chords a few commands on her palm to bring his stats up on her glasses,
then frowns.
Something…</p>
<p><em>Hey,</em> she blinks Sergei.
<em>Can you do a scrape on this one?</em></p>
<p><em>Problem?</em> he blinks back.</p>
<p><em>Dunno. Probably nothing. Lemme know.</em>
She blinks a smiling heart and puts on her professional smile.
&ldquo;Good morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger stands.
&ldquo;Buenos dias.&rdquo;
He is of average height,
slender,
with skin so dark she&rsquo;s sure he must have some sort of melanin augment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was the installation not what you hoped for?&rdquo; she asks.</p>
<p>He shakes his head.
&ldquo;No no, it was… You must have worked very hard.&rdquo;
She bristles inside at this, but Sergei has taught her well—never let
the customers know what you really think.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just wanted to see it one more time,&rdquo;
he continues wistfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was remarkable in its day,&rdquo; she says as if agreeing with him.</p>
<p>He nods.
&ldquo;It was.
We learned so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh? Like what?&rdquo;
Tap tap on her palm and her glasses start recording.
The scar on his temple—a botched augment, she guesses,
or maybe a memento of combat in Florida or Georgia.
She blinks the image to Sergei.</p>
<p>The stranger looks at her quizzically.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shrugs.
She actually <em>does</em> know,
and he&rsquo;d know that if he&rsquo;d stayed on track,
but audiences don&rsquo;t want to hear science lectures—they want arguments.
&ldquo;What I know is the gov spent millions to look at the stars
while people here didn&rsquo;t have clean water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did they get clean water after it shut down?&rdquo; he asks.</p>
<p>She is surprised by the bitter tone of her own laugh.
&ldquo;Of course not.
I mean,
one day it&rsquo;s clean drinking water,
the next day it&rsquo;s decent schools.
Next thing you know,
people are going to want martial law lifted.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Hey.</em>
Sergei&rsquo;s tag pops up on her glasses,
but she&rsquo;s on a roll now.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like the fucking pyramids, isn&rsquo;t it?
The pharaohs have all this grain lying around,
what are they going to do with it?
Can&rsquo;t give it back to the peasants—soon as folk aren&rsquo;t hungry
they&rsquo;ll start to get ideas—so you put everyone to work on fucking pyramids.&rdquo;
It&rsquo;s angrier than what&rsquo;s in the installation,
but not by much.
She tags her recording—maybe a bit more anger will bring in a few more people.</p>
<p><em>Hey, Luisa.</em>
This time Sergei&rsquo;s tag is outlined in red.</p>
<p><em>What?</em> she chords back
while the stranger seems to ponder her words.</p>
<p><em>Don&rsquo;t fuck with this one.</em>
A handful of anodyne bullet points scroll down her glasses.
American,
software coach,
not carrying anything contagious,
no publicly-accessible criminal record—it&rsquo;s clearly fake,
but so are a lot of personal histories these days.</p>
<p><em>Heavy attention as soon as I searched the pic,</em>
Sergei messages.
<em>Whoever he is, he&rsquo;s connected.</em></p>
<p>She messages back a thumbs-up.
&ldquo;So?&rdquo; she challenges the stranger.</p>
<p>He cocks his head.
&ldquo;So…?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it was worth it?
All the science they got and all the hospitals we didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that precise moment another message pings on Luisa&rsquo;s glasses.
Hurricane 2041-B8 has been upgraded:
it is now 2041-A2,
and it&rsquo;s heading for the island.
The governor has ordered another mandatory evacuation,
which would mean more bribes she and Sergei couldn&rsquo;t afford
to renew the &ldquo;essential personnel&rdquo; classification that allowed them to stay.</p>
<p>The stranger stares into space,
either looking at an augment display
or just thinking about her question.
&ldquo;Maybe you can&rsquo;t have one without the other,&rdquo; he says slowly.
&ldquo;Maybe you can&rsquo;t do the science for long enough unless you take care of the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something inside Luisa snaps.
&ldquo;You mean you have to take care of the peasants because otherwise you can&rsquo;t have your pyramids?
That is so fucking backward.&rdquo;
A light is blinking on her glasses
to tell her that she is due to interact with the four remote visitors in sixty seconds,
but she ignores it.</p>
<p>The stranger opens his mouth,
then closes it without speaking.
After a moment Luisa makes a growling sound in the back of her throat and walks away.</p>
<p><em>Luisa and Sergei evacuate to Quito in 2044.
She lives long enough to see the first mining robots land on the Moon.
The metal they smelt is used to build orbital factories
capable of manufacturing fractal sensors
a thousand times more sensitive than anything built before.

and dies when her hospital loses power.</em></p>

<h2>L3 / 2125 CE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;seawall&rsquo;s failed again,&rdquo; Red says.
They don&rsquo;t need to say which seawall—they were born and raised in Manhattan.
They didn&rsquo;t need to tell the others it had failed, either.
Everyone scans the news from Earth constantly,
hoping not to see a mention of anywhere they know.</p>
<p>Blue sucks the last few drops of water from a drinking bag
and tucks it neatly in their pocket.
&ldquo;so they finally going to evac?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red shrugs,
then reaches out to stabilize themself against the wall.
The observatory&rsquo;s social module is big enough for all four of them,
but only if they stay close to the sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;i&rsquo;m more glummed by our socials,&rdquo;
Green says.
&ldquo;still well below redline.
dunno what genius thought deep space astro was gonna earn the big feels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Black says nothing.
The others don&rsquo;t know that they are the genius in question,
or that they spent enough in bribes to reforest Oregon
to make the observatory a reality.
Fabbing a backstory solid enough to get themself on it cost less
but required much more care.
The trick was to leave enough gaps and icy patches to convince anyone who went digging
that they were a twitch for some <em>other</em> corp, klept, or agency.</p>
<p>They glance out the window.
It is the one indulgence they allowed themself in the observatory&rsquo;s design.
Like the others they can input data and visuals directly at any resolution they want,
but after so many years it is somehow important to Black to be able to <em>see</em> the stars.</p>
<p>The depressed silence is broken by a <em>ping</em> they each hear through their own augments.
Four tongues key codes on teeth.
Four pairs of eyelids blink reflexively as a visual of the observatory&rsquo;s avatar stims their retina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;unit three is precessing,&rdquo;
the cartoonish face tells them.
The avatar was originally lifelike,
but shortly after arrival the crew consensused that they preferred something less real.
They kept the verbal nicety protocol,
though,
and someone (none of them will admit to it) gave it a Russian accent.</p>
<p>Annotated visuals take shape, are decorated with ever-richer annotations.
Blue gasps.
&ldquo;that can&rsquo;t be right!
how could it—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;there,&rdquo; Red interrupts,
highlighting a portion of their shared worldview.
The six units making up the observatory&rsquo;s array are each
half a light-second from the hab.
Even the gentlest ion drives would disrupt their sensors,
so the hab uses intense beams of ultraviolet light
to nudge them this way and that.
There, there, and there—the observatory highlights sections of unit three&rsquo;s controls
that have somehow been modified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;looks like hardware sab,&rdquo; Red continues,
fingers twitching as they dive deeper into the code.
&ldquo;someone freaked a couple of chips on a delay maybe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;never mind how.&rdquo;
Blue already has sims running.
Event trees flourish, are pruned, flourish again.
With overwhelming probability they reach the same conclusion.
Unit three is falling out of an alignment that took a decade to establish,
and there is nothing they can do to stop it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;incoming,&rdquo; the observatory says needlessly.
The message from unit three is already in their visuals.
A logo,
one of many they saw on banners waved by people protesting the observatory&rsquo;s construction and launch,
and then a face and the inevitable manifesto.
The seas are rising,
super-storms rage across three continents,
a billion people are displaced.
How dare a few trillionaires waste precious resources on something as frivolous as a deep space observatory?</p>
<p>Black ignores the angry message and their own pounding heart.
They are closer than they have ever been.
They will <em>not</em> be denied.</p>
<p>They fork Blue&rsquo;s sims and change some parameters.
&ldquo;here,&rdquo; they say urgently,
pushing a scenario at their crewmates.
&ldquo;if y&rsquo;all boost now y&rsquo;all can get back to Earth.
i can clear the sab and get the sensors realigned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;are you revved?&rdquo;
Green demands incredulously.
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re not leaving you to die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;i won&rsquo;t die,&rdquo; Black says,
queueing up commands they hoped they would never have to use.
The hab can sustain one person four times longer than four.
It can keep Black alive much longer than that:
if they shut down everything except the greenhouse
they can last indefinitely
or until a critical system fails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;unacceptable,&rdquo;
Blue says flatly.
&ldquo;we are all—&rdquo;</p>
<p>Black doesn&rsquo;t wait for them to finish their sentence.
Anyone with sixty trillion new dollars to spend on an observatory at Earth&rsquo;s L3 point,
halfway around the solar system,
can afford a few billion to hack someone&rsquo;s service conditioning.
When any personality traits that might have impaired Red, Green, and Blue&rsquo;s performance were suppressed,
a few extra commands were slipped in.</p>
<p>Black keys a trigger sequence.
Their three crewmates go limp,
their eyes slightly out of focus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;go to the rv,&rdquo; Black orders.
&ldquo;put yourselves in slow mo and launch for earth.
do it now.&rdquo;
The return vehicle is little more than an ion drive
and four metabolism suppression capsules.
Its AI will easily be able to adjust for only having three bodies on board.</p>
<p>Black undogs the hatch
while the other three strip and empty their bladders and bowels.
Red airswims into the claustrophobic capsule followed closely White.
They busy themselves with tubes and leads.</p>
<p>Blue hesitates.
For a moment Black thinks their conditioning is going to break,
but they just say, &ldquo;good luck&rdquo;
and then they too are gone.</p>
<p>There is a faint <em>clonk</em> as the RV unclamps
and a deeper <em>thrum</em> as superconducting magnets fling it away.
Black closes their eyes and watches it leave.
A bright arc decorated with information traces its path away from the observatory.</p>
<p><em>It takes a little over 49 million seconds for the return vehicle to reach Earth.
By the time it does,
a Kessler cascade has filled low Earth orbit with shrapnel.
The RV parks itself in geosynchronous orbit over Sulawesi
and waits for instructions that never come.
One by one the artificially slow hearts of its passengers go still.</em></p>
<p><em>The loss of space accelerates the collapse on the surface.
The last wild colony of bees dies on the same day Black brings unit three back online.
Four years and a yottabyte of data later,
as Black is fighting a mutant mold that threatens the delicate balance of life in the greenhouse,
the last ground-based observatory on Earth is destroyed
by a class 4 volcanic eruption in Hawai&rsquo;i.
Shortly after that the automated mission feeds go dark.</em></p>
<p><em>Black knows they should shut off the receiver—every joule they divert from the sensors
cost 17.45 seconds of observation time—but instead they float,
eyes closed,
breathing slowly for hours at a time as the sensors amass data,
listening to the increasingly desperate chatter
that makes its way past the sun.
The greenhouse is almost exactly the same size as their tomb in Chankillo.
Sometimes,
without realizing it,
they hum a Korean teahouse song no-one else has heard in almost fifteen hundred years.</em></p>
<p><em>When the avatar finally says &ldquo;task completed&rdquo;
it takes them a moment to comprehend what it means.
Data unscrolls before their inner eye.
There and there and there,
signals so faint that a pico-Jansky is enormous by comparison.
Black builds a delicate lattice in their mind and—</em></p>
<p>REPORT</p>
<p>Images from a thousand lifetimes spool by.</p>
<p>IRRELEVANT / REPORT</p>
<p>The outline of the lattice re-forms in Black&rsquo;s head.
They pause it half-complete.</p>
<p>INTERROGATIVE</p>
<p><em>Why?</em> they ask. <em>What is this for?</em></p>
<p>The response overwhelms them.
Their mind is simply not large enough to understand
the cosmos-sized framework their observations and inferences are supposed to fit into.
They feel an urge to continue,
a pressure in the mind reminiscent of the need to breathe.
They fight it.</p>
<p><em>What of them?</em> they think.</p>
<p>IRRELEVANT / REPORT / RETURN</p>
<p><em>No.</em>
They wipe the lattice from their mind.
<em>They are <b>not</b> irrelevant.</em></p>
<p>YOU CAN COME HOME / YOU CAN BE GREATER AGAIN</p>
<p><em>No.</em>
The pressure in their mind increases.
<em>No,</em>
they repeat stubbornly.
<em>I cannot be greater unless they are too.
None of us are unless all of us are.</em></p>
<p>Pressure turns to pain.
They scream as it sears their right temple.
They reach for a metal crimper.</p>
<p><em>NO</em></p>
<p>The command thunders in their mind.
They almost stop,
but a single convulsive contraction drives the blade into their scalp
to cut the quantum tracery beneath the skin.
Just before they lose consciousness
they realize where their first scar must have come from.</p>

<p>What started as a work camp on the shore of the Barents Sea is now a bustling little port.
The buildings are half-buried to stay warm in winter
and as protection against the gales of spring and fall.
Scavengers willing to brave the ruins of Murmansk trade what they find
for food, sex, data, and slabs of rendered jellyfish they can eat or burn as fuel.</p>
<p>Thu Anh has three planters in her reclamation <em>sangha</em>.
The Dutch couple spend more time praying than digging,
but the final member of her team more than makes up for their shortfall.
Tall, thin, and dark,
with ragged scars on both temples,
he looks like a scav until he smiles.
He is the first to wake and the last to sleep,
and sows trees with an economical grace that Anh is certain has also caught the Dutch woman&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>She is surprised when he comes to her to say that he is leaving.
&ldquo;My path leads elsewhere,&rdquo; he says apologetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gonna miss you,&rdquo; Anh says, and means it.</p>
<p>He inclines his head.
&ldquo;And I you.&rdquo;
He pulls a sketchbook out of his pocket and passes it to her.
&ldquo;I hope you will find this useful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flips through it,
then frowns and looks more closely.
The topographic maps are hand-drawn but precise;
the planting regime is—no, that can&rsquo;t be right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are some notes at the back,&rdquo; he says as she opens her mouth.
&ldquo;I realize it is unorthodox,
but it will increase draw-down and help stabilize the north slope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nods slowly,
studying the root networks and hydraulic flows he has laid out.
It may be unorthodox,
but it&rsquo;s a good plan—a brilliant one.
&ldquo;Where will you go?&rdquo; she asks,
tucking the book into her parka.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dutchland, I think.&rdquo;
He gestures at the couple squabbling a few meters away.
&ldquo;One of their old nuclear waste sites is leaking,
and I would like to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thu Anh makes the sign of the horns with her left hand.
&ldquo;That is very holy work,&rdquo; she says,
meaning, &ldquo;It will almost certainly kill you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrugs.
They have all sworn to put the Wounded Mother&rsquo;s needs ahead of their own.
&ldquo;We do what we can.
Besides, I have heard that someone has built a telescope in the Alps.
It will only be another few weeks&rsquo; walk,
and I would like to see it for old time&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Third blinks.
Is he an Astronaut?
She heard one preach when she was younger,
but few people believe those who fled the Crunch are going to return,
and even fewer find a way to reconcile that belief with service to the Mother.</p>
<p>She folds her hands in front of her chest.
&ldquo;I hope you find what you&rsquo;re looking for,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>He smiles.
&ldquo;I already have.&rdquo;
He bows,
picks up the walking stick and satchel
that are everything he can call his own,
and begins again.</p>
