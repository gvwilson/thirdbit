<!-- content --><p>TL;DR: We're going to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    split our lesson materials for absolute beginners and people with some previous experience;
  </li>
  <li>
    build some tools to manage those materials;
  </li>
  <li>
    update and clarify the guidelines for instructor training,
    Software Carpentry's scope,
    making contributions,
    and use of our name and logo; and
  </li>
  <li>
    use GitHub issues and blog posts to manage discussion of details
    rather than our mailing list.
  </li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>
  It's been a busy couple of months, but also rewarding:
  we've welcomed two new batches of instructors,
  and more people have submitted lesson material in the last six weeks
  than in the preceding 18 months.
</p>
<p>
  But it's clear we need to simplify and consolidate things:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    A lot of our material is too advanced for many scientists, which
    (a) isn't helpful and
    (b) doesn't fit Mozilla's focus on helping people take their first steps.
  </li>
  <li>
    My choice to break some lessons into small includable pieces
    has proven more confusing than helpful.
  </li>
  <li>
    There's a lot of redundancy in our material.
  </li>
  <li>
    We need a clearer guide for people who want to contribute
    and clearer metadata for the lessons themselves:
    what's covered, what level, prerequisites, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    We need to explain where Software Carpentry stops and other things begin.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  One reason for our current tangle is that
  we're not just teaching computing to scientists:
  we're also creating teaching materials using open source practices,
  which few people do.
  Even programmers who use version control daily don't have many sets of collaborative,
  code-reviewed lessons–certainly not using
  tools as young as the IPython Notebook.
</p>
<p>
  That,
  rapid growth,
  the fact that most of us are scientists first and coders second,
  and the lack of a clear plan have muddled things.
  Here's how we'll clear it up:
</p>
<table class="centered">
  <tr>
    <td>A.</td>
    <td>
      During the week of Nov. 4-9,
      I'll merge the snippets in the <code>_includes</code> directory
      into the <code>lessons</code> directory
      and move image files into more rational places.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>B.</td>
    <td>
      The repo will have a directory for each topic (shell, Git, etc.).
      Each will contain sub-directories called <code>novice</code> (for absolute beginners)
      and <code>intermediate</code> (for people with some previous experience).
      The lessons for each topic will be independent
      because running intermediates through novice material at triple speed doesn't work well.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      C.
    </td>
    <td>
      I'll manage work on novice material for the next three months,
      and Ethan White will coordinate work on intermediate.
      We'll focus on instructor-led rather than self-study material
      (because it's what we need for bootcamps),
      and we'll decide whether to recycle existing material or write new stuff
      on a case-by-case basis.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>D.</td>
    <td>
      Matt Davis will coordinate discussion about what needs to be in each lesson:
      long-form vs. point-form vs. all-in-one,
      manifests and README's,
      etc.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>E.</td>
    <td>
      Aron Ahmadia will coordinate work on tooling for authors and instructors.
      A lot of our material is now in formats that version control doesn't handle well;
      we need to figure out how to manage them,
      how to slim down the starter repo for bootcamps,
      how to integrate lesson material into the main website,
      etc.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F.</td>
    <td>
      We'll use GitHub issues to manage discussion about topics C-E
      so as not to flood our mailing lists.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  Finally, since I'm making lists, we're also going to:
</p>
<table class="centered">
  <tr>
    <td>G.</td>
    <td>
      Change the guidelines for instructor training so that
      participants must have taken part in a bootcamp,
      be planning to host one,
      or have taught coding previously.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>H.</td>
    <td>
      Write an explicit description of Software Carpentry's scope.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I.</td>
    <td>
      Bring Software Carpentry's contribution guidelines into line with
      those of other Mozilla projects.
      (I'll post this and the scope descriptions separately;
      please discuss them there.)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>J.</td>
    <td>
      Clarify the rules on using our name and logo
      so that people must always get explicit permission before doing so.
      (Again, I'll blog, and please discuss in comments.)
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  Our goal is to be ready for the rest of 2014–not least PyCon in April–by mid-January.
  We really want you to join the discussion, write stuff, review stuff, etc.–we have
  great momentum right now,
  and I hope that having a plan for the next couple of months will fuel that.
</p>
<p>
  I look forward to seeing you in our next lab meeting
  at 11:00 am and 7:00 pm Eastern on Nov 14.
