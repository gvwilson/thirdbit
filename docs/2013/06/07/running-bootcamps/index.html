  It's been eighteen months since we started running two-day bootcamps.
  We've grown rapidly:
</p>
<table class="centered">
  <tr>
    <th>Cumulative Number of Bootcamps</th>
    <th>Cumulative Enrolment</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="../../../../files/2013/06/bootcamps.png" alt="Cumulative Number of Bootcamps" class="centered"></td>
    <td><img src="../../../../files/2013/06/enrolment.png" alt="Cumulative Enrolment" class="centered"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  Now we need to start thinking about how to sustain that growth in the long term.
  To start,
  here are some stats on how things have been funded.
</p>
<p>
  First,
  we've experimented with several different ways to fund travel costs,
  and several different ways of charging attendees:
</p>
<table class="centered">
  <tr>
    <th><strong>Funding Model</strong></th>
    <th><strong>Charge Model</strong></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Host</strong>: the host paid costs (typically out of grant money or professional development budget).</li>
        <li><strong>Grant</strong>: travel costs came out of our Sloan Foundation grant.</li>
        <li><strong>None</strong>: there were no travel costs (because local talent was doing the teaching).</li>
        <li><strong>Mixed</strong>: costs were divided between the host site and the Sloan grant.</li>
        <li><strong>Donation</strong>: costs were covered by direct donations.</li>
        <li><strong>Unknown</strong>: we're still waiting for people to tell us how they paid for things.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Free</strong>: learners were not charged.</li>
        <li><strong>Deposit</strong>: learners gave us a refundable deposit (typically US$20).</li>
        <li><strong>Charge</strong>: learners were charged for registration (typically US$20).</li>
        <li><strong>Conference</strong>: a small charge was levied as part of conference registration.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  Here's how often we've used each combination:
</p>
<table class="centered">
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Free</th>
    <th>Deposit</th>
    <th>Charge</th>
    <th>Conference</th>
    <th></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Host</th>
    <td>52%</td>
    <td>1%</td>
    <td>2%</td>
    <td>0%</td>
    <th>55%</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Grant</th>
    <td>18%</td>
    <td>1%</td>
    <td>0%</td>
    <td>1%</td>
    <th>20%</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>None</th>
    <td>17%</td>
    <td>1%</td>
    <td>0%</td>
    <td>0%</td>
    <th>18%</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Mixed</th>
    <td>2%</td>
    <td>1%</td>
    <td>0%</td>
    <td>0%</td>
    <th>3%</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Donation</th>
    <td>0%</td>
    <td>0%</td>
    <td>1%</td>
    <td>0%</td>
    <th>1%</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Unknown</th>
    <td>3%</td>
    <td>0%</td>
    <td>0%</td>
    <td>0%</td>
    <th>3%</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>92%</th>
    <th>4%</th>
    <th>3%</th>
    <th>1%</th>
    <th>100%</th>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  One fact that doesn't show up in this table is that
  the number of grant-funded bootcamps has gone from 16 in 2012
  to 2 in 2013.
  Even if we include two mixed-model bootcamps this year in the latter count,
  we're clearly much closer to bootcamps being self-sustaining.
</p>
<p>
  But being closer isn't the same as being there.
  We're spending about $150K/year in grant money on salaries and overheads
  to keep this whole show going.
  At two bootcamps a week
  (which we think we can reach by this time next year),
  we'd need about $1500 per bootcamp to cover those costs.
  If we stick to an average of 40 learners per bootcamp,
  we'd have to charge a bit less than $40 per person.
  The problem is,
  we often can't do this:
  if we charge for training–even a refundable deposit–then
  some institutions will charge us for use of their space,
  and only charging those who don't have such a rule seems unfair.
  An alternative is to ask for sponsorship on top of instructors' costs,
  rather than tying it directly to enrolment.
</p>
<p>
  Setting that issue aside for a moment,
  though,
  I'm more certain than ever that this training is cost-effective:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    The average attendee is a graduate student who costs about $50,000/year in salary and overheads
    (mostly overheads).
    If she works 40 hours a week, 48 weeks a year, that means her time is worth about $26/hr.
  </li>
  <li>
    Since January 2012, we've run about 75 bootcamps for about 2500 people.
    If each bootcamp is two eight-hour days,
    that works out to $1,040,000 worth of people's time.
  </li>
  <li>
    Instructors' travel costs have averaged about $2000 per bootcamp,
    but we'll round up to $2500 to account for local organizers' time, coffee, etc.
    That gives us another $187,500.
  </li>
  <li>
    The $150K/year burn rate quoted earlier for salaries and overheads
    gives us another $225,000,
    for a total of $1,452,500.
  </li>
  <li>
    But that's only $580 per learner, so at $26/hr,
    we only have to save people about 22 hours each for this to be worthwhile.
  </li>
  <li>
    Looking at it another way,
    if instead we save them an hour a week over five years,
    that's $6240 worth of their time,
    which is 11 times the up-front investment.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Measured that way,
  I'd say we're doing more than OK.
