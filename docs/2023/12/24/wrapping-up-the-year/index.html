<!-- content --><p>With seven days left in the year,
I think it&rsquo;s safe to do a retrospective on
<a href="../../../../2023/01/01/plans-for-the-year/">my goals</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Finish one of the children&rsquo;s books I&rsquo;ve been writing off and on for the last few years:
    nope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sell one short story:
    nope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wrap up the <a href="../../../../sdxpy/">Python version of <em>Software Design by Example</em></a>:
    it has gone off to the printer,
    and should be available by April,
    but I no longer believe in the project.
    The <a href="../../../../sdxjs/">JavaScript version</a> has sold fewer than 300 copies in its first year,
    and most of those were to institutions
    that buy one or two copies of every new book from my publisher.
    I enjoyed <a href="../../../../2023/01/29/would-you-take-this-class/">teaching the Python material online</a>,
    but working through examples as a way of learning software design
    doesn&rsquo;t seem to appeal to as many people as I hoped it would.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help organize another series of lightning talks for <a href="https://neverworkintheory.org/"><em>It Will Never Work in Theory</em></a>:
    yup,
    but we then wound the project down.
    I don&rsquo;t know what it will take to get programmers and researchers to listen to one another,
    but <em>NWIT</em> hasn&rsquo;t worked,
    and any attempt to keep it going right now would be trampled in the AI goldrush.
    We have written a two-page &ldquo;lessons learned&rdquo; on the project
    that we hope will appear in one of the IEEE journals some time next year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refurbish my dad&rsquo;s reclining chair:
    yup.
    I&rsquo;m sitting in it now…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terrace the back half of our back yard:
    nope,
    but we did get some new windows in
    and finished renovations to the kitchen and bathroom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pick up another musical instrument:
    nope.
    Between the tenosynovitis in my right hand and wrist pain in my left,
    the only instrument I could possibly play right now is the trombone,
    and I don&rsquo;t think my family and neighbors would appreciate it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A few other things happened this year that weren&rsquo;t planned:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My daughter got her black belt in karate.
    It has taken ten years,
    and she&rsquo;s had to overcome recurrent back problems,
    but we are very proud of her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My wife and I joined a <a href="https://donate.rainbowrailroad.org/team/515984">Rainbow Railroad</a> team
    that is helping a Ugandan lesbian immigrate to Canada
    in order to escape state-sponsored violence in her own country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I appeared in <a href="https://embedded.fm/episodes/460">Episode 460</a> of the <a href="https://embedded.fm/">Embedded.fm</a> podcast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I made two abortive attempts to restart
    <a href="../../../../2023/12/11/meetings-interruptions-and-power/">a book on software engineering</a>
    that uses topics like &ldquo;how to run a meeting&rdquo; and &ldquo;how to do performance evaluations&rdquo;
    to motivate discussion of professional responsibility,
    (un)fairness at work,
    and other things that most books on the subject ignore.
    Turns out,
    <a href="../../../../2023/12/12/it-ultracrepidarian/">I still don&rsquo;t know enough to write this</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://carpentries.org/">The Carpentries</a> laid off half their staff.
    I have only been peripherally involved with the organization since stepping down in 2017,
    but this still hurt.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So what about 2024?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I want to run <a href="../../../../t3/">the teaching workshop</a> a few more times,
    both to raise money for <a href="https://donate.rainbowrailroad.org/team/515984">Rainbow Railroad</a>
    and because <a href="../../../../2023/10/15/directions/">it makes me feel useful</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to find something to learn that excites me.
    A new musical instrument is out because of my hand;
    I&rsquo;ve thought about reviving my French,
    picking up some Spanish,
    diving into Postgres or machine learning (yeah, yeah, I know, don&rsquo;t hate me),
    but none of them are making my heart race.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terrace the back yard,
    fix the concrete in the front,
    and throw out a third of what&rsquo;s in our basement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally,
    I want to finish one of those children&rsquo;s books and get it published.
    In aid of that,
    I&rsquo;d like to find a writing group in Toronto—I was briefly part of one twenty years ago,
    but it no longer exists
    and the all-comers meetups I&rsquo;ve tried have been pretty scattershot.
    This would partly be a way to keep myself honest about writing,
    but I&rsquo;m also increasingly concerned about becoming socially isolated:
    I talk to fewer people in a normal week than I did before COVID,
    and if I don&rsquo;t make an effort,
    I worry that the trend will continue downward.</p>
