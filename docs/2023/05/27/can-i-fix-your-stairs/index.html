<!-- content --><p>Back in the 90s I knew a woman who lived in a medium-sized town here in Ontario.
Her father had come over from Poland after the war
and built up a small contracting business
while raising three kids.
He was a heavy smoker,
and one day the doctor gave him the news:
there&rsquo;s a shadow on your X-ray,
all we can do now is buy you some time.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks later my friend came home from work
to find her father and his pickup truck gone.
He returned a few hours later,
and when she asked where he&rsquo;d been,
he said,
&ldquo;Just taking care of things.&rdquo;
It happened again, and then again,
and finally she demanded to know where he was going.</p>
<p>Long story short,
Meto was going back to houses he&rsquo;d built—sometimes twenty years ago—and
knocking on the door and saying,
&ldquo;Excuse me, I apologize that I intrude,
but please,
can I fix your stairs?&rdquo;
Some people thought it was a scam and shut the door in his face,
but after forty-odd years he was pretty well known around town,
so yeah,
sometimes people would let him in
to fix a flight of stairs he had never been satisfied with,
or to re-hang a door or straighten a window sash.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many things he got to make right
before he was too weak to go out on his own any more.
I hope it was enough for him to feel that he&rsquo;d done as much as he could.</p>
<p>Time to make another cup of tea.
If you came in peace, be welcome;
if not, be damned with you.</p><!-- /content -->
