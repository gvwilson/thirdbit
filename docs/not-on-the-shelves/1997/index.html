<h1>Not on the Shelves</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">Version 1 / 1997</h2>


<p><a href="../">This page</a> explains why I write reviews of books that don&rsquo;t exist
and has links to other versions of this list.</p>
<p><em><strong>(This article originally appeared in <u>Doctor Dobb&rsquo;s Journal</u>.)</strong></em></p>
<h2><em>Real-World C++</em></h2>

<p>Get a listing of any large program you&rsquo;ve written recently, and
count how much of it is devoted to error handling. If your code is
anything like mine, you&rsquo;ll find that between a tenth and a quarter of
your program is there to handle files that can&rsquo;t be opened, pointers
that are null when they shouldn&rsquo;t be, and so on.</p>
<p>Now, flip through any book on C++, and count how much of it is
devoted to error handling. Other than a few simple examples showing
the syntax of exceptions, you&rsquo;ll probably draw a blank. A similar gap
between what programmers put into programs, and what authors put into
books, shows up in other areas as well, such as how to make user
preferences persistent, how to save and restore objects in files, and
so on. We all know how frustrating it is to have a parser throw out
two hundred error messages because of a single missing semi-colon,
for example, but most compiler textbooks offer little or no advice on
how to recover from parsing errors.</p>
<p><em>Real-World C++</em> is a practical guide to those parts of
real programs that language textbooks leave out. The first three
chapters cover error handling: how to structure programs to deal with
error codes from operating system calls, the design of an exception
class hierarchy, and examples of when and why to throw exceptions.
Chapter four covers error handling in threaded systems, while chapter
five looks at sockets and other network protocols, and chapter six
examines how to deal with parsing errors in both hand-written parsers
and those generated by automatic tools such as yacc. A friend
particularly liked chapter seven, which described a class that
throttles debug messages from particular sections of code using
run-time controls, or compile out the whole, expensive debug mess.</p>
<p>Chapter eight moves away from error handling to examine
persistence. The author introduces the problem by looking at ways of
saving window positions, font sizes, and the like between application
sessions. The examples are all written in terms of the Windows NT
registry, but the ideas could easily be applied to other systems.
Chapter nine then describes a simple object persistence scheme,
similar to the one used in the Microsoft Foundation Classes. This
scheme allows arbitrary sets of objects, connected by pointers, to be
saved to a file, and then restored. The author steps outside C++ in
this chapter to compare her scheme with that used in Java. The last
chapter of the book discusses interface issues: how to report errors
to users, how to log non-fatal errors for later inspection, and so
on.</p>
<h2><em>Case Studies in User Interface Design</em></h2>

<p>Some philosophers distinguish between knowing that, and knowing
how. The former is mostly facts: what is the capital of Samoa, what
is the airspeed of an unladen African swallow, and so on. The latter
primarily consists of techniques, like how to ride a bicycle, or how
to design a user interface. Unfortunately, knowledge of the second
type is hard to put into books, since every general rule has
exceptions, and none of the important ideas can be given exact
definitions.</p>
<p>This book on user interfaces tries to teach the &ldquo;how&rdquo; by working
through fourteen examples. The starting point for each of the first
seven is an existing interface that needs improvement. The authors
describe the interface, analyze its shortcomings, and then show how
to improve it. In the last three of these examples, the authors then
criticize the new interface, and improve on it again.</p>
<p>The examples in the second half of the book start with a blank
canvas. The first two studies begin by describing applications whose
existing interfaces are command-line based; as the authors point out,
interface designers are often required to retro-fit GUIs to existing
programs, so they might as well get used to it early on. In the last
five of the studies, the application itself is up for grabs: given a
vague specification that reads like an email message from someone in
Marketing, the designers are required to figure out both what the
program should do, and how it should appear.</p>
<p>The greatest strength of this book is that it shows how interfaces
are developed, not just what they look like when they&rsquo;re done. Two of
the studies, for example, devote as much space to blind alleys as to
the final, finished interface. By doing this, the authors show how
designers iterate over a design. Ideas such as balance and emphasis
are taught by example, rather than by definition. Throughout, the
authors are careful to draw examples from a variety of systems,
including Windows&lsquo;95, Macintosh, and Nintendo.</p>
<p>The authors are now apparently working on a companion text, whose
working title is <em>The World&rsquo;s Best Interfaces</em>. This book
will analyze and critique some classic interfaces using the ideas,
terms, and analysis techniques built up in <em>Case Studies</em>.</p>
<h2><em>Windows NT for Unix Programmers</em></h2>

<p>We used to make jokes about it: a bunch of guys sitting in a
circle, and one of them stands up and says, &ldquo;Hello, my name is Greg,
and I&rsquo;m a Windows user.&rdquo; We knew Unix was better, and we were
confident that, sooner or later, the rest of the world would come to
its senses and start ls&rsquo;ing and cat&rsquo;ing along with us.</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t quite worked out that way. Like a lot of Unix
programmers, I&rsquo;ve come to realize that Windows isn&rsquo;t going away, and
that NT is actually a pretty good operating system. It has better
support for security and threading than most flavors of Unix, and NT
code doesn&rsquo;t have to be littered with hundreds of fragile,
platform-dependent #ifdef&rsquo;s. As a friend of mine says, at least when
Windows is broken, it&rsquo;s broken the same way everywhere…</p>
<p>The hardest part about making the transition from programming on
Unix to programming on NT was learning the thousand and one things
that Windows programmers take for granted. What exactly is OLE? And
ActiveX? What&rsquo;s the registry for, and how do I use it? How does Excel
work? (Having grown up with Unix, I&rsquo;d never used a spreadsheet.) And,
most importantly, how do I get a simple program up and running using
Visual C++?</p>
<p>This book answers all of those questions, and more. Unlike some
books on Windows, it assumes that its readers are intelligent and
computer-literate. Unlike others; it doesn&rsquo;t assume that its readers
were borned and raised in Windowstan. The three chapters on Visual
C++, for example, don&rsquo;t explain what classes and templates are, but
cover precompiled header files in depth. Similarly, while the whole
of the standard NT interface (mousing, window control, simple editing
commands, the file system browser, and Internet Explorer) is covered
in a single chapter, Excel&mdash;the tool most likely to be foreign to
Unix users&mdash;gets a chapter of its own.</p>
<p>The parts of this book that I will use most are the chapters on
NT&rsquo;s security model, and on system administration, with the chapter
describing OLE and ActiveX running a close second. While I only
skimmed the chapter on Visual Basic, it&rsquo;s nice to know that it&rsquo;s
there if I ever need it. A comprehensive index, with a separate &ldquo;how
to&rdquo; index for quick reference, should earn this book a place on every
recovering Unixaholic&rsquo;s desk.</p>
<h2><em>The Design and Implementation of Interpreted Languages</em></h2>

<p>Whatever else it may be good for, Java is an excellent teaching
language. It runs almost everywhere, is used in industry, is
object-oriented, and checks for a lot of simple errors, including bad
type casts, dangling pointers, and out-of-bounds array indices. By
the end of the decade, I expect Java to be as widely used in
first-year college courses as Pascal was in my youth.</p>
<p>The problem, however, is what to do with students in their second
year. As a sophomore, I took two courses: one on data structures and
algorithms, and one on machine architecture and assembly-language
programming. The first is easy to translate into Java (see the review
immediately following this one), but what about the second? Going
from Pascal to PDP-11 assembler was bad enough; going from an
interpreted, garbage-collected language to today&rsquo;s pipelined RISC
architectures would be impossible.</p>
<p>This book&rsquo;s premise is that C has always really been a high-level
assembly language, and that we should teach it to students in
relation to Java as we taught assembler in relation to Pascal. Over
the course of more than 500 pages (the book is clearly intended for
use in a full-year course), the author shows how to build a simple
interpreter for a subset of Java, called Javette, using C. Everything
important is covered at least once, including pointer arithmetic and
array indexing, allocating and freeing memory, garbage collection,
signed vs. unsigned arithmetic, and machine-dependent data sizes.
Like Kamin&rsquo;s <em>Programming Languages: An Interpreter-Based Approach</em>,
this book builds up its interpreter in stages. Each stage adds
another bit of syntax (such as arrays or inheritance), and then shows
what has to go on under the hood to make it work. Along the way,
students are introduced to the quirks of C, including the use of
preprocessor directives to handle platform-dependent code.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the book, the author stops adding features to
Javette, and starts building support tools. The most important of
these is an execution profiler, which uses both sampling and
instrumentation to collect statistics about program behavior. Results
obtained from profiling are used to segue into a discussion of
caching, virtual memory, and other aspects of machine architecture
that haven&rsquo;t been covered earlier. The final chapter in the book then
presents a simple sockets interface, and introduces the basics of
network programming.</p>
<h2><em>A Second Course in Object-Oriented Programming: Design, Analysis, Data Structures, and Algorithms in Java</em></h2>

<p>Like most professional programmers of my generation, I came to C++
from C, and spent my first year with the language using classes as if
they were structs with constructors, and methods as if they were
functions whose first argument was supplied by the compiler. This was
partly laziness&mdash;I stopped learning C++ as soon as I knew enough to
meet my deadlines&mdash;but I was also encouraged to take this attitude
by the books I&rsquo;d read, which concentrated on the syntax of the
language, and skipped over analysis and design.</p>
<p>The aim of this new book is to teach analysis and design
techniques as if they were as important as language syntax, or basic
data structures. The book is aimed at sophomores who have learned the
basics of Java in a first-year course. It begins by summarizing some
basic data structures and their associated algorithms, and then
presents some design strategies and notations appropriate to them.
Right from the start, the author introduces both the idea of design
patterns, and the Unified Modeling Language (UML) developed jointly by Booch and
Rumbaugh, so that the recapitulation of standard data structures (in
the first half of the book), and the case studies (in the second)
have a uniform look and feel.</p>
<p>All of the examples are based on Web applications, and all of the
implementations are in Java, but the real emphasis of the book is on
how to analyze a problem methodically, and how to design a program,
or set of programs, to meet users&rsquo; needs. While the main text does
not discuss the software development process per se, it does describe
the place of design and analysis activities in the software
lifecycle. The appendices discuss the problem of keeping designs in
step with code as the latter evolves, and how to run a design
meeting. The <em>UML Workbook</em>
discussed below is the second in this series, and focuses more on
the software engineering side of object-oriented programming.</p>
<h2><em>Debuggers: Design and Implementation</em></h2>

<p>There used to be a show on theBBC called <em>Desert Island Discs</em>.
Each week, different guests were asked what ten records they would
take along if they were going to be stranded for the rest of their
life. The equivalent game for programmers would probably be
called <em>Desert Island Development Tools</em>. If you had to pick
three-just three-programming tools to take with you, what would you
take? My list would be (in order) an editor, a compiler, and a
debugger, and I think most other programmers would make the same
choice. I can recompile programs by hand if I have to, and do version
control by making backups, but without a symbolic debugger, my life
would be very, very slow.</p>
<p>Despite their importance, debuggers are ignored by both educators
and authors. In part, this is because there isn&rsquo;t a tidy theory to
teach, as there is with (for example) parsers or databases, but in
part there is also an element of disdain for something that is &ldquo;just
a tool&rdquo;. As this book shows, it might be just a tool, but it&rsquo;s a very
complicated tool to get right.</p>
<p>The author starts with an overview of the software development
lifecycle, and a catalog of well-known debuggers and their features.
After prioritizing the entries in this catalog, she spends three
chapters developing a simple interactive debugger for Javette, the
Java subset introduced in <em>The Design and Implementation of
Interpreted Languages</em> (reviewed earlier in this article). As she
explains at the start of these chapters, it is much easier to write a
debugger for a language that is executed by software, rather than
directly by hardware, so most of the key ideas in debuggers are
introduced in this forgiving environment. The debugger itself is
written in a mix of Java and C.</p>
<p>The next five chapters of the book cover the same ground, but this
time the debugging target is real machine code. While the Pentium
processor is used for all working examples, the author discusses
other common microprocessor architectures, including the Alpha, MIPS,
SPARC, and PowerPC, in sidebars. The topics covered include setting
breakpoints and watchpoints, displaying the contents of memory,
tracing execution history by walking through a stack, and so on.
Again, sidebars are used to compare debugging Javette with debugging
other languages, such as C++, in which less information survives to
runtime. The author&rsquo;s emphasis is always on &ldquo;what&rdquo; and &ldquo;how&rdquo;, but
there is some good discussion of user interface issues as well. The
author also discusses ways of dealing with such things as
out-of-order instruction execution, dynamically-loaded libraries, and
functions with multiple entry and exit points.</p>
<p>The book&rsquo;s three appendices discuss how to debug multi-threaded
code, how to debug remote applications, and (interestingly) how to
test and debug a debugger. Taken as a whole, the book resembles
Tanenbaum&rsquo;s <em>Operating Systems: Design and Implementation</em>
(a.k.a. the Minix book) in its practical emphasis.</p>
<h2><em>The Elements of Software Engineering Style</em></h2>

<p>This book&rsquo;s subtitle, &ldquo;A Software Development Process for Small
Teams&rdquo;, is almost as much review as it needs. Most books on software
engineering are written as if the only important projects were those
that required hundreds of programmers, and at least five years of
uninterrupted work. Even the best of the exceptions,
McConnell&rsquo;s <em>Rapid Development</em>, is a survey of practices that
a small group of programmers could adopt, rather than a description of
a complete, coherent development process.</p>
<p>This book fills the gap by describing how a small group of
programmers (up to a dozen, according to the introduction, including
both one technical writer and two testers) should tackle a project
that will take from six months to two years to complete. After
describing a few of the standard software lifecycle models, the first
chapter outlines the &ldquo;Small Team Process&rdquo; described in the rest of
the book. Each chapter then covers a single aspect of the process,
including gathering requirements, architectural design, setting
coding standards, code reviews, scheduling and progress reviews,
testing, source code control, bug tracking, documentation, and
preparing for release.</p>
<p>One of the book&rsquo;s strengths is its brevity. It has the same
dimensions as a paperback novel, and individual chapters are very
short: the longest is 22 pages, and the shortest (on coding
standards) is only five, half of which is devoted to a humorous
discussion of why so many programmers have wasted so much energy on
religious wars over indentation.</p>
<p>The book is full of small tables and checklists, all of which are
available for downloading via the Web. The authors clearly expect
that readers will be using Windows as their development platform (the
Gantt charts in the section on scheduling, for example, still have a
Windows&lsquo;95 frame around them), but the ideas themselves are
platform-independent. I was particularly impressed by the discussion
of how to integrate bug reports from both internal testing and
external users with source code control, and with the author&rsquo;s &ldquo;What
Can Go Wrong?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Have You Remembered?&rdquo; lists.</p>
<h2><em>How to Write Better Computer Games Faster</em></h2>

<p>Most teenagers who teach themselves how to program do so because
they want to write computer games. As the authors of this book point
out in their introduction, however, anyone who learns how to program
from the examples in games magazines will probably also learn a lot
of bad habits, which they may or may not be able to shake off later
in life. Since few teenagers are interested in anything that&rsquo;s good
for them, this book tries to teach good programming practice by
disguising it as games programming. &ldquo;Get Your Games Running Faster!!&rdquo;
the cover proclaims (complete with a double exclamation mark). &ldquo;Spend
Less Time Debugging, and More Time Playing!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The material in the book is much the same as you would find in
McConnell&rsquo;s <em>Code Complete</em>, or Maguire&rsquo;s <em>Writing Solid Code</em>.
However, the presentation is aimed directly at fifteen-year-olds with
&ldquo;Nintendo Million-Point Champion&rdquo; tattoos.  Almost all of the examples
involve graphics, and many show how sloppy style leads to either buggy
code, or code that runs too slowly to be playable. The &ldquo;before and
after&rdquo; style, with changes to the code carefully explained and
highlighted, means that you can read the examples out of order. I
particularly enjoyed the chapter, &ldquo;50 Ways a Bomb Can Bomb&rdquo;, which
finds 50 separate errors and inefficiencies in a small class
representing a nuclear bomb.</p>
<p>The two last chapters in the book are devoted to handling joystick
input. The tight constraints of real-time programming, and the
near-impossibility of debugging device handlers with the kinds of
tools available to amateurs, give the authors a chance to drive their
&ldquo;get it right the first time&rdquo; message home. C++ and Windows&lsquo;95 are
used throughout the book, although the authors are careful to stick
to the simpler features of both. Thankfully, though, the authors
steer clear of examples involving sound cards…</p>
<h2><em>Software Tools for Scientists and Engineers</em></h2>

<p>Most scientists and engineers write programs when they should use
packages, do by hand what could be done automatically, and make
little use of advanced algorithms and data structures. One of the
reasons for this is the rate at which computing technology is
evolving. In 1980, when I started programming, I could get by knowing
only a few editor commands and a couple of Fortran compiler options.
Today, the editor I use is larger than most of the operating systems
of that era, and my compiler has over a hundred different switches to
control optimization alone. Mastering these more complex tools
clearly takes more time, but that time is not available in most
undergraduate curricula. As important as computing skills may seem,
learning them is less important to a scientist or engineer than
learning about her own discipline.</p>
<p>The aim of this book is to make modern software engineering
practice accessible to numerical scientists. In the introduction, the
author lays out three principles on which the book is built:</p>
<ol>
   <li>Concentrate on the concrete, not the abstract.</li>
   <li>Be conservative-describe only things that have proved themselves and are unlikely to change.</li>
   <li>Focus on those platforms that scientists and engineers are most likely to use.</li>
</ol>

<p>The result covers much the same material as
<em>The Elements of Software Engineering Style</em> (reviewed above),
but at greater length, with much more description and motivation, and
with very different examples.  Where <em>ESES</em> is written in terms
of tools that computer scientists use (such as C++), <em>STSE</em>
uses MATLAB 5.0 (a popular numerical scripting language) and
FORTRAN-77. There is no discussion of object-oriented programming, but
a full chapter on numerical precision, and another on how to test
numerical programs in the face of round-off errors. As a running
example, the authors build up a simple regression-testing framework
called strafe, which (by the time it is completed) consists of an HTML
interface and a few simple scripts to re-run tests, collate their
results, and generate reports in which differences from previous runs
are highlighted.</p>
<h2><em>Large-Scale Visual Basic Software Design</em></h2>

<p>The idea is simple, and at least twenty years old: programmers
should use objects as if they were integrated circuits, and build
programs by combining such &ldquo;software ICs&rdquo; with bits and pieces of
glue logic. Despite the claims made by vendors of object-oriented
systems, however, few programmers work this way. A typical C++
programmer might use <TT>stdlib</TT> or the Microsoft Foundation
Classes extensively, but in the same &ldquo;call &lsquo;em when you need &lsquo;em&rdquo; way
as her predecessor in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Visual Basic&mdash;lowly, sneered-at Basic&mdash;is the only
industrially-significant language whose users have really embraced
component-based programming. There is an enormous market for Visual
Basic controls, and many large applications are written by combining
these, rather than re-writing them. If history had been only slightly
different, Visual Basic could have turned into the <em>lingua
franca</em> of computing that Java is now poised to become.</p>
<p>However, Visual Basic does have some significant shortcomings. As
the author of this book points out, the most important of these is
that Visual Basic encourages a fragmented programming style: it can
be almost impossible to reverse engineer the control flow of a mature
VB application. The solution she advocates is to avoid getting into
trouble in the first place. Over the course of 400 pages, she
describes and illustrates programming practices intended to
accomplish exactly that. Like Lakos&rsquo;
<em>Large-Scale C++ Software Design</em>, the aim is not to teach the language,
but to show how to organize a large, complicated source base so that
many programmers can work together productively over a period of
months or years.</p>
<p>The author has no illusions about what it will take to get people
to adopt the practices she advocates. &ldquo;If you are reading this book,&rdquo;
she says in the introduction, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably because you&rsquo;ve just
watched a big project grind to an unproductive halt.&rdquo; While this book
might not stop that happening to everyone once, at least there&rsquo;s no
longer an excuse for it to happen a second time.</p>
<h2><em>Software Tools for the World-Wide Web</em></h2>

<p><em>Software Tools</em> was one of the most influential books
in the history of computing, as it introduced a whole generation of
programmers to the Unix philosophy of tool-based computing. In
retrospect, one of the reasons the Unix tools were so successful was
that they all worked with a single, universal data format, namely
strings of ASCII text, terminated by newline characters. One of the
reasons that tool-based computing hasn&rsquo;t taken root in other
environments (such as Microsoft Windows) is that no such format
exists. The internal structure of a Microsoft Word <TT>.doc</TT>
file, for example, bears little resemblance to that of an Excel
spreadsheet.</p>
<p>The author of this book begins by arguing that in fact a new
universal data format does exist: HTML. Unlike newline-terminated
ASCII, however, HTML has a nested structure, which is difficult for
the streaming model of Unix to handle. In the first ten chapters of
this book, the author therefore develops a suite of tree
transformation utilities, which can be used to parse, re-arrange, and
output HTML. These utilities are more sophisticated than the
<TT>cat</TT>, <TT>grep</TT>, and <TT>sed</TT> of the original
<em>Software Tools</em>, but, as their starting point is also
more sophisticated (a Java class library that contains regular
expressions and other parsing tools), the overall cognitive burden is
about the same. Where the original <em>Software Tools</em>
concentrated on parsing and text formatting, this book concentrates
on page layout and data mining, i.e. on the things that make the
World-Wide Web more than just &ldquo;FTP with pictures&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The final two chapters of this book take the tools built in the
previous ten, and construct a simple dataflow GUI for combining them.
With a few mouse clicks, users can create pipelines (or even task
farms, for those lucky enough to have multiprocessors) of HTML
filters, then set the controls of each. With another mouse click, the
resulting multi-filter can be turned into a standalone Java
applet&mdash;the 1990s equivalent of simple C-shell script.</p>
<h2><em>The Future of the Java Programming Language</em></h2>

<p>Few things in computing have become as popular, as quickly, as
Java. While a decade passed between the introduction of C++ as its
widespread adoption as the standard systems programming language,
Java became a fact of life for thousands of programmers in a matter
of months. One of the reasons for this success is that Java is a very
conservative language. Its syntax is immediately familiar to anyone
who has ever use C, its type system combines those of C++ and
Smalltalk without moving beyond either, and its concurrency
primitives are a formalization of the kinds of object-oriented
wrappers that programmers have been using to encapsulate low-level
thread packages for years.</p>
<p>The contributors to this collection all clearly believe that Java
would be a better language if it incorporated features that have
proved useful in other languages. Each chapter is the work of a
different author. Those in the first half of the book focus on one
extension that their authors particularly want. These range from
anonymous functions (similar to those created by the &ldquo;lambda&rdquo; operator
found in Lisp dialects), to distributed shared memory (on which there
are two chapters), true multi-dimensional arrays (like C, Java
provides only nested vectors), and strongly-typed templates.  This
last proposal owes a great deal to the work of Bank, Liskov, and Myers
at MIT; its authors acknowledge that runtime casting allows generic
containers to be built in Java, but argue persuasively that this is
bad both from a software engineering standpoint, and because it makes
compile-time optimization more difficult.</p>
<p>The chapters in the second half of the book discuss class libraries
and support tools. Among the former is a descriptin of a matrix class
library that relies on Veldhuizen&rsquo;s expression templates to generate
just-in-time execution kernels. Among the latter is a description of
the Class Hierarchy Evolution Animator. This uses version control
information, such as that stored by <TT>rcs</TT> or SourceSafe, to
animate a class hierarchy diagram using Booch and Rumbaugh&rsquo;s Unified
Modeling Language (UML). New classes sprout from old ones as other
classes fission like bacteria or grow fat with additional
methods. While this may not have a lot to do with Java, it&rsquo;s a great
toy.</p>
<h2><em>Object-Oriented Systems Programming</em></h2>

<p>By the end of the 1980s, C had become the language of choice for
systems programming on both Unix and Windows machines. In fact, C had
become so successful that, as far as most programmers were concerned,
both operating systems were more-or-less defined by their C
interfaces.</p>
<p>Since then, however, most C compilers have evolved into C++
compilers, and books that once used C for their examples, such as
graphics and database textbooks, have switched to C++ as well. The
only major holdouts are operating systems and networking books, which
(according to the introduction in this book) have been held back by
the lack of standard C++ bindings for Unix and Windows. As a result,
almost everyone who uses C++ winds up defining classes to represent
files, directories, sockets, threads, and so on, even for &ldquo;new&rdquo; (i.e.
post-C++) operating systems such as Windows NT.</p>
<p>The aim of this book is accordingly to bring systems programming
into the 1990s. In the course of more than 500 pages, the authors
develop a C++ class library whose elements model everything from file
system entries and network connections to user accounts and
performance monitoring information. Some of this work is not
new&mdash;the networking classes, for example, are based on Schmidt&rsquo;s
ACE toolkit&mdash;but the parts are integrated cleanly. What is more
important, the authors develop their class library in stages,
examining alternative design possibilities and implementation
strategies as they go along. They also borrow some ideas from
<em>Real-World C++</em> (reviewed earlier), and show how to use
conditional compilation flags and proxy classes to manage the
differences between their two target platforms (Solaris and Windows
NT). The Web sites referenced at the end of each chapter contain
implementations for other operating systems, including Linux and AIX
(but not Windows&lsquo;95 or MacOS). The result is a book that could, if
supplemented by material on the theory of the subjects, be used as a
text in a full-year course on operating systems and networking.</p>
<h2><em>Intellectual Property Made Simple</em></h2>

<p>The legal aspects of the software business were complicated enough
when the major problem was people using software without paying for
it. The advent of the World-Wide Web has squared and cubed the
problem. If you use a GIF image as a button in your home page, for
example, and I download it for use in my page without asking your
permission, am I breaking the law? What if you copied that button
from someone whose page explicitly said that it wasn&rsquo;t in the public
domain, but you didn&rsquo;t include a note to that effect? And what if I
then printed out my page, GIF and all? Would that be illegal? In
Ontario, the answers are (currently) &ldquo;no&rdquo;, &ldquo;no&rdquo;, and &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, but other
jurisdictions might not even officially recognize that there are
issues to address.</p>
<p><em>Intellectual Property Made Simple</em> presents this
problem, and several like it, in its first chapter. The next three
chapters then trace the historical development of property law from
land, through patents and copyrights, to the invention of
photocopying. As the authors say at the start of chapter five,
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s when hell quietly broke loose.&rdquo; Using example after example,
the authors show how cheap reproduction, particularly digital
reproduction, is reshaping the intellectual underpinnings of
capitalism. Look and feel, free software, and litigation as
intimidation are all discussed, and some folklore is put to rest (no,
IBM doesn&rsquo;t employ more lawyers than engineers).</p>
<p><em>IPMS</em> is aimed squarely at programmers, particularly
programmers working in start-ups. There is practical advice on how to
patent software, and how much protection that patent actually gives
its holder. One section discusses what rights students have to the
software they produce during their studies; another, who owns things
that were produced by companies that no longer exist, and another,
the furore that surrounds encryption in the United States. Where they
can, the authors concentrate on principles rather than particular
statutes, as the latter are so often either non-existent or changing
rapidly. This not only makes the book more readable, it also ensures
that it won&rsquo;t quickly be outdated.</p>
<h2><em>Computational Layout: An Object-Oriented Approach</em></h2>

<p>My second non-trivial C program, back in 1982, read text from a
file and set it in left- and right-justified paragraphs. I&rsquo;ve been
tripping over layout problems ever since: VLSI circuits, geometric
objects in 3-dimensional landscapes, dependency graphs, floor plans,
and many more. What I haven&rsquo;t been tripping over, until now, is a
programmer&rsquo;s introduction to placing things in space.</p>
<p><em>Computational Layout</em> is exactly that book. The author
starts with the same problem I first encountered, that of justifying
text using a fixed-width font (although they do it in the context of a
web browser, rather than a compiler like <tt>troff</tt> or
<tt>TeX</tt>). Having used this example to introduce some terms and
algorithms, the author starts Chapter 2 by asking, &ldquo;What if space was
elastic?&rdquo; She then spends almost 200 pages looking at the implications
of stretchability, touching on things such as hyphenation, pagination,
and widowing (the &ldquo;dangling line&rdquo; problem). By the time she is done,
she has described a framework in which classes capture layout
information, and class instances figure out where they should position
their contents by evaluating themselves.</p>
<p>The second half of the book shows how this framework (or, more
accurately, the ideas behind the framework) can be applied to other
problems, such as labeling maps and laying out circle-and-arrow graphs
so that lines are short, straight, and cross one another infrequently.
While this is all useful in its own right, the book&rsquo;s real strength is
the way in which it shows how to build an object-oriented framework for
a particular problem domain.</p>
<h2><em>From Key to Screen: How Computers Really Work</em></h2>

<p>The introduction to this book says it best:</p>
<blockquote>About two years ago, my daughter asked me how it was that she
could press a key on our computer, and make a picture from Australia
appear on the screen. I said I didn't know, but maybe we could find
out together. Today, two years later, I know a lot more than I thought
I ever would about packet switching, name servers, Unicode, JPEG, and
a hundred other things.</blockquote>

<p>The book&rsquo;s target audience is 14-year-olds who are interested in
science and technology, but I suspect it will also be read by adults
who dislike the wearying jokiness of books with titles like &ldquo;XYZ for
Cretins&rdquo;. What kind of signal is sent to a computer when a key is
pressed? How does the computer know which program to give the
character to? How does that program decide what to do with the
character? How does it turn characters into names, and names into
locations on the World-Wide Web? How does it ask other computers for
pictures and HTML pages? How does it display them?  These questions,
and many more, are all answered in 200 pages&rsquo; worth of simple line
drawings and simple, but not simplistic, prose. A lot of other, less
concrete, things are also explained: hierarchy and modularity,
abstract machines, the difference between a program and an
algorithm… The book closes with a URL for a site where the author&rsquo;s
answers to readers&rsquo; questions (and his daughter&rsquo;s as well) are
regularly posted.</p>
<h2><em>The UML Workbook</em></h2>

<p>This book, a follow-on to
<em>A Second Course in Object-Oriented Programming</em> (reviewed earlier),
is a software engineering book with a difference.  Like McConnell&rsquo;s
<em>Rapid Development</em>, it focuses on small-team programming: half-a-dozen
people, working for a year or so, on a single product.  However, instead of
surveying different working practices, or even trying to teach those practices explicitly,
this book presents over two dozen partially-worked case studies.  Readers are
given extracts from reports, folders of email messages, hand-drawn sketches,
and even a few audio clips, then asked to construct use case diagrams and other
models using
the Unified Modeling Language (UML).
They can then compare their answers with those given on the CD that comes with this
book (which usually has two or three different answers for each problem).  Several
of the examples&mdash;an on-line auction system, an automated teller machine, and a
computational geometry toolkit&mdash;recur several times, so that readers can see how
various models should be layered on top of one another.  While this book is probably
not suitable by itself for a one-term course on software engineering, it would be
an excellent adjunct to McConnell, or to Fowler and Scott&rsquo;s <em>UML Distilled</em>.</p>
<h2><em>Software Tools: A Survey of Best Practice</em></h2>

<p>Most programmers only ever master a single programming environment,
such as Emacs and GNU on Unix, or Borland C++ on Microsoft Windows.
As a result, most programmers have no context within which to
evaluate their tools.  How does your present debugger stack up against
others, for example?  The odds are that you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know, that is, until you&rsquo;ve read this book.  In 11 chapters
and 3 appendices, its contributors present a horizontal look
at programming environment components, rather than a vertical
look at a particular programming environment.  Thus, instead
of &ldquo;Programming with GNU&rdquo; or &ldquo;Visual C++ Made Less Excruciating&rdquo;,
the book has chapters describing how each of the following
work, what the state of common use is (i.e. where&rsquo;s the floor),
and what the state of the art is (i.e. where&rsquo;s the ceiling):</p>
<ul>
<li>source code repository</li>
<li>modeling tool (Rational Rose being the best-known of the 5 tools surveyed)</li>
<li>scripting language (Visual Basic for Applications and Emacs Lisp are both treated rather harshly here)</li>
<li>compiler (focusing on error reporting and incremental compilation)</li>
<li>editor/source browser</li>
<li>debugger</li>
<li>GUI construction and prototyping toolkit</li>
<li>delivery and installation packaging (InstallShield is probably the best-known example in this chapter)</li>
<li>performance profiling tools</li>
<li>testing, with separate sections on automation and tracking</li>
<li>bug reporting and tracking</li>
</ul>

<p>The book doesn&rsquo;t cover everything, of course: project management software,
while just as important to most programmers&rsquo; day-to-day activities, is barely
mentioned. While I expect much of what&rsquo;s in this book to become stale as new
versions of the tools mentioned are produced, that&rsquo;s partly the point&mdash;as
the authors say, having someone point out publically where its offerings fall
short is a big incentive for a tool vendor to fix things.</p>
<h2><em>C++ As If C Never Happened</em></h2>

<blockquote>
As C++ compilers approach the ANSI standard, C++ class libraries that
exploit the complexity of the standard to give both expressiveness and
efficiency are coming on line…  while the library writer must
basically use every obscure subclause in the standard, most of this
complexity can be hidden from the library user.
<br>
&ndash; <i>Scott Haney</i>
</blockquote>

<p>After sending a lengthy proof of a geometric theorem to a
colleague, Blaise Pascal wrote, &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d had more time, I would have
written a shorter letter.&rdquo;  Sadly, programming language
standardization committees seldom feel the same way: almost without
exception, the length of the final standard is proportional to the
amount of time spent deliberating.  Add this to the reluctance of most
committees to ever actually discard features (deprecation doesn&rsquo;t
count), and life eventually becomes hell for both compiler writers and
students.</p>
<p>This book goes a long way toward making C++ less hellish for
newcomers.  Pointer arithmetic, &ldquo;naked&rdquo; arrays, and other low-level
features inherited from C are not mentioned until the third appendix.
While references show up in chapter 1, along with <tt>vector</tt>,
<tt>string</tt>, and other standard library classes, pointers don&rsquo;t
appear until chapter 5, and it isn&rsquo;t until chapter 7 that students are
shown how to write a class from scratch, instead of deriving from the
reference-counted base class <tt>CRoot</tt>.</p>
<p>Purists and power users will probably not like this book, and will
probably express their indignation by saying that it describes C++ as
if it were Java.  However, that&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing: having
seen how to get things done safely and quickly in C++, students will
be better placed to learn how to handle the language&rsquo;s more dangerous
features.</p>
