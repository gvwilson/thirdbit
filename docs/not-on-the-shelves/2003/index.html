<h1>Not on the Shelves</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">Version 2 / 2003</h2>


<p><a href="../">This page</a> explains why I write reviews of books that don&rsquo;t exist
and has links to other versions of this list.</p>
<p><em><strong>(This article originally appeared in <u>Doctor Dobb&rsquo;s Journal</u>.)</strong></em></p>
<p>When I first started doing book reviews for <em>Doctor Dobb&rsquo;s
Journal</em> in 1997, I wrote an article called &ldquo;Not on the Shelves&rdquo;.
In it, I described eighteen books I&rsquo;d like to review that no-one
seemed to have written.  The world and I have both moved on since
then; this article presents my current thoughts on the subject.</p>
<p>One important difference between then and now is the growing
proportion of faculty with industrial experience.  During the dot-com
boom, many bright minds left academic departments to start companies.
(At one point, the drop-out rate among Ph.D. students at Stanford was
close to 80%.)  Many are now drifting back to universities, either
because their startup failed, or because they made some money, and can
now afford to pursue their own interests.  These people are more
focused on building real systems than baby boomer colleagues who were
hired in the 1970s or early 1980s, and they are going to want to
change the curriculum to reflect this.</p>
<h2><em>Introduction to Software Development</em></h2>

<p>This book is aimed at undergraduate majors in Computer Science who
have completed at least one year of Java programming. Its aim is to
teach them what they need to know in order to develop software on spec
and on time in a small team. The style is &ldquo;eat your own cooking&rdquo;.  For
example, the first chapter covers version control, and in subsequent
chapters, students do exercises by checking code out of a repository,
working on it, and then submitting it for grading by checking it back
in. Similarly, the chapter on testing introduces JUnit, a unit testing
framework developed by the Extreme Programming community. Many
subsequent examples then include a few unit tests, and a few of the
exercises at the end of each chapter require students to write tests.</p>
<p>Two features of this book are particularly noteworthy. The first is
the way in which it shows students how the theory can be put into
practice. The chapter on build systems, for example, discusses basic
graph algorithms as part of explaining how tools like Make work.  It
then uses the implementation of a simple Make-like tool as a setting
for further discussion of finite state machines (for parsing) and
design patterns.</p>
<p>The second noteworthy feature is the book&rsquo;s use of Stanley, the
groupware tool which is the running example in <em>Multi-Tier
Architectures: Theory and Practice</em> (reviewed below). Students
using that book in a third-year course will therefore already be
familiar with what Stanley does, understand the practices it is meant
to support, and know how some of its components are built.</p>
<h2><em>Introduction to Computer Architecture and Systems Programming</em></h2>

<p>As a sophomore, I took two courses: one on data structures and
algorithms, and one on machine architecture and assembly-language
programming. The first is easy to translate into Java (see the review
immediately following this one), but what about the second? Going from
Pascal to PDP-11 assembler was bad enough; going from an interpreted,
garbage-collected language to today&rsquo;s pipelined RISC architectures
would be impossible.</p>
<p>This book solves the problem by treating C as a high-level assembly
language, and using it to introduce students to low-level issues such
as pointer arithmetic, memory allocation, machine-dependent data
sizes, signed versus unsigned values, and string handling. Its running
example is the implementation of a subset of the Java Virtual Machine
(JVM). Like Kamin&rsquo;s <em>Programming Languages: An Interpreter-Based
Approach</em>, this book builds up its JVM in stages.  Each stage
adds another feature (such as function calls), and then shows what has
to go on under the hood to make it work. Along the way, students are
introduced to the quirks of C, including the use of preprocessor
directives to handle platform-dependent code.</p>
<p>By the middle of the book, the author has stopped adding features to
the JVM, and started building support tools. The most important of
these is an execution profiler, which uses sampling and
instrumentation to collect statistics about program behavior. Results
from it are used to segue into a discussion of caching, virtual
memory, and other aspects of machine architecture that haven&rsquo;t been
covered earlier. The author also covers error handling on both Unix
and Windows, a topic which most other textbooks gloss over, but which
makes up 30-40% of the code in real applications.</p>
<h2><em>Multi-Tier Architectures: Theory and Practice</em></h2>

<p>Most large computer systems these days are multi-tiered: cell
phones and web browsers talk to web servers, which in turn talk to
application servers backed up by LDAP directories and SQL databases.
This book gives students and end-to-end view of these components, and
their interactions.  It starts off with two chapters on networking:
what sockets and ports are, how name lookup works, and so on.  Chapter
3 then implements a simple web server in Java, which Chapter 4 extends
with multithreading.  Chapter 5 then extends the server further to
turn it into a simple Java servlet container modeled after the Apache
Foundation&rsquo;s Tomcat.</p>
<p>The second half of the book switches from building a toy servlet
engine to using a real one.  Over the course of three chapters, it
introduces students to Apache&rsquo;s Struts application framework.  The
exposition steers clear of the framework&rsquo;s more arcane details;
instead, the emphasis is on analyzing it in terms of design patterns,
and on using it to motivate discussion of reflection, dynamic class
loading, performance issues, and other aspects of real systems.  The
chapter on caching, for example, analyzes half a dozen different
algorithms from a theoretical point of view, and then compares that
with the performance of actual implementations.</p>
<p>The running example in the book&rsquo;s second half is Stanley, a simple
groupware tool modeled after SourceForge.  Like SourceForge, Stanley
lets users create and manage software projects.  It combines web
interfaces to version control, unit testing, batch builds, mailing
lists, and so on, and its implementation is a good vehicle for
introducing students to the tools, libraries, and protocols on which
these tools are built.  (Students who have used <em>Introduction to
Software Development</em> in an earlier course will already be
familiar with Stanley.)</p>
<h2><em>Design and Implementation of Virtual Machines</em></h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to get a degree in computer science without doing a
course on compilers, but it&rsquo;s almost impossible to find a course on
virtual machines.  This book sets out to correct that by showing
students how the &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; part of languages like Java, C#, and Python
is built.  It analyzes and compares the runtime engines for three
popular languages: Java&rsquo;s JVM, Python&rsquo;s PVM, and .NET&rsquo;s CLI.  The
first is used as a baseline, since most students will already be
familiar with it (particularly if they have already taken a course
using <em>Introduction to Computer Architecture and Systems
Programming</em>).</p>
<p>The PVM is used to show students how freely-typed interpreters are
build; the authors could have used Scheme, Smalltalk, or Perl here,
but as they say in their discussion, the first two are fading, while
the third is far too tangled.  Their discussion of Microsoft&rsquo;s CLI
then gives them an opportunity to delve into just-in-time compilation,
component systems, and generic programming.  Here and elsewhere, they
return to three topics over and over again: how to make it right, how
to make it fast, and how to make it safe.  Most students will probably
find the two chapters on security issues fascinating, as the authors
describe what buffer overrun attacks are, and how the JVM&rsquo;s class
loader verifies byte codes.  The book closes with a chapter each on
how debuggers work, and on the C and C++ runtimes.</p>
<h2><em>Quality Assurance: Theory and Practice</em></h2>

<p>Lots of books have been written about software testing and quality
assurance (QA), but few have sold well.  This is partly due to
snobberyâ€”most programmers see testing as a low-status
occupationâ€”but the books themselves must share some of the blame.
Take Dustin&rsquo;s recent <em>Effective Software Testing</em> as an
example: it&rsquo;s impossible to argue with her &ldquo;50 Specific Ways to
Improve Your Testing&rdquo; (to quote the book&rsquo;s subtitle), but the book
doesn&rsquo;t actually show me examples of how to go about testing, or give
me tools that I can use to do it.</p>
<p>In contrast, <em>Quality Assurance: Theory and Practice</em>
describes both the testing process, and a suite of Open Source tools
that developers can download and use.  After one brief chapter on
terminology (which thankfully only spends one page on horror stories
of what can go wrong when software fails), the author moves straight
into examples of unit testing.  Chapter 3 then analyzes the patterns
uncovered in Chapter 2, and uses those patterns to motivate the design
of JUnit.  Chapter 4 presents a catalog of common programming
mistakes, along with JUnit tests that can catch them.</p>
<p>In the second part of the book, Chapter 5 looks at integrating testing
into the build cycle using Ant and Dartboard.  Chapter 6 then looks at
testing multithreaded programs, while Chapter 7 moves on to
distributed applications, and tools like the Apache Foundation&rsquo;s
Cactus.  Performance issues are covered in Chapter 8, while Chapters
9, 10, and 11 return to the software lifecycle by looking at
bug-tracking systems, requirements analysis, and test plans.  Testing
for security holes gets a chapter of its own (Chapter 12), as do
internationalization (Chapter 13) and usability (Chapter 14).</p>
<p>There are two reasons why this book will probably succeed where others
have failed.  The first is that its blend of &ldquo;what&rdquo; and &ldquo;how&rdquo; means
that readers can immediately see how to implement the ideas that are
being presented to them.  The second, equally important, is that by
showing programmers tools, the author is signalling that testing is a
programming activity, and not something to be looked down on.</p>
<h2><em>Modern Operating Systems</em></h2>

<p>When Andrew Tanenbaum&rsquo;s <em>Operating Systems: Design and
Implementation</em> appeared in the mid-1980s, a typical PC had an
Intel 80286 processor with one small cache, 640 KByte of RAM, and a 10
MByte hard drive.  Many of today&rsquo;s desktop machines have caches larger
than those hard drives, and the complexity of operating systems has
grown to the same degree.  It is simply no longer possible for anyone,
particular a student, to understand an entire desktop operating system
from top to bottom.</p>
<p>Luckily for education, a host of simpler computing devices, and
operating systems, are now available.  Cell phones, PDAs, and
children&rsquo;s game consoles all have their own OS&rsquo;s, and those are the
focus of this book.  The topics are the same as in most other books on
operating systems: bootstrapping, concurrency, resource management,
and so on.  However, when the authors of &ldquo;Modern Operating Systems&rdquo;
discuss Unix and Windows, they do so in the same terms that authors of
earlier books used when talking about OS 360.  The real action, they
feel, is in small, interactive devices.  Accordingly, they devote less
space than most books to file systems, and more to networking and
graphical displays.  Palm OS, Symbian, and QNX are used as examples,
and students are (strongly) encouraged to download the authors&rsquo; own
SLOS (Stupid Little Operating System), which runs native on
Palm-compatible hardware, and in an emulator on Windows and Linux.</p>
<h2><em>Case Studies in User Interface Design</em></h2>

<p>Some philosophers distinguish between knowing that, and knowing
how. The former is mostly facts: what is the capital of Samoa, what is
the airspeed of an unladen African swallow, and so on. The latter
primarily consists of techniques, like how to ride a bicycle, or how
to design a user interface. Unfortunately, knowledge of the second
type is hard to put into books, since every general rule has
exceptions, and none of the important ideas can be given exact
definitions.</p>
<p>This book on user interfaces tries to teach the &ldquo;how&rdquo; by working
through fourteen examples. The starting point for each of the first
seven is an existing interface that needs improvement. The authors
describe the interface, analyze its shortcomings, and then show how to
improve it. In the last three of these examples, the authors then
criticize the new interface, and improve on it again.</p>
<p>The examples in the second half of the book start with a blank
canvas. The first two studies begin by describing applications whose
existing interfaces are command-line based; as the authors point out,
interface designers are often required to retro-fit GUIs to existing
programs, so they might as well get used to it early on. In the last
five of the studies, the application itself is up for grabs: given a
vague specification that reads like an email message from someone in
marketing, the designers are required to figure out both what the
program should do, and how it should appear.</p>
<p>The greatest strength of this book is that it shows how interfaces are
developed, not just what they look like when they&rsquo;re done. Two of the
studies, for example, devote as much space to blind alleys as to the
final, finished interface. By doing this, the authors show how
designers iterate over a design. Ideas such as balance and emphasis
are taught by example, rather than by definition. Throughout, the
authors are careful to draw examples from a variety of real systems,
and to show variations appropriate to desktop clients, web browsers,
and hand-held devices.</p>
<h2><em>Computing and the Law</em></h2>

<p>The legal aspects of the software business were complicated enough
when the major problem was people using software without paying for
it. The advent of the World-Wide Web has squared and cubed the
problem. If you use a GIF image as a button in your home page, for
example, and I download it for use in my page without asking your
permission, am I breaking the law? What if you copied that button from
someone whose page explicitly said that it wasn&rsquo;t in the public
domain, but you didn&rsquo;t include a note to that effect? And what if I
then printed out my page, GIF and all? Would that be illegal? In
Ontario, the answers are (currently) &ldquo;no&rdquo;, &ldquo;no&rdquo;, and &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, but other
jurisdictions might not even officially recognize that there are
issues to address.</p>
<p><em>Computing and the Law</em> presents this problem, and several
like it, in its first chapter. The next three chapters then trace the
historical development of property law from land, through patents and
copyrights, to the invention of photocopying. As the authors say at
the start of chapter five, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s when quiet hell broke loose.&rdquo;  The
authors show how cheap reproduction, particularly digital
reproduction, is reshaping the intellectual underpinnings of
capitalism. Look and feel, free software, and litigation as
intimidation are all discussed, along with privacy rights and
jurisdictional issues.</p>
<p>This book is aimed squarely at programmers with no prior exposure to
legal terminology.  New terms are clearly explained, and then put into
context.  One section discusses what rights students have to the
software they produce during their studies; another, who owns things
that were produced by companies that no longer exist, and another, the
furore that surrounds encryption in the United States. Where they can,
the authors concentrate on principles rather than particular statutes,
as the latter are so often either non-existent or changing rapidly.
This not only makes the book more readable, it also ensures that it
won&rsquo;t quickly be outdated.</p>
<h2><em>Software Development for Scientists and Engineers</em></h2>

<p>This book covers much of the same ground as <em>Introduction to
Software Development</em> (reviewed earlier), but with less depth and
more breadth.  Its audience is seniors, graduate students, or
professionals whose background is science or engineering, rather than
programming.  Readers are assumed to know what loops, conditionals,
and function calls are, but nothing beyond that is taken for
granted.</p>
<p>The book starts off by introducing version control.  It then
introduces Python, a popular Open Source scripting language.  The
authors&rsquo; aim is not to sell Python to readers, but rather to have a
simple language in which to present regular expressions, file system
operations, job control, processing XML and binary data, and so on.
Lots of &ldquo;how&rdquo; is mixed in with the &ldquo;what&rdquo;: the chapter on writing
classes in Python is followed by one on unit testing, while the
chapter on processing XML is followed by one on design patterns.</p>
<p>It would be impossible to cover all the material in this book in a
single semester, but the later chapters are well suited to
self-study.  Advanced topics range from graphics through integrating
with legacy C and Fortran to the software lifecycle.  Taken as a
whole, the book gives scientists and engineers a useful toolkit, and a
sense of where to go next.</p>
