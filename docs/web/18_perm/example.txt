ahmed view: SELECT "person",COUNT("capability") "allowed" FROM "permission" WHERE "person"='ahmed' AND "capability"='view'
[('ahmed', 1)]
zephyr view: SELECT "person",COUNT("capability") "allowed" FROM "permission" WHERE "person"='zephyr' AND "capability"='view'
[(None, 0)]

1. query with unused CTE tries to get 'label' from 'perm'
WITH perm AS (SELECT "person",COUNT("capability") "allowed" FROM "permission" WHERE "person"='ahmed' AND "capability"='view') SELECT "label" FROM perm

2. query starting with samples but not joining
WITH perm AS (SELECT "person",COUNT("capability") "allowed" FROM "permission" WHERE "person"='ahmed' AND "capability"='view') SELECT "label" FROM "samples"

3. select from both tables without explicit join tries to get everything from samples
WITH perm AS (SELECT "person",COUNT("capability") "allowed" FROM "permission" WHERE "person"='ahmed' AND "capability"='view') SELECT "label","person","allowed" FROM "samples"

4. attempt to join without .on raises exception 'Joiner' object has no attribute 'select'

5. attempt to join with True raises exception 'bool' object has no attribute 'fields_'

6. attempt to join with True raises exception 'bool' object has no attribute 'fields_'

7a. joining with 'label == label' for ahmed
WITH perm AS (SELECT "person",COUNT("capability") "allowed" FROM "permission" WHERE "person"='ahmed' AND "capability"='view') SELECT "samples"."label","perm"."person","perm"."allowed" FROM perm JOIN "samples" ON "samples"."label"="samples"."label"
[('first', 'ahmed', 1), ('second', 'ahmed', 1)]

7b. joining with 'label == label' for zephyr
WITH perm AS (SELECT "person",COUNT("capability") "allowed" FROM "permission" WHERE "person"='zephyr' AND "capability"='view') SELECT "samples"."label","perm"."person","perm"."allowed" FROM perm JOIN "samples" ON "samples"."label"="samples"."label"
[('first', None, 0), ('second', None, 0)]
