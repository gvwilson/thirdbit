      This map shows the birthplaces of the 146 students I supervised
      from 2002 to 2010.  I would welcome a chance to help a few more,
      so if you are a student or independent learner interested in
      doing any of the projects described below, or an instructor
      whose students need projects,
      please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">get in touch</a>.
      And if you are in Toronto and your team needs help with research
      software engineering projects (large or small), I would also be
      happy to chat.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a mentor, I interact with students through email, chat, and
      code reviews as I would with junior colleagues, and meet with
      them once a week in person or online. Timezones are not an
      issue, but unfortunately English is the only (human) language
      I'm comfortable working in. Finally, all software must be open
      source, all publications must be open access, and projects must
      have a <a href="../conduct/">code of conduct</a>.

        <h3>Browsercast</h3>
<p>
  Tools like PowerPoint aren't web-friendly.  When you export a
  slideshow to the web, what you get is a bunch of images, while
  screencasts are opaque to search engines and disability aids.  In
  contrast, <a href="https://github.com/gvwilson/browsercast">Browsercast</a>
  plays snippets of audio in the browser as the viewer moves through
  the slides, so "View Source", links, CSS, screen readers, and search
  work as they should.  The prototype uses just 5kb of JavaScript; the
  aim of this project is to turn it into a functional tool.

  <a href="https://marimo.io/">Marimo</a> is a next-generation

  relies on <a href="https://anywidget.dev/">AnyWidget</a>, which
  specifies a simple contract between extensions and Marimo's
  rendering and execution engine.  The aim of this project is to
  design, build, and test a set of Marimo plugins that can be used for

  library like <a href="https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/">BeautifulSoup</a>,
  perform whatever operations it needs to, and then convert the DOM
  back to HTML. In this project, students will refactor
  Python-Markdown so that it can generate a Beautiful Soup-compatible

  One type of exercise that H5P <em>doesn't</em> support is adding

  those labels to the side, and then lets the user try to drag them
  back into the right places.  A deployable version would need to do a
  lot more, such as dealing with scaling transformations; the goal of
  this project is to turn the demo into something a classroom teacher
  could use.

  of the science and a walk-through of the untested code, then explore

  cells. <a href="https://dagster.io/">Dagster</a> and
  <a href="https://metaflow.org/">Metaflow</a> are computational
  workflow tools that allow users to add decorators to functions and

  handful of times, they should learn to see code through the
  instructor’s eyes. Does this help them write better code? If so, how
  quickly and how well?  This project will attempt to answer these

  Does test-driven development actually make programmers more
  productive?  And do people actually believe these claims?  This
  project will conduct a quantitative survey of best-selling books on
  software developmnt to measure how many of their claims are backed
  by citations, and of those, how many are considered valid, then
  survey programmers to see which (if any) they believe.

        <h3>Understanding Ethics</h3>
<p>
  This project will start by creating a set of scenarios in which a
  programmer needs to make an ethical decision, each with
  multiple-choice options.  An expert will determine the best answer
  for each; students and professionals will then be asked to answer
  the same questions, and the results will be analyzed to see how well
  each group matches the experts' opinions and whether practitioners'
  opinions are any better than those of students.

        <h3>What "Business of Software" Doesn't Teach</h3>
<p>
  Many universities offer an undergraduate course on entrepreneurship
  or the business of software. This project will survey these courses
  to determine what they <em>don't</em> teach. For example, how many
  of these courses (if any) devote time to labor rights? How many
  discuss anti-trust legislation? And how does that variy by country
  and by the nature of the institution?

        <h3>Comparing Slideshow Tools</h3>
<p>
  Are slideshows written using HTML- or Markdown-based tools more
  text-intensive than those written in PowerPoint?  Putting it another
  way, are slides written in formats that version control understands
  (text) less likely to use diagrams than slides written with GUI
  tools? To answer this question, the student(s) doing this project
  will have to develop ways to quantify how graphical or textful a
  presentation is, and learn how to make work of this kind
  reproducible.

        <h3>Tooling Effort over Time</h3>
<p>
  How does the percentage of effort devoted to tooling and deployment
  change as a project grows and/or ages?  And how has it changed as
  we've moved from desktop applications to cloud-based applications?
  Once a project reaches a certain size, does the amount of tooling
  (measured by number of files or lines of configuration) level off?
  Does the effort required to maintain the tooling grow as the code
  base grows, or does it level off as well? Answering these questions
  will give the student(s) a chance to learn how to mine software
  repositories.

  are supported by their tools?  Which ones do they use informally
  without explicit tool support, and how do they operationalize them?
  These questions cannot be answered by mining software repositories;
  instead, the student(s) doing this project will have to administer
  surveys and conduct observational studies.
