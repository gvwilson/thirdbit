<!-- content --><p>As I was coming out of the library today, I saw a guy in a white van scrape against a car parked on a side street while trying to make a tight corner. The guy in the van didn&rsquo;t stop, but a passer-by went into the library, wrote down the van&rsquo;s license plate number and his own phone number, and taped it to the car that had been scraped.  That got me thinking about the word &ldquo;community&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s bandied around a fair bit in our field (as in, &ldquo;open source community&rdquo;); here&rsquo;s what I think it actually means.
At least week&rsquo;s code sprint, we decided to replace the navigation bar on the left side of DrProject with pull-down menus.  It looks more modern, it&rsquo;ll keep the print view in sync with the web view, and did I mention that it looks more modern? We decided to use <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a>, in part because it has better accessibility support than its major competitor, <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">Scriptaculous</a>. Jeff Balogh spent two and a half days ramping up and prototyping; he continued with the conversion after flying back to Florida for school.</p>
<p>At quarter after three on Friday afternoon, David Wolever came into my office and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not happy.&rdquo; He&rsquo;d been playing with Jeff&rsquo;s new interface, and while it was very shiny, it was also very slow: up to four seconds per page load with the browser on the same box as the server. (No, this wasn&rsquo;t the wiki parser bug resurfacing…)</p>
<p>I sent mail to Alex Russell and Kevin Dangoor at 3:25 pm.  At 5:09 pm, Alex sent an 800-word reply that began:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Looking at the drproject SVN, I can see some pretty straightforward opportunities to optimize.
</code></pre></div>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right: he had checked out our source code and read through enough to realize that we weren&rsquo;t using
<code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags to load the Javascript, that we hadn&rsquo;t made a layer for the widgets we were requiring, and that we hadn&rsquo;t taken advantage of the Dojo build system&rsquo;s ability to roll up just the widgets we needed into one bundle to reduce the number of requests.</p>
<p>Kevin replied a few hours later as well, but by that time Jeff was able to post the following timings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only dojo.js: 35 requests, 1 sec</li>
<li>dojo.js + dijit.js: 17 requests, 0.62 sec</li>
<li>dojo.js + dijit-all.js: 35 requests, 1.3 sec</li>
<li>dojo.js + drproject.js: 4 requests, 0.35 sec</li>
</ul>
<p>Not bad at all.  No idea how long it would have taken to get there without help, but I&rsquo;m very, very glad that we didn&rsquo;t have to find out—that there was a community out there of people who believed that helping us with no immediate prospect of reward was just the right thing to do.</p>
<p>So thanks, guys—the next beer&rsquo;s on us.</p><!-- /content -->
