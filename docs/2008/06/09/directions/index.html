<!-- content --><p>I find myself less interested in reviewing technical books than I was a couple of years ago, and I think I have figured out why.  I used to write a lot of code: for my job, for books I was working on, for open source projects, and occasionally for non-profits or friends.  I enjoyed it, and was always looking for new ideas or technologies that would make my life easier and my apps sparkle.</p>
<p>But that was then, and this is now.  Now, I write grant applications and curmudgeonly articles, not code.  My only involvement with the stuff I used to care so much about is steering student projects, and even that is getting harder to pull off—I&rsquo;ve fallen so far out of touch with today&rsquo;s technologies (and the details of the projects I am supposed to be supervising) that I embarrass myself through ignorance with ever-increasing frequency.</p>
<p>I tried for a while to change my reading material to match the change in my role.  Project management, software development processes, software architecture—I&rsquo;ve read and reviewed a fair few books in these areas since 2005, but none of them have really stirred my soul.  That&rsquo;s partly because &ldquo;soft&rdquo; topics are much harder to teach in print than technology, but also because deep down, my heart&rsquo;s not in it.  I don&rsquo;t <em>want</em> to be one of those slightly-out-of-touch managers I sneered at when I had one eyebrow dyed red and saw <em>Stop Making Sense</em> a dozen times in three months.  I want to build things, dammit: elegant, useful things that do their job so well nobody really notices they&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>So what should I do?  Find a job where I can get my hands into code again?  Resign myself to sitting on the beach and watching the young punks surf the waves I used to ride?  The first would be difficult: I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d add enough value to justify the salary I need to feed my mortgage without taking more time away from family than I&rsquo;m willing to.  But the second rankles.  Cabinet makers and goldsmiths and other skilled artisans don&rsquo;t have to give up their craft as they get older; why should I?</p>
<p>In thirty-five minutes, I&rsquo;ll deliver my &ldquo;HPC Considered Harmful&rdquo; talk to HPCS&lsquo;08 in Quebec City.  This time tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll be back at my desk in Toronto, revising yet another grant application, and wishing that I really, truly understood DrProject&rsquo;s internals.  In between I&rsquo;ll spend some time with my wife, and feed my daughter breakfast.  It&rsquo;s a good life, really—I have so much more than I ever expected to.  But some time in the next few days I&rsquo;m going to look at the books on my shelf and wish I was knee deep in something that would give me a reason to read one line by line and cover to cover.</p>
