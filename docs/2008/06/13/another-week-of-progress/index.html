<!-- content --><p>Our students all seem to be making progress:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kosta Zabashta has posted a (rather quiet) screencast showing the current state of IRC integration. Your comments on the user interface would be very welcome.</li>
  <li>Eva Wong has been wrestling with <a href="http://iwa-wong.livejournal.com/2382.html">security and domains in Flex</a>. Input would be welcome—surely it can't be this hard? Meanwhile, Matthew Basset managed to <a href="http://mbasset.wordpress.com/2008/06/13/steady-as-she-goes/">burn 100% of his CPU</a> on logging, but is making good progress regardless.</li>
  <li>Nick Jamil has posted a summary of <a href="http://nickjamil.livejournal.com/9932.html">what he's learned and done so far</a>.</li>
  <li>Victoria Mui has discovered <a href="http://idea021.wordpress.com/2008/06/13/document-me/">how useful writing documentation can be</a> when you're trying to learn your way around legacy code.</li>
  <li>Eran Henig's Python plugin for Web-CAT is <a href="http://summerwebcat.wordpress.com/2008/06/13/blooming-time/">ready for testing</a>. The security features aren't there yet, but round-trip submission and execution of exercises seems to work. He and the other Web-CAT students had a chance to talk on Friday with my former boss, <a href="http://www.nevex.com/">Gene Amdur</a>—apparently, they got to hear stories about me (some of which might have been true).</li>
  <li>Xuan Le took time off this week to <a href="http://os161viz.blogspot.com/2008/06/week-5-is-it.html">learn her way around mips.c</a>, one of the core elements of the os161 simulator.</li>
  <li>Daniel Servos has figured out <a href="http://hackerdan.com/programing/making-scite-play-nice-with-moodles-coding-guide-lines/">how to make SciTE play nicely with Moodle's coding standards</a>. More importantly, he has a demo version of <a href="http://compsci.ca/~dan/moodle/">a text UI for visualizing Moodle stats</a>.  (Log in as guest, then go to <a href="http://compsci.ca/~dan/moodle/grade/report/stats/index.php?id=2">http://compsci.ca/~dan/moodle/grade/report/stats/index.php?id=2</a> to see the stats display.)  He'd be grateful for feedback—see <a href="http://hackerdan.com/programing/cvs-demo-and-a-bug/">here</a> for more info.</li>
  <li>Ming and Bing gave their second demo, then were <a href="http://pipe3f.wordpress.com/2008/06/15/blasted-back-to-the-stone-ages/">hit with a hard drive crash</a>. They're going to do some paper prototyping this week to see if their proposed interface works in the hands of other people.</li>
  <li>Joseph Yeung is getting ready to <a href="http://openafsmmc.wordpress.com/2008/06/16/crashes/">pull his hair out</a>.</li>
  <li>Dmitri Vassilenko has taken Robert Frost's advice, and is <a href="http://slashid.wordpress.com/2008/06/17/the-final-stretch/">back on the HTTP POST highway</a>.</li>
  <li>Matthew Basset now <a href="http://mbasset.wordpress.com/2008/06/16/it-lives/">crudely supports stuff</a>.</li>
  <li>Jeff Balogh has posted a demo of his <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/2008/06/17/whats-going-dnd-form-editor-land">Dojo drag-and-drop form editor</a>. Feedback welcome.</li>
  <li>And over at Undamped, Charlotte has <a href="http://undamped.blogspot.com/2008/06/optimization.html">learned the value of version control</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone has been discovering that coding isn&rsquo;t the real challenge—getting other people&rsquo;s software built, installed, configured, and playing nicely is much harder. Everyone also had a good time at lunch on Thursday June 5th—I&rsquo;m grateful to Professors <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kyros/">Kyros Kutulakos</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hector/">Hector Levesque</a> for coming to represent the department, and to the following friends from industry for coming along to talk about life outside academia:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Roy Pereira, Colin Smillie, and Pierre Lafayette from <a href="http://refreshpartners.com">Refresh Partners</a></li>
  <li>Ben Newton from <a href="http://www.rogers.com">Rogers</a></li>
  <li>Drew Atkins and Jeremy Chan from the <a href="http://www.jonahgroup.com">Jonah Group</a></li>
  <li>Rob Tyrie and Adam Edmonds from <a href="http://www.nexjsystems.com">NexJ Systems</a></li>
  <li>John Salama from <a href="http://www.kneebone.com">Kneebone</a></li>
  <li>Shawn Konopinsky from <a href="http://www.infusion.com">Infusion</a></li>
  <li>Shidan Gouran from <a href="http://www.jazinga.com">Jazinga</a></li>
  <li>Sumit Oberai from <a href="http://www.indigo.ca">Indigo</a></li>
</ul>
<p>My apologies if you were there and I forgot to mention you—I was too busy fending off grad students who were trying to scavenge before our guests were done eating to take proper notes. We&rsquo;ll be having another lunch on either June 30 or July 2; if you&rsquo;d like to come along and meet some rising stars, please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">drop me a line</a>.</p><!-- /content -->
