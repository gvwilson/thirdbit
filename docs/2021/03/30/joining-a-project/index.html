<!-- content --><p>A few days ago I asked people how to get up to speed when joining a new software
project or starting a new job.  I&rsquo;ve condensed the answers I received below; I&rsquo;d
be grateful for improvements and corrections.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<dl>
<dt>Search first.</dt>
<dd>Whatever question you have, the odds are pretty good that someone has asked it
before, or has opened an issue about it or discussed it in the project chat.
It should only take a minute to find out if the project is well organized,
and if you mention what you searched for when you do ask a question, people
will probably point you in the right direction when they answer.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>
<dl>
<dt>But do ask.</dt>
<dd>The biggest mistake I&rsquo;ve seen newcomers to a project make is to spend hours
or days looking for something rather than asking a question.  If you have
searched and haven&rsquo;t found anything useful, it&rsquo;s OK to take a minute of
someone else&rsquo;s time, particularly if you post your question where they can
deal with it in their own time.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>
<dl>
<dt>Remember that software is only one part of a project.</dt>
<dd>There are many ways to contribute to a software project.  Updating or
translating documentation and testing bug fixes are good places to start;
they will also help you learn your way around and make you friends.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>
<dl>
<dt>Respect what has already been done.</dt>
<dd>If the first thing you do when you walk into someone&rsquo;s home is say, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
how I&rsquo;d redecorate,&rdquo; you shouldn&rsquo;t expect to be invited back.  When you
first join a project, Follow its coding conventions even if you prefer
something else.  Use existing tags for issues, and above all, don&rsquo;t
introduce yourself by suggesting that they rearchitect the code or change
languages.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>
<dl>
<dt>Be patient.</dt>
<dd>It took me almost three months of full-time work to get up to speed in my
previous job, and the first contributor to the Python scripts used to build
this book needed a couple of evenings to find their way around.  Depending
on the size, age, and organization of the project you&rsquo;re joining, you should
expect it to have to invest something like this much time before you feel
productive.  (You will always look back and say, &ldquo;I could have done this so
much more quickly.&rdquo;  You will always be wrong.)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>
<dl>
<dt>Start small.</dt>
<dd>This is a corollary of the previous three points.  As you learn your way
around a project, socially as well as technologically, you will build a
mental model of how it works.  Offering a small contribution is a way to
test that mental model.  Do you really understand the application&rsquo;s
architecture?  Do you know where tests are supposed to go and how review and
merging work?  A three-line change to documentation is a more cost-effective
way to test this than three hundred lines of new code that might completely
miss the mark.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>
<dl>
<dt>Keep exploring.</dt>
<dd>Thousands of books have been written about how to <em>write</em> code, but only a
few about how to <em>read</em> it (<a
href="https://isbndb.com/book/9780672333705">Spinellis2003</a> being my
favorite).  However, reading other people&rsquo;s code is one of the best ways to
learn how to be a better programmer, while browsing a project&rsquo;s issues can
give you even more insight into why the code works the way it does (and
where and why it stops working).  If you feel that this is a less productive
use of your time than coding, think about how much time musicians spend
listening to each other or how much artists look at each other&rsquo;s work.
<br>
In my experience, the best approach to learning your way around a new code
base is to trace what happens during typical operation.  What functions or
methods are called in what order as an HTTP request is processed?  What
objects are created and (perhaps most importantly) what permanent changes
are made to files or databases, if any?  The &ldquo;step over&rdquo; button your
debugger is a very useful tool for this, since it allows you ignore
low-level details while you&rsquo;re trying to paint a bigger picture.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>
<dl>
<dt>Get to know people.</dt>
<dd>There is a softball team here in Toronto that practices every Thursday from
May to October, but hasn&rsquo;t played an actual game in twenty years.  As with
many groups, their ostensible reason for existing is really just an excuse
for people who like each other to hang out.  A lot of software projects are
like that, in industry as well as open source: participants get satisfaction
from working with one another as well as from what they produce.  While your
job and your software won&rsquo;t ever love you back <a
href="https://isbndb.com/book/9781787384644">Jaffe2021</a>, the friendships
you make with people you work beside may outlast both.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>
<dl>
<dt>Remember that most relationships don&rsquo;t end in marriage.</dt>
<dd>It&rsquo;s OK to do a little work on an open source project and then decide it&rsquo;s
not for you.  It&rsquo;s equally OK to look for a new job if you&rsquo;re not happy with
the one you&rsquo;re in: after all, most companies wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to eliminate
your job if they needed to cut costs.  Don&rsquo;t let anyone manipulate you by
making you feel guilty about this.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>
<dl>
<dt>Share what you learn.</dt>
<dd>If you aren&rsquo;t the first person to join a project, you probably won&rsquo;t be the 
last.  One of the most compassionate things you can do is share what you
found out as you were getting up to speed so that the next person can climb
the hill more quickly.  Doing this also helps you figure out what you know
now that you didn&rsquo;t know then, which can help you the next time around.</dd>
