<!-- content --><p>A month ago I <a href="../../../../2021/11/23/not-what-i-set-out-to-do/">wrote</a> about
<a href="../../../../sdxjs/"><em>Software Design by Example using JavaScript</em></a>
and how it fell short of what I&rsquo;d hoped to create.
Part of the problem is that from a teaching point of view,
JavaScript is still crippled by design decisions made in haste in its early days.
Python is an obvious alternative,
and I hope a Python version of the book will exist some day,
but Python is no longer a small language:
I&rsquo;m now twelve weeks into my first full-time programming job in over a decade,
and I&rsquo;m a little dumbfounded by how much Python now looks and feels like Enterprise Java.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to say,
&ldquo;Just ignore decorators and async I/O and the <code>:=</code> operator in class,&rdquo;
but that&rsquo;s disingenuous.
Newcomers will bump into these things as soon as they search online for help,
because they actually are helpful for people who are programming in the large;
that&rsquo;s just not my use case.</p>
<p>So what about teaching with something that&rsquo;s still small?
<a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> is the right size, and well documented,
but I&rsquo;m unwilling to invest in a language
<a href="http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2008-06/msg00407.html">whose development is not open</a>.
<a href="https://wren.io/">Wren</a> is about the right size,
but its syntax will be a bit offputting for my target audience;
its derivative <a href="https://dictu-lang.com/">Dictu</a> will be more approachable,
and it has the beginnings of a decent standard library.</p>
<p>But life is short, and always getting shorter.
I&rsquo;ve invested about 50 hours so far working through the second half of
Nystrom&rsquo;s excellent <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/"><em>Crafting Interpreters</em></a>
and enhancing the source of Lox (the little language it builds)
to include array and table primitives and a few other features.
Based on that,
and on a comparison of the size of Dictu&rsquo;s source code with
a need-to-have list based on <a href="../../../../sdxjs/"><em>SDXJS</em></a>,
I estimate it would take about 200 hours to turn Dictu into
what I&rsquo;d want to take a second run at a book on software tools
(which itself would only take about another 200 hours,
since I&rsquo;ve already done most of the required thinking).
400 hours is pretty much all of my hobby time for 2022,
and there are other things I want to do more,
so reluctantly—very reluctantly—I&rsquo;m probably going to have to shelve this one.</p>
<p>Which is a shame,
because (a) I&rsquo;ve been enjoying writing low-level code again,
(b) I&rsquo;ve been learning stuff, which I always enjoy,
and (c) despite <a href="../../../../2020/07/09/acm-sigsoft-award/">a long string of failures</a>,
I think the final product would help a lot of people.
If I still had access to a pool of senior undergraduates in need of thesis projects
I might reach a different answer;
as it is,
I think this I should mothball the repository and turn my attention elsewhere.</p>
