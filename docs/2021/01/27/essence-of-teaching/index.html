<!-- content --><p>David Rozenshtein&rsquo;s <em><a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/essence-of-sql-a-guide-to-learning-the-most-sql-in-the-least-amount-of-time/oclc/1024095343">The Essence of SQL</a></em>
is still one of the best little tutorials I&rsquo;ve ever read.
It&rsquo;s been out of print for years,
but if you&rsquo;re writing lessons on technical topics,
I think it&rsquo;s still worth getting, studying, and emulating.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../files/2021/essence-of-sql.jpg" alt="Essence of SQL cover" class="centered"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a small book:
paperback-sized and only 119 pages long.
Rozenshtein spends the first three of those pages explaining what tables, rows, and columns are
and how to issue a query,
then presents the thirteen questions the book is going to answer:</p>
<ol start="1">
  <li>What are the student numbers of the students who take CS112?</li>
  <li>What are the student numbers and names of the students who take CS112?</li>
  <li>Who takes CS112 <em>or</em> CS114?</li>
  <li>Who takes <em>both</em> CS112 <em>and</em> CS114?</li>
  <li>Who does <em>not</em> take CS112?</li>
  <li>Who takes a course which <em>is not</em> CS112?</li>
  <li>Who takes <em>at least</em> 2 different courses?</li>
  <li>Who takes <em>at most</em> 2 different courses?</li>
  <li>WHo takes <em>exactly</em> 2 different courses?</li>
  <li>Who takes <em>only</em> CS112?</li>
  <li>Who takes <em>either</em> CS112 <em>or</em> CS114? (Note the differnce from #3.)</li>
  <li>Who are the <em>youngest</em> students?</li>
  <li>Who takes <em>every</em> course?</li>
</ol>

<p>It takes him 60 pages and lots of little examples to answer those questions.
Along the way he introduces selection,
filtering,
Boolean operations,
the &ldquo;select and subtract&rdquo; approach to negation,
and a bunch of other ever-more-complicated ideas.
With those in the bag he goes on to:</p>
<ol start="14">
  <li>
    For each department that has more than 3 professors older than 50,
    what is the average age of the professors?
  </li>
  <li>What is the grade point average of each student?</li>
  <li>What is the overall average salary of all professors who are older than 50?</li>
  <li>Which professors' salaries are greater than the overall average?</li>
  <li>Whose salary is greater than the average salary within that professor's department?</li>
</ol>

<p>These questions motivate his coverage of grouping and aggregation;
once again he motivates every new idea,
no matter how small,
with a question someone might want answered.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a perfect book—it could use more diagrams, for example,
and I find the language overly formal in some places—but it&rsquo;s a very good one,
and the closest thing I&rsquo;ve seen in the wild
to Carroll&rsquo;s <a href="http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:architecture-load">minimal manual</a> approach to lesson design.
It isn&rsquo;t the right approach for every situation,
but I could have written <a href="../../../../sdxjs/"><em>Software Design by Example Using JavaScript</em></a> this way,
I would have.</p>
<p>All of which brings me to the point of this post,
which is that I <em>couldn&rsquo;t</em> write <a href="../../../../sdxjs/"><em>SDXJS</em></a> that way.
We couldn&rsquo;t have written <a href="../../../../js4ds/"><em>JavaScript for Data Science</em></a> in this style either,
though we could use it for some parts of
<em><a href="../../../../py-rse/">Research Software Engineering with Python</a></em>,
such as the introduction to the Unix shell and the introduction to Make.
The difference is that there are learning paths for the shell and Make that are
<em>continuously incrementally useful to the learner</em>,
i.e.,
we can arrange topics so that:</p>
<ol>
<li>each one is an <a href="http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#g:authentic-task">authentic task</a>, </li>
<li>each one extends or complicates a previous one, and</li>
<li>each extension or complication to the task aligns with an extension or complication to the system being taught.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to measure this,
but I&rsquo;m absolutely convinced that the reason the tidyverse is easier to teach to novices than Pandas
is that the tidyverse has these same properties.
Pandas is a powerful tool,
but between its complicated indexing syntax
and its non-linear reading order,
there&rsquo;s much more &ldquo;trust me, you&rsquo;ll need this later&rdquo;
than there is with the tidyverse.
JavaScript is much worse:
in order to do almost anything useful
you have to explain callbacks and promises
(which are super-useful in the same way that <a href="https://the-boys.fandom.com/wiki/Homelander">Homelander</a> is a super-hero).
The tool simply doesn&rsquo;t permit the same kind of learning ramp as some other systems.</p>
<p>Which brings me back to <a href="../../../../2021/01/23/but-can-she-type/">my favorite <em>Twilight Zone</em> episode</a>.
I know of languages that were designed for teaching,
but I don&rsquo;t know of a mainstream language whose creators asked instructional designers,
&ldquo;Can you see a ramp here?&rdquo;
while there was still a chance to build one.
You can&rsquo;t add security or usability to a tool after it&rsquo;s shipped;
equally,
I don&rsquo;t think you can add learnability—we just have to do our best
to find as gentle a path up the hill as we can.</p><!-- /content -->
