<p><em>The finger pointing at the moon is not the moon.</em></p>
<p>—variously attributed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tweeted yesterday
about using static website generator templates for lessons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Programmers follow many conventions to make code repos more usable,
    from having <code>README</code>, <code>LICENSE</code>, and <code>CONDUCT</code> files in the root directory
    to naming conventions, package structure, and having <code>make test</code> or <code>npm run test</code> do something useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every time I see an aggregation like this,
    I wish we had similar interoperability/discoverability conventions for tutorials.
    That doesn&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;one template to rule them all&rdquo;
    any more than it means every software project must have exactly the same structure, but…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>…imagine a world in which every tutorial had a <code>GLOSSARY</code> file beside its <code>README</code> and <code>LICENSE</code> files
    so that you could easily find out what terms that lesson defined
    (which in turn would tell you what it was about)?
    Or a convention for structuring exercises…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>…similar to the conventions that programming languages have for structuring tests
    (where they are, what they&rsquo;re called, etc.).
    There are standards for creating and packaging learning objects for use with learning management systems,
    but…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>…they are much too burdensome for most free-range teaching—it&rsquo;s as if our only options were chaos or Enterprise Java.
    I hope some day that creating a lesson on GitHub is as easy
    (i.e., as well supported both technically and socially)
    as creating a Node project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One way forward could start with a change of perspective:
    instead of thinking a package as &ldquo;code with some docs&rdquo;,
    think about it as &ldquo;docs with some supporting code&rdquo;.
    What would we have to add to turn a site like <a href="https://readthedocs.org">https://readthedocs.org</a> into a lesson hub?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auto-grading is a distraction in this context—it&rsquo;s certainly not a must-have,
    not even for coding lessons.
    (Proof: textbooks have been around and useful for centuries without auto-grading.)
    But think about things like…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>…consistent numbering of exercises and figures <em>across multiple source documents</em>.
    Think about learning objectives that can be put in each individual lesson,
    but extracted and collated as a summary.
    All of these things…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>…can be done with existing tools,
    but they&rsquo;re all harder and more fragile than documenting the parameters to a method
    or cross-referencing classes and their ancestors/decendants.
    (If your &ldquo;solution&rdquo; requires people to indent their YAML, it&rsquo;s not a solution.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And yes, the analogy with reusing code is flawed—the <a href="http://opencontent.org/docs/paradox.html">Reusability Paradox</a>
    is very real—but I believe <em>discoverability</em> and <em>interoperability</em> are worthwhile, achievable goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can I tell at a glance that a site or repo is a lesson rather than [noun]?
    What about the (human) language it&rsquo;s in?
    Ditto its major topics.
    We&rsquo;re done this part when I can search for &ldquo;lesson in Spanish about JavaScript callbacks&rdquo; with high signal-to-noise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is part of why we wrote <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008469">https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008469</a>
    (see also <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007854">https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007854</a>):
    we should listen to librarians &amp; teachers before we create more templates
    (but then, I think the world would be a better place if we all listened to librarians and teachers more…)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Much of the discussion that followed on Twitter and by email took the form,
&ldquo;If we build a good enough template, people will adopt it.&rdquo;
With respect,
I think that if better templates were the solution,
they would have worked by now.
I have written several myself,
including the first version of <a href="https://github.com/carpentries/styles/">the Carpentries template</a>;
I&rsquo;ve used several others,
and a search on GitHub turns up dozens of others.</p>
<p>The problem is that templates help <em>present</em> the lesson but don&rsquo;t help <em>write</em> it.
For example,
all of the templates I&rsquo;ve looked at allow authors to write whatever they want for learning objectives.
They don&rsquo;t help connect those objectives together
or check that the objectives are still consistent with the lesson&rsquo;s content:
&ldquo;still&rdquo; because lessons evolve over time,
and people forget to check and update objectives
just as they forget to check and update documentation and installation instructions for code.
Just as UML <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/35805/8/UML%20in%20practice%208.pdf">doesn&rsquo;t help developers solve the hard parts of their problems</a>,
static website frameworks don&rsquo;t help teachers any more than a Microsoft Word or Google Doc template.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s a slight exaggeration:
templates <em>do</em> help keep common values like the author&rsquo;s email address consistent.
However, the cost is very high:
installing Jekyll or Hugo,
writing YAML to configure them,
and getting the right plugins in place (never mind keeping them up to date)
is a hell of a cover charge.
The payoff seems small,
particularly if you aren&rsquo;t already steeped in the technology,
so on any given Thursday,
most teachers really are better off using Word or Docs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Glosario project (<a href="https://glosario.carpentries.org/">site</a>, <a href="https://github.com/carpentries/glosario">repo</a>)
is an experiment to see if we can do better.
Suppose you&rsquo;re writing a lesson about data science using Markdown.
Instead of using <strong>bold</strong> or <code>[an arbitrary link](http://somewhere/#term)</code> to highlight a definition,
you either:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>refer to <code>[the online glossary](https://glosario.carpentries.org/en/#term)</code> (in your preferred language), or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>call an inline function like <code>gloss('key', 'inline text')</code> to generate that text and link
    (if you&rsquo;re using something like R Markdown).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In both cases,
tools can now tell which terms a particular lesson defines.
Those terms can then be put in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of a web page,
stuffed in a database,
or added to a summary page for the course as a whole.
Doing this accomplishes two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It makes the lessons more discoverable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It allows to build another tool for stitching lessons together.
    People will not manually highlight all of the terms they use in a lesson that they don&rsquo;t define:
    it&rsquo;s too much work,
    and requires too much re-work as the glossary evolves.
    However,
    it would be relatively straightforward to compare the text of a lesson against a glossary
    to determine what terms it depends on
    so that we can say, &ldquo;You probably want to look at lessons X and Y before tackling lesson Z.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>No templating engine I know of will do this right now.
Most of them won&rsquo;t even do simpler but equally necessary things
like create two-part IDs for the figures within chapters
and then fill in references with <code>chapter.figure</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;ve used <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/">GitBook</a>,
<a href="https://www.bookdown.org/">Bookdown</a>,
and <a href="https://jupyterbook.org/">JupyterBook</a>.
No, they are not solutions for the 99.9% of our species
that can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t spend their afternoons messing with Pandoc templates,
LaTeX packages,
and conflicts between multiple YAML configuration files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like,
and yes,
I <em>do</em> think this would be a great project for someone doing a PhD in HCI:
finish the tooling for <a href="https://glosario.carpentries.org/">Glosario</a>,
fold it into lessons written with the template of your choice,
and tell us what you&rsquo;ve learned about how to build it
and about whether authors, instructors, and learners actually find it useful.
It may seem like a small thing,
but I bet it&rsquo;s harder than it looks,
and I bet we&rsquo;ll learn a lot more from doing it than we expect.
Most importantly,
I think it would a good first step toward shifting our attention from the page to the lesson.</p><!-- /content -->
