<!-- content --><p>I&rsquo;m blocked by a tech issue at work right now. I should do diagrams for <a href="../../../../sdxjs/"><em>Software Design by Example Using JavaScript</em></a>, but instead I&rsquo;m going to talk about good enough practices in teaching. Years ago we wrote a paper called &ldquo;<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745">Best Practices for Scientific Computing</a>&rdquo;. A lot of people found it useful, but a lot of other people found it intimidating (like, triathlete&rsquo;s daily workout intimidating), so we followed it up with &ldquo;<a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510">Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing</a>&rdquo; to describe more approachable things that the majority could do right away.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Good Enough&rdquo; paper did more than just describe &ldquo;start here&rdquo; practices. It also told readers, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be running CI on Docker with 100% test coverage to be a good person. It&rsquo;s OK if you work this way.&rdquo; Lang&rsquo;s book <em><a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-ca/Small+Teaching%3A+Everyday+Lessons+from+the+Science+of+Learning-p-9781118944493">Small Teaching</a></em> did the same for me when I read it—it said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK not to do <em>all</em> the right things.&rdquo; 
I say this myself in <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13ohFt3D0EJ5PDbMaWTxnHH-hwA7G0IvY">the instructor training class I run for RStudio</a> and in <em><a href="https://teachtogether.tech/">Teaching Tech Together</a></em>, but I get pushback. Ironically, some of the same education experts who would tell you to start novices with a simplified mental model of any other topic will get very huffy if you leave out the details when it comes to teaching and learning.</p>
<p>All of which is preface to me saying, here are the things I think the average programmer or data scientist can do to improve their teaching right away, <em>in order</em>. I&rsquo;d be grateful for additions and corrections.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add descriptive text to your slides. This helps people with vision or language comprehension issues; it also helps your future self (why do I have a picture of the Eiffel Tower labeled &ldquo;Not Leaning (Yet)&rdquo;?), but most importantly, it makes your material discoverable. Search engines struggle with images, diagrams, and spatially-significant layout of text. Give them prose to search so people can find your stuff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use formative assessment every 5-15 minutes while teaching. Each one should take at most a minute to do (so it doesn&rsquo;t derail teaching) and be designed to check for flaws in learners&rsquo; mental models rather than simple factual recall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always tell them how long they have to work on an in-class exercise or how long a homework problem should take; keep notes of how long the former actually took (and ask them to report the latter) so that you can correct your optimism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have learners share work in real time. Google Docs or HackMD&rsquo;s shared in groups of 5-15 works pretty well; if you&rsquo;re teaching in person (remember that?), have a few people join a Zoom call with you so that they can share their screen with you and you can project it for the class. (You&rsquo;d have them show each other what they&rsquo;ve made in a drawing or cooking class, wouldn&rsquo;t you?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep track of who has spoken so that you can distribute attention fairly throughout the class. Take-down stickies on laptops works in person; online, I keep a text file with learners&rsquo; names and cross them off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write the code in front of them so you can follow up their &ldquo;what if&rdquo; questions, and so that they learn how to use the tools. (Some people use VS Code or the RStudio IDE 2-10 times more effectively than others, and it adds up very quickly.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you make a mistake live coding, always (a) tell them how you know it&rsquo;s wrong, (b) talk through how you diagnose the problem, (c) explain the fix, and (d) point out the difference in the correct behavior or output.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now here&rsquo;s the sting in the tail: take a moment and compare the tutorials for your favorite software to these seven practices. If the tutorial scores more than 3/7, please give me a shout—I&rsquo;d really like to see it.</p><!-- /content -->
