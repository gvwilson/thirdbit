<h1>It Will Never Work in Theory</h1>



<p>From 2011 to 2023,
<a href="https://neverworkintheory.org/"><em>It Will Never Work in Theory</em></a> tried to bridge the gulf between theory and practice in software engineering
by publishing short summaries of empirical software engineering research and hosting talks by their authors.
<a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/so/5555/01/10424425/1Ulj1Qa8tJ6">This post-mortem</a> describes that effort and analyzes its failure,
while the current page reprints very short summaries I&rsquo;ve posted on Mastodon since NWIT shut down.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Leotta et al 2023: &ldquo;An empirical study to compare three web test automation approaches: NLP-based, programmable, and capture&amp;replay&rdquo; <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smr.2606">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smr.2606</a> The authors conclude that, &ldquo;… NLP-based test automation appears to be competitive for small- to medium-sized test suites such as those considered in our empirical study. It minimizes the total cumulative cost (development and evolution) and does not require software testers with programming skills.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suárez &amp; Viscaíno 2023: &ldquo;Stress, motivation, and performance in global software engineering&rdquo; <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smr.2600">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smr.2600</a> The authors carried out a systematic mapping of 118 published studies dealing with stress, motivation, and performance in global software engineering. The summary didn&rsquo;t have any particular surprises, but I&rsquo;ve bookmarked a bunch of references to chase up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kritikos &amp; Stamelos 2023: &ldquo;A resilience-based framework for assessing the evolution of open source software projects&rdquo; <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smr.2597">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smr.2597</a> The authors adapt a city resilience framework from urban studies to assess the resilience of open source software projects. I don&rsquo;t know nearly enough to judge the results, but it&rsquo;s an interesting idea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grabinger et al 2023: &ldquo;On the perception of graph layouts&rdquo; <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smr.2599">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smr.2599</a> uses eye tracking to explore how programmers look at graphs (which in turn has implications for how we ought to lay them out)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Sun et al 2024: &ldquo;AI Coders Are Among Us: Rethinking Programming Language Grammar Towards Efficient Code Generation&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16333">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16333</a> Designs a new grammar for Python that maintains the same AST for backward compatibility but reduces token usage for LLMs. I&rsquo;m still deeply ambivalent about LLMs for coding, but I think we&rsquo;re going to see a lot more of pre-existing tools being reshaped so that they work better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forward et al 2024: &ldquo;Super Mario in the Pernicious Kingdoms: Classifying Glitches in Old Games&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14870">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14870</a> This fun little paper uses a simple taxonomy of security errors to categorize glitches in Super Mario games. It won&rsquo;t change your life, but it was a fun read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Molléri 2024: &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Actually Being Studied? A Call for Population Analysis in Software Engineering Research&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15093">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15093</a> This short paper highlights shortcomings in the way empirical software engineering studies choose their subjects and then over-generalize their results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Salerno et al 2024: &ldquo;Open Source Software Development Tool Installation: Challenges and Strategies For Novice Developers&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14637">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14637</a> In my experience, getting started is the biggest obstacle most people face with new software tools (open or otherwise); I hope work like this will help change that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meng et al 2024: &ldquo;Program Environment Fuzzing&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13951">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13951</a> This is cool: &ldquo;record all observed environmental interactions at the kernel/user-mode boundary in the form of system calls. Next, we replay the program under the original recorded interactions, but this time with selective mutations applied, in order to get the effect of different program environments.&rdquo; The authors found 33 zero-day bugs and 14 CVEs were assigned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>de Souza Santos et al 2024: &ldquo;Exploring Hybrid Work Realities: A Case Study with Software Professionals From Underrepresented Groups&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13462">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13462</a> &ldquo;we analyzed the experiences of neurodivergents, LGBTQIA+ individuals, and people with disabilities…Hybrid work is preferred by software professionals from underrepresented groups in the post-pandemic era. Advantages include improved focus at home, personalized work setups, and accommodation for health treatments.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Patrick et al 2024: &ldquo;The Code the World Depends On: A First Look at Technology Makers&rsquo; Open Source Software Dependencies&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11763">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11763</a> openssl and zlib are at the top of the rankings; I was surprised that telecoms was so low when results were analyzed by industry sector (table 2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>McCormack et al 2024: &ldquo;A Study of Undefined Behavior Across Foreign Function Boundaries in Rust Libraries&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11671">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11671</a> &ldquo;Most of these errors were caused by incompatible aliasing and initialization patterns, incorrect foreign function bindings, and invalid type conversion. The majority of aliasing violations were caused by unsound operations in Rust, but they occurred in foreign code.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deiner &amp; Fraser: &ldquo;NuzzleBug: Debugging Block-Based Programs in Scratch&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14465">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14465</a> &ldquo;NuzzleBug is an interrogative debugger [for Scratch] that enables to ask questions about executions and provides answers explaining the behavior in question.&rdquo; cool tool - I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m ever going to get to teach kids again, but if I do, I want to give this a try.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Murphy-Hill et al 2024: &ldquo;GenderMag Improves Discoverability in the Field, Especially for Women&rdquo; <a href="https://cmustrudel.github.io/papers/icse24gendermag.pdf">https://cmustrudel.github.io/papers/icse24gendermag.pdf</a> &ldquo;… by combining self-reported gender data from tens of thousands of users…with software logs gathered over a five-year period, we show that GenderMag helped a team at Google (a) correctly identify discoverability as a usability barrier more likely to affect women than men, and (b) increase discoverability by 2.4x while also achieving gender parity.&rdquo;</p>

Furthermore, if we generate tests using Copilot without an existing test suite in place, we observe that 92.45% of the tests are failing, broken, or empty tests.&rdquo;</p>

Also, more contributors is associated with higher underproduction risk, but maintainer turnover is not.</p>
