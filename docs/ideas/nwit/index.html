<h1>It Will Never Work in Theory</h1>



<p>From 2011 to 2023,
<a href="https://neverworkintheory.org/"><em>It Will Never Work in Theory</em></a> tried to bridge the gulf between theory and practice in software engineering
by publishing short summaries of empirical software engineering research and hosting talks by their authors.
<a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/so/5555/01/10424425/1Ulj1Qa8tJ6">This post-mortem</a> describes that effort and analyzes its failure,
while the current page reprints very short summaries I&rsquo;ve posted on Mastodon since NWIT shut down.</p>
<dl>
<dt>1) Leotta et al 2023: &ldquo;An empirical study to compare three web test automation approaches: NLP-based, programmable, and capture&amp;replay&rdquo; <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smr.2606">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smr.2606</a></dt>
<dd>The authors conclude that, &ldquo;… NLP-based test automation appears to be competitive for small- to medium-sized test suites such as those considered in our empirical study. It minimizes the total cumulative cost (development and evolution) and does not require software testers with programming skills.&rdquo;</dd>
<dt>2) Suárez &amp; Viscaíno 2023: &ldquo;Stress, motivation, and performance in global software engineering&rdquo; <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smr.2600">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smr.2600</a></dt>
<dd>The authors carried out a systematic mapping of 118 published studies dealing with stress, motivation, and performance in global software engineering. The summary didn&rsquo;t have any particular surprises, but I&rsquo;ve bookmarked a bunch of references to chase up.</dd>
<dt>3) Kritikos &amp; Stamelos 2023: &ldquo;A resilience-based framework for assessing the evolution of open source software projects&rdquo; <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smr.2597">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smr.2597</a></dt>
<dd>The authors adapt a city resilience framework from urban studies to assess the resilience of open source software projects. I don&rsquo;t know nearly enough to judge the results, but it&rsquo;s an interesting idea.</dd>
<dt>4) Grabinger et al 2023: &ldquo;On the perception of graph layouts&rdquo; <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smr.2599">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smr.2599</a></dt>
<dd>uses eye tracking to explore how programmers look at graphs (which in turn has implications for how we ought to lay them out)</dd>
<dt>5) Tan et al 2024: &ldquo;How to Gain Commit Rights in Modern Top Open Source Communities?&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01803">https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01803</a></dt>
<dd>Constructs a taxonomy of committer qualifications with 26 codes categorized into nine themes.</dd>
<dt>6) Sun et al 2024: &ldquo;AI Coders Are Among Us: Rethinking Programming Language Grammar Towards Efficient Code Generation&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16333">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16333</a></dt>
<dd>Designs a new grammar for Python that maintains the same AST for backward compatibility but reduces token usage for LLMs. I&rsquo;m still deeply ambivalent about LLMs for coding, but I think we&rsquo;re going to see a lot more of pre-existing tools being reshaped so that they work better.</dd>
<dt>7) Forward et al 2024: &ldquo;Super Mario in the Pernicious Kingdoms: Classifying Glitches in Old Games&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14870">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14870</a></dt>
<dd>This fun little paper uses a simple taxonomy of security errors to categorize glitches in Super Mario games. It won&rsquo;t change your life, but it was a fun read.</dd>
<dt>8) Molléri 2024: &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Actually Being Studied? A Call for Population Analysis in Software Engineering Research&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15093">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15093</a></dt>
<dd>This short paper highlights shortcomings in the way empirical software engineering studies choose their subjects and then over-generalize their results.</dd>
<dt>9) Salerno et al 2024: &ldquo;Open Source Software Development Tool Installation: Challenges and Strategies For Novice Developers&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14637">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14637</a></dt>
<dd>In my experience, getting started is the biggest obstacle most people face with new software tools (open or otherwise); I hope work like this will help change that.</dd>
<dt>10) Meng et al 2024: &ldquo;Program Environment Fuzzing&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13951">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13951</a></dt>
<dd>This is cool: &ldquo;record all observed environmental interactions at the kernel/user-mode boundary in the form of system calls. Next, we replay the program under the original recorded interactions, but this time with selective mutations applied, in order to get the effect of different program environments.&rdquo; The authors found 33 zero-day bugs and 14 CVEs were assigned.</dd>
<dt>11) de Souza Santos et al 2024: &ldquo;Exploring Hybrid Work Realities: A Case Study with Software Professionals From Underrepresented Groups&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13462">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13462</a></dt>
<dd>&ldquo;we analyzed the experiences of neurodivergents, LGBTQIA+ individuals, and people with disabilities…Hybrid work is preferred by software professionals from underrepresented groups in the post-pandemic era. Advantages include improved focus at home, personalized work setups, and accommodation for health treatments.&rdquo;</dd>
<dt>12) Patrick et al 2024: &ldquo;The Code the World Depends On: A First Look at Technology Makers&rsquo; Open Source Software Dependencies&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11763">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11763</a></dt>
<dd>openssl and zlib are at the top of the rankings; I was surprised that telecoms was so low when results were analyzed by industry sector (table 2).</dd>
<dt>13) McCormack et al 2024: &ldquo;A Study of Undefined Behavior Across Foreign Function Boundaries in Rust Libraries&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11671">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11671</a></dt>
<dd>&ldquo;Most of these errors were caused by incompatible aliasing and initialization patterns, incorrect foreign function bindings, and invalid type conversion. The majority of aliasing violations were caused by unsound operations in Rust, but they occurred in foreign code.&rdquo;</dd>
<dt>14) Deiner &amp; Fraser: &ldquo;NuzzleBug: Debugging Block-Based Programs in Scratch&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14465">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14465</a></dt>
<dd>&ldquo;NuzzleBug is an interrogative debugger [for Scratch] that enables to ask questions about executions and provides answers explaining the behavior in question.&rdquo; cool tool - I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m ever going to get to teach kids again, but if I do, I want to give this a try.</dd>
<dt>15) Murphy-Hill et al 2024: &ldquo;GenderMag Improves Discoverability in the Field, Especially for Women&rdquo; <a href="https://cmustrudel.github.io/papers/icse24gendermag.pdf">https://cmustrudel.github.io/papers/icse24gendermag.pdf</a></dt>
<dd>&ldquo;… by combining self-reported gender data from tens of thousands of users…with software logs gathered over a five-year period, we show that GenderMag helped a team at Google (a) correctly identify discoverability as a usability barrier more likely to affect women than men, and (b) increase discoverability by 2.4x while also achieving gender parity.&rdquo;</dd>
<dt>16) Trinkenreich et al 2024: &ldquo;Unraveling the Drivers of Sense of Belonging in Software Delivery Teams&rdquo; <a href="https://www.ime.usp.br/~gerosa/papers/ICSE_2024___Belonging.pdf">https://www.ime.usp.br/~gerosa/papers/ICSE_2024___Belonging.pdf</a></dt>
<dd>This one looks really interesting, but I&rsquo;m going to wait until I&rsquo;m less feverish before trying to understand its statistical methods.</dd>
<dt>17) Etemadi et al 2024: &ldquo;Augmenting Diffs With Runtime Information&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11077">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11077</a></dt>
<dd>This paper presents a tool that compares the program states of old and new versions of code in order to identify unique variable values and adds that to the source code diff to help developers understand the impact of changes.</dd>
<dt>18) El Haji et al 2024: &ldquo;Using GitHub Copilot for Test Generation in Python&rdquo; <a href="https://carolin-brandt.de/publications/elhaji-ast24.pdf">https://carolin-brandt.de/publications/elhaji-ast24.pdf</a></dt>
<dd>&ldquo;…within an existing test suite, approximately 45.28% of the tests generated by Copilot are passing tests; 54.72% of generated tests are failing, broken, or empty tests. Furthermore, if we generate tests using Copilot without an existing test suite in place, we observe that 92.45% of the tests are failing, broken, or empty tests.&rdquo;</dd>
<dt>19) Bogdan &amp; Malavolta: &ldquo;An Empirical Study on the Impact of CSS Prefixes on the Energy Consumption and Performance of Mobile Web Apps&rdquo; <a href="https://www.ivanomalavolta.com/files/papers/mobilesoft_2024_css_prefixes.pdf">https://www.ivanomalavolta.com/files/papers/mobilesoft_2024_css_prefixes.pdf</a></dt>
<dd>&ldquo;CSS prefixes do not lead to an observable impact on the energy consumption of the measured Web apps, while their absence leads to a statistically significant increase of CPU usage in all browsers. The presence of CSS prefixes has a statistically significant negative impact on the loading time in all browsers and devices.&rdquo;</dd>
<dt>20) Jin et al 2024: &ldquo;Impact of Extensions on Browser Performance: An Empirical Study on Google Chrome&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06827">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06827</a></dt>
<dd>The most interesting thing in this paper for me was the authors&rsquo; use of energy consumption as a metric on an equal footing with page load time.</dd>
<dt>21) Hyrynsalmi et al 2024: &ldquo;Bridging Gaps, Building Futures: Advancing Software Developer Diversity and Inclusion Through Future-Oriented Research&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07142">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07142</a></dt>
<dd>&ldquo;we present insights from SE researchers and practitioners on challenges and solutions regarding diversity and inclusion in SE. Based on these findings, we share potential utopian and dystopian visions of the future and provide future research directions and implications for academia and industry&rdquo;</dd>
<dt>22) Osborne 2024: &ldquo;Public-private funding models in open source software development: A case study on scikit-learn&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06484">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06484</a></dt>
<dd>A useful exploration of an open source success story that will be of interest to anyone trying to make their own OS project financially sustainable.</dd>
<dt>23) Storey et al 2024: &ldquo;Guidelines for Using Mixed and Multi Methods Research in Software Engineering&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06011A">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06011A</a></dt>
<dd>useful starting point for people like me who want to understand where empirical findings come from and how to get answers ourselves.</dd>
<dt>24) Fan et al 2024: &ldquo;The Impact of Sanctions on GitHub Developers and Activities&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05489">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05489</a></dt>
<dd>&ldquo;In 2019, GitHub restricted access to certain services for users in specific locations but rolled back these restrictions for some communities (e.g., the Iranian community) in 2021. We conducted a large-scale empirical study, collecting approximately 156 thousand user profiles and their 41 million activity points from 2008 to 2022, to understand the response of developers.&rdquo;</dd>
<dt>25) Ma et al 2024: &ldquo;How to Teach Programming in the AI Era? Using LLMs as a Teachable Agent for Debugging&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05292">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05292</a></dt>
<dd>&ldquo;We introduce a novel system to facilitate deliberate practice on debugging, where human novices play the role of Teaching Assistants and help LLM-powered teachable agents debug code…students focus on hypothesizing the cause of code errors, while adjacent skills like code completion are offloaded to LLM-agents.&rdquo;</dd>
<dt>26) Assad et al 2024: &ldquo;Can My Microservice Tolerate an Unreliable Database? Resilience Testing with Fault Injection and Visualization&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01886">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01886</a></dt>
<dd>Describes a tool that systematically simulates database disruptions for testing both SQL and NoSQL databases.</dd>
<dt>27) Jovanovic and Sullivan: &ldquo;Right or Wrong-Understanding How Novice Users Write Software Models&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06624">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06624</a></dt>
<dd>Presents an empirical study of over 97,000 models written by novice users trying to learn Alloy and analyzes how novices write both correct and incorrect models.</dd>
<dt>28) Ben Braiek and Khomh: &ldquo;Machine Learning Robustness: A Primer&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00897">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00897</a></dt>
<dd>A chapter of a forthcoming book that provides an overview of what makes ML systems stable and reliable.</dd>
<dt>29) Lee et al 2024: &ldquo;Towards Optimizing Performance-Resource Trade-Off for Serverless Functions&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17574">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17574</a></dt>
<dd>We propose the first differentiated scheduler for runtime cold start mitigation by optimizing serverless function provision. Experiments demonstrate success in optimizing serverless function provision: reducing the 75th-percentile cold start rates by 49.77% and the wasted memory time by 56.43%, compared to the state-of-the-art.</dd>
<dt>30) Rahman et al 2024: &ldquo;Characterizing Dependency Update Practice of NPM, PyPI and Cargo Packages&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17382">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17382</a></dt>
<dd>We find that PyPI packages update dependencies faster than NPM and Cargo. Conversely, Cargo packages update their vulnerable dependencies faster than NPM and PyPI.</dd>
<dt>31) Gunatilake et al 2024: &ldquo;Enablers and Barriers of Empathy in Software Developer and User Interactions: A Mixed Methods Case Study&rdquo; <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3641849">https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3641849</a></dt>
<dd>Explores things that make developers <em>not</em> care about users.</dd>
<dt>32) Sülün et al 2024: &ldquo;An Empirical Analysis of Issue Templates Usage in Large-Scale Projects on GitHub&rdquo; <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3643673">https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3643673</a></dt>
<dd>Finds extensive usage of templates in 99 of the 100 surveyed projects, with a growing preference for YAML templates; projects with a template have reduced resolution time (381.02 days to 103.18 days) and reduced issue comment count (4.95 to 4.32) that those without.</dd>
<dt>33) Nam et al 2024: &ldquo;Understanding Documentation Use Through Log Analysis: An Exploratory Case Study of Four Cloud Services&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10817">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10817</a></dt>
<dd>&rdquo; By analyzing page-view logs for over 100,000 users…we show that which documentation pages people visit often correlates with user characteristics such as past experience with the specific product, on the one hand, and with future adoption of the API on the other hand.&rdquo;</dd>
<dt>34) Stray et al 2024: &ldquo;The Agile Coach Role: Coaching for Agile Performance Impact&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15738">https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15738</a></dt>
<dd>Reports results from semi-structured interviews with 19 agile coaches at 10 different companies. No big surprises, but it&rsquo;s nice to see this increasingly influential role put under the microscope.</dd>

<dd>&ldquo;The majority of fairness discussions revolve around the topic of income… Further…while not discussed as often, discussions on fairness in recruitment tend to receive the highest number of views and scores.&rdquo;</dd>
<dt>36) da Gião et al 2024: &ldquo;Chronicles of CI/CD: A Deep Dive into its Usage Over Time&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17588">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17588</a></dt>
<dd>Usage of CI/CD is tied to language (which may reflect developer age cohorts), and a surprising number of projects use multiple CI/CD technologies.</dd>
<dt>37) Druskat et al: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it: An approach to assess challenges to using software mentions for citation and discoverability research&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14602">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14602</a></dt>
<dd>Linking is poor and inconsistent; what makes this even more depressing is that <em>this</em> is the data AI models are being trained on…</dd>
<dt>38) Calefato et al: &ldquo;A Lot of Talk and a Badge: An Exploratory Analysis of Personal Achievements in GitHub&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14702">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14702</a></dt>
<dd>(1) Most developers have at least a badge, but an increasing number of users choose to keep their profile private and opt out of displaying badges. (2) Badges are generally poorly correlated with developers&rsquo; timeliness and desire to collaborate. (3) Except for the Starstruck badge (reflecting the number of followers), badges&rsquo; introduction does not have an effect.</dd>
<dt>39) Ehsani et al 2024: &ldquo;Incivility in Open Source Projects&rdquo; <a href="https://preethac.github.io/files/MSR24_Incivility_Dataset.pdf">https://preethac.github.io/files/MSR24_Incivility_Dataset.pdf</a></dt>
<dd>Presents a dataset of 404 locked GitHub issue discussion threads and 5961 individual comments from 213 OSS projects. &ldquo;Bitter frustration&rdquo;, &ldquo;Impatience&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Mocking&rdquo; are the most prevalent features in the dataset; the most common triggers, targets, and consequences of incivility include &ldquo;Failed use of tool/code or error messages&rdquo;, &ldquo;People&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Discontinued further discussion&rdquo;, respectively.</dd>

<dd>The authors manually label 3096 migration-related changes in 335 Python library migrations from 311 repositories [and] derive a taxonomy for migration-related changes. Among other things, they find that 40% of library pairs have API mappings that involve non-function program elements, while most library migration techniques assume function calls from the source will map into function calls from the target.</dd>
<dt>41) Erni et al 2024: &ldquo;SBFT Tool Competition 2024 &ndash; Python Test Case Generation Track&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15189">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15189</a></dt>

<dd>&ldquo;We find that core paid developers tend to contribute more frequently; commits contributed by one-time paid developers have bigger sizes; peripheral paid developers implement more features; and being paid plays a positive role in becoming a long-term contributor. We also find that volunteers do have some prejudices against paid developers.&rdquo;</dd>

<dd>Describes a plugin for JetBrains IDEs that offers the usual suspects (course outline, multiple choice questions, run-and-check) inside the IDE. Doesn&rsquo;t appear to drive the IDE to (for example) show learners how to use a breakpointing debugger or the refactoring tools, and doesn&rsquo;t appear to have any support for lesson discovery.</dd>
<dt>47) Champion &amp; Mako Hill: &ldquo;Sources of Underproduction in Open Source Software&rdquo; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11281">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11281</a></dt>
<dd>Open source software is often underproduced: its relative quality is lower than its relative importance. This paper examines underproduction in Debian. It finds that software age and programming language age are partly responsible, but the association is weaker in older languages. Also, more contributors is associated with higher underproduction risk, but maintainer turnover is not.</dd>

<dd>Most projects study a subset of public open source projects, but how does subsetting affect findings? This paper randomly samples 100K repositories and uses multiple regression to model the number of stars based on tseveral fcators. It finds filtering significantly alters results, and recommends using either complete data or stratified sampling to avoid bias.</dd>

<dd>&ldquo;We present…a taxonomy of LLM-based study types together with eight guidelines for designing and reporting empirical studies involving LLMs.&rdquo; This is important and useful work, and I hope the authors and others start scoring various reports and claims (both peer-reviewed and otherwise) using this checklist.</dd>

<dd>The authors built a bots-only &ldquo;social&rdquo; network and found it inevitably spiraled down into partisan echo chambers, elite formation, and polarization. None of the six mitigation strategies they implemented (including chronological feeds, hiding likes, and bridging strategies) changed those outcomes.</dd>
<dt>174) Knutsen et al 2026: &ldquo;Do-or-die software projects in Norway during the COVID-19 pandemic&rdquo; <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121225002560">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121225002560</a></dt>
<dd>The paper looks at Norwegian public institutions that had defied conventional wisdom about public sector inertia by successfully completing important, urgent, and unexpected development efforts, and identifies four common factors that led to success: (1) antecedent capabilities for collaboration, use of expertise, and interdisciplinary problem-solving; (2) characteristics of the project mandates including specificity of goals, importance, deadlines, and tie-in with societal mission; (3) emergent development practices that empowered a core team to make decisions, benefit from organizational support, and integrate effectively with diverse stakeholders; and (4) outcomes that reinforced the practices, such as success, pride in work, transparency, and continuous capability development.</dd>

<dd>The partner of a friend of mine is high-functioning autistic, and regards ChatGPT as a disability aid because it can get the tone of conversation right in a way that he has always struggled with. This brief paper looks at using such tools to support developers with ADHD; I don&rsquo;t know enough to evaluate it, but it&rsquo;s a really interesting use case.</dd>
