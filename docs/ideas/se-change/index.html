<h1>A Roadmap for Changing Software Engineering</h1>



<ul>
<li>Want to change (people in) tech</li>
<li>Have wasted a lot of time on things that didn&rsquo;t work</li>
<li>So want to iterate on ideas before starting</li>
</ul>
<h2>Goal, Strategy, and Tactics</h2>
<ul>
<li>Goal: want tech companies to be more ethical and responsible<ul>
<li>Which really means &ldquo;want people working in tech to be ethical and responsible&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strategy: raise consciousness in ways that programmers will actually engage with<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Raise consciousness&rdquo; ==
    &ldquo;make people more aware of how the industry and our society actually work&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Will actually engage with&rdquo; ==
    &ldquo;hook their curiosity rather than preaching at them in ways that don&rsquo;t make them feel ignorant&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tactics: teach the young and not-so-young<ul>
<li>Alter or replace undergraduate software engineering courses with ones that include alternative non-technical material
    (where &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; == &ldquo;not Silicon Valley ideology&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Offer short Carpentries-style workshops for people already in industry
    using material shared with those undergraduate courses</li>
<li>Use stories and scenarios to make material more engaging</li>
<li>Build a coalition of the willing to create, maintain, and deliver these classes and workshops</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personas</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sami Student<ul>
<li>20 years old;
    in his final year of a BSc in Software Engineering;
    has done two work terms and taken introductory courses in Economics and Statistics.</li>
<li>Wants to start his own company &ldquo;just like Elon Musk&rdquo;;
    makes jokes about DEI hires and about other students&rsquo; lack of job prospects.</li>
<li>Father (also a programmer) was recently laid off despite his employer posting record profits;
    Sami wants to understand how that happened,
    and why some of his classmates have started sharing anti-immigrant memes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Paola Professor<ul>
<li>38 years old, has had tenure for three years;
    research focus is energy consumption of large computer systems.</li>
<li>Enjoys teaching,
    but disappointed that most of her students don&rsquo;t seem to care about anything except their job prospects.</li>
<li>Overworked;
    frustrated by how hard it is to make meaningful changes at her university,
    particularly when it comes to hiring and promotion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dacey Developer<ul>
<li>29 years old;
    non-binary but finds it easiest not to correct people who don&rsquo;t use their preferred pronouns.</li>
<li>Has been building mobile applications for seven years;
    takes pride in the quality of their work;
    is now technical lead of a three-person team.</li>
<li>Wants to be a good manager but finds most books on the subject vague, dull, or both.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Four Options</h2>
<ul>
<li>Presented in order of increasing radicalism</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reform">Gradual Reform</h3>
<ul>
<li>Plan: add a little to existing courses</li>
<li>Pro:<ul>
<li>Low effort to create</li>
<li>Less likely to frighten potential adopters</li>
<li>Early feedback</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Con:<ul>
<li>Won&rsquo;t have much impact on learners in either the short or long term</li>
<li>First thing to be cut when time runs short (which it always does)</li>
<li>Unlikely to excite people</li>
<li>Unlikely to attract funding</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="setper">The Responsible Programmer</h3>
<ul>
<li>Plan: teach tools, processes, evidence, and responsibility in team capstone courses<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Tools&rdquo; because intended audience accepts them as valid</li>
<li>&ldquo;Processes&rdquo; because tools aren&rsquo;t useful unless you know how to use them</li>
<li>&ldquo;Evidence&rdquo; because we want to know which tools and processes actually work</li>
<li>&ldquo;Responsibility&rdquo; to both teammates (fair play) and society as a whole,
    because once you know how to interpret evidence,
    it&rsquo;s hard not to see the harm we&rsquo;re doing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pro:<ul>
<li>Medium effort to create</li>
<li>Gradual escalation from where people are to where we want them to be</li>
<li>Ties concepts together</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Con:<ul>
<li>Later material more likely to be cut because of time pressure (and discomfort)</li>
<li>Hard to subsection material for workshops:
    early content is already covered elsewhere,
    later will feel like &ldquo;jump in at the deep end&rdquo; on its own</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note: the title is a deliberate play on the title of <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em><ul>
<li>Making pragmatic compromises got us into this mess</li>
<li>See <a href="https://gvwilson.github.io/setper/">this site</a> for a more detailed outline</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="observe">Observability, Research Methods, and Enlightened Skepticism</h3>
<ul>
<li>Plan: teach programmers to distinguish reliable research from plausible punditry<ul>
<li>Use the problem of observing programmer productivity as the motivating issue</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pro:<ul>
<li>Topical: debates about impact of AI are vacuous without shared, reliable understanding of what productivity means</li>
<li>Motivates study of both qualitative and quantitative methods</li>
<li>Highlights the difference between evidence-based argument and self-confident and/or self-serving opinions</li>
<li>Practical exercises are easy to create</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Con:<ul>
<li>Medium effort to create</li>
<li>May be seen as niche:
    people won&rsquo;t understand observability and productivity are just being used as a working example</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note: see <a href="https://gvwilson.github.io/observe/">this site</a> for a more detailed outline</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sdgc">Social Studies for Software Engineers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Plan: summarize key insights from social sciences that are directly related to tech industry<ul>
<li>Who decides what&rsquo;s allowed on the internet?</li>
<li>Why don&rsquo;t software engineers need to be licensed?</li>
<li>Does strong encryption do more harm than good?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pro:<ul>
<li>Addresses the end goal directly</li>
<li>Content (and controversy) might attract attention outside tech</li>
<li>An opportunity to connect with people outside tech</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Con:<ul>
<li>Large effort to create</li>
<li>Potential instructors will have to learn the content as well</li>
<li>Will require partnership with people outside tech
    who may not understand what programmers are willing to sit through</li>
<li>Will be seen as &ldquo;political&rdquo; (and encounter resistance as a result)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note: see <a href="../../talks/sdgc/">this talk</a> for a more detailed outline</li>
</ul>
