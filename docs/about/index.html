<hr />
<p>I was born in 1963 and grew up on <a href="http://www.town.lakecowichan.bc.ca/">Vancouver Island</a>,
where two inches of rain is considered a light shower.
I completed a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Mathematics and Engineering at <a href="http://www.queensu.ca">Queen&rsquo;s University</a> in 1984,
then worked in Ottawa before moving to Edinburgh
to do a Master&rsquo;s degree in Artificial Intelligence.
I spent the next six years working at the <a href="http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/">Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre</a>
while doing a Ph.D. in Computer Science (which I completed in 1992)
and writing popular science articles for <em>The Independent</em> and <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/"><em>New Scientist</em></a>.</p>
<p>Over the next few years
I wrote and edited <a href="../bib/">my first few books</a>
while doing post-doctoral work at several universities
and working at IBM, a data visualization startup, and Los Alamos National Laboratory.
I became involved in open source development, particularly Python,
and started playing the saxophone and Ultimate frisbee (though not simultaneously).
From 2000 to 2004 I was a contributing editor with <em>Doctor Dobb&rsquo;s Journal</em>
and part of a computer security startup that was eventually acquired by Hewlett-Packard.
I also published my first children&rsquo;s book and met the woman I&rsquo;m married to,
and in 2007 we became the happy parents of a wonderful troublemaker.</p>
<p>I was a professor in <a href="http://web.cs.toronto.edu/">Computer Science</a>
at the <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a> from 2007 to 2010,
during which time I helped create a <a href="https://mscac.utoronto.ca/">Master&rsquo;s degree in Applied Computing</a>,
was named ComputerWorld Canada&rsquo;s &ldquo;IT Educator of the Year&rdquo;,
and published some more books
(one of which, <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/beautiful-code/9780596510046/"><em>Beautiful Code</em></a>, won a Jolt Award).</p>
<p>I left academia in 2010
and spent the next seven years building <a href="https://carpentries.org/">Software Carpentry</a> into
a worldwide volunteer organization that teaches basic computing skills to thousands of researchers every year.
Somewhere in there I found time to edit
<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/making-software/9780596808310/">a book on evidence-based software engineering</a>
and the first two volumes of <a href="https://aosabook.org/"><em>The Architecture of Open Source Applications</em></a>.
After a stint at <a href="http://rangle.io">Rangle.io</a> in 2017 I joined DataCamp,
who I&rsquo;m proud to say <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/datacamp-sexual-harassment-metoo-tech-startup">fired me in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>More recently I developed an <a href="http://education.rstudio.com/trainers">instructor training and certification program</a> for RStudio (now Posit)
and was briefly Head of Education for <a href="http://www.metabase.com/">Metabase</a>
before working as a software engineering manager at <a href="https://deepgenomics.com/">Deep Genomics</a> and now <a href="https://plotly.com/">Plotly</a>.
In my free time I helped build TidyBlocks and <a href="https://glosario.carpentries.org/">Glosario</a>
and wrote or co-wrote <a href="http://teachtogether.tech"><em>Teaching Tech Together</em></a>,
<a href="../js4ds/"><em>JavaScript for Data Science</em></a>,
<a href="../py-rse/"><em>Research Software Engineering with Python</em></a>,
and a pair of books called <em>Software Design by Example</em> in <a href="../sdxjs/">JavaScript</a> and <a href="../sdxpy/">Python</a>.
