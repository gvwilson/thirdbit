   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Years ago, &lt;a href=&#34;https://exple.tive.org/blarg/2025/11/11/historical-reasons-2/&#34;&gt;Mike Hoye suggested&lt;/a&gt; that we should retire Unix usernames
in the way that sports teams retire jersey numbers,
and for the same reasons.
I was reminded of this while doing interviews with people about how projects end;
a couple of other ideas that have come up are adding a &lt;code&gt;-eol&lt;/code&gt; (end-of-life) modified to semantic versioning
similar to the &lt;code&gt;-beta&lt;/code&gt; modifier,
so that &lt;code&gt;1.2.3-eol&lt;/code&gt; would mean &amp;ldquo;this is the last release this project is going to do&amp;rdquo;,
and holding wakes for projects so that people can celebrate the contributions they &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; make
and the impact they &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; have.

   <title>Cognitive Pollution</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: I have posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/f86KBeJ7e2M&#34;&gt;a recording of the talk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am grateful to &lt;a href=&#34;https://sback.it/&#34;&gt;Prof. Alberto Bacchelli&lt;/a&gt;
for inviting me to give a colloquium at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en.html&#34;&gt;University of Zurich&lt;/a&gt;
a couple of days ago.
My talk was titled &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/talks/sdgc/&#34;&gt;Cocaine and Conway&amp;rsquo;s Law&lt;/a&gt;,
but what it was really about was how to teach young software developers about &lt;em&gt;cognitive pollution&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When most existing software engineering courses talk about risk,
they talk about single-point incidents like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25&#34;&gt;Therac-25&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_flight_V88&#34;&gt;Ariane 5 flight V88&lt;/a&gt;
where there is a direct cause-and-effect relationship between a mistake in software and something bad happening.
I think we should instead talk about things like
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraethyllead&#34;&gt;tetraethyl lead&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos&#34;&gt;asbestos&lt;/a&gt;,
or about &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_Pharma&#34;&gt;Purdue Pharma&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s role in the opioid epidemic
and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuels_lobby&#34;&gt;fossil fuels lobby&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s campaign
to promote &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_denial&#34;&gt;climate change denial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of these cases,
deliberate choices increased the general level of risk to hundreds of millions of people,
but the statistical nature of that risk
allowed those responsible to avoid personal accountability.
I think that case studies like these will help learners understand things like
the role that Meta&amp;rsquo;s algorithms played in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohingya_genocide&#34;&gt;Rohingya genocide&lt;/a&gt;
and think more clearly about scenarios like the one below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is 2035.
Most men under 20 have learned what they &amp;ldquo;know&amp;rdquo; about what women like
from AI chatbots trained on porn and tuned to maximize engagement.
As a result,
many of them believe that a frightened &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; actually means &amp;ldquo;yes please&amp;rdquo;.
The people who have earned billions from these systems
cannot legally be held accountable for their users&amp;rsquo; actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does that make you feel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are currently teaching an undergraduate course that covers cases like these,
please &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com&#34;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;:
I&amp;rsquo;d be grateful for a chance to learn from you.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>One Small Command</title>
   <link href="https://third-bit.com/2025/10/18/one-small-command/"/>
   <updated>2025-10-18T00:00:00Z</updated>
   <id>https://third-bit.com/2025/10/18/one-small-command/</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that I am suffering from jet lag and recovering from a bad cold while writing this,
which means my proposal may well be garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of conversations over the years about
the differences in how software engineers and data scientists work.
One example is how they manage software:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software engineers regard duplicated code as sinful and refactor to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data scientists routinely copy a notebook or a script and make small changes to do a new data analysis.
    After many years,
    I have accepted that they are right to do so:
    their analyses are often exploratory one-offs,
    so copy-and-modify is more efficient than generalize-and-parameterize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that software engineers build tools for software engineers,
which means they don&amp;rsquo;t automatically support data scientists&amp;rsquo; workflows.
Continuing the refactor-versus-copy example,
Git doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a way to explicitly say &amp;ldquo;this file started as a copy of that one&amp;rdquo;.
Git has a way to say &amp;ldquo;this file was moved or renamed&amp;rdquo; (&lt;code&gt;git mv&lt;/code&gt;),
but there isn&amp;rsquo;t a corresponding &lt;code&gt;git cp&lt;/code&gt; command
because software engineers believe that you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be doing that.
You can ask Git to guess which files were copied in each commit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;git log --find-copies --diff-filter=C --stat
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but (a) you probably didn&amp;rsquo;t know this existed,
(b) you&amp;rsquo;re not going to remember it,
and (c) Git&amp;rsquo;s heuristics often produce incorrect answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s add &lt;code&gt;git cp&lt;/code&gt; so that the log records copying events explicitly.
That will allow us to trace the lineage of copied-and-modified notebooks and scripts
(and the copied-and-modified configuration files that software engineers create
because they don&amp;rsquo;t think of YAML and TOML as code).
Doing this won&amp;rsquo;t solve all our traceability problems,
but I think it will solve some of them,
and we&amp;rsquo;ll learn something useful from its failure if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

is the book I&amp;rsquo;ve been hoping to find for years.
It includes sections on managing yourself, managing others, and coaching future leaders,
all grounded in first-hand experience and empirical research.
I wish it included more on &lt;a href=&#34;https://gvwilson.github.io/change/&#34;&gt;organizational change&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/2025/09/12/searching-for-closure/&#34;&gt;winding projects down&lt;/a&gt;,
but those are &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; preoccupations:
as is,
it would be a great foundation for a Carpentries-style workshop,
and I hope someone creates that.&lt;/p&gt;

she would always grab a fresh glass for water instead of re-using the one that she had just emptied,

Now that she has left home,
I only need to load the dishwasher once a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I wish I still had to load it twice.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Time Spent on Hardening</title>
   <link href="https://third-bit.com/2025/09/18/time-spent-on-hardening/"/>
   <updated>2025-09-18T00:00:00Z</updated>
   <id>https://third-bit.com/2025/09/18/time-spent-on-hardening/</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently received mail from someone working on a software-based approach to fault tolerance.
Their tool makes applications more reliable,
but they think it also makes developers more productive
by reducing the amount of error detection and handling code they need write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have never been able to find research
that quantifies how much time developers spend on code for detecting and handling problems
relative to the effort for the &amp;ldquo;happy path&amp;rdquo;.
they know it&amp;rsquo;s substantial,
and is (probably) increasing as applications become more distributed,
but the only number they&amp;rsquo;ve found is from a 1995 book called
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780471950684&#34;&gt;Software Fault Tolerance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,
where Dr. Flaviu Cristian says that it often accounts for more than two-thirds of code in production systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I asked a dozen researchers I met through &lt;a href=&#34;https://neverworkintheory.org&#34;&gt;It Will Never Work in Theory&lt;/a&gt;
if they knew of anything,
and the answer was, &amp;ldquo;No, there isn&amp;rsquo;t anything that specifically addresses that question.&amp;rdquo;
This strikes me as odd,
because it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be hard to measure
and the answer would be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People do throw around questionable numbers about the cost of bugs and bug fixing,
e.g., claim that companies &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.it-cisq.org/cisq-files/pdf/CPSQ-2020-report.pdf&#34;&gt;$2 trillion in 2020&lt;/a&gt;.

    with some days being dedicated to the task (up to 32%)
    and some days being dedicated to meetings and collaboration (4-6%).
    You can also add time spent on testing (up to 16%).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Searching for Closure</title>
   <link href="https://third-bit.com/2025/09/12/searching-for-closure/"/>
   <updated>2025-09-12T00:00:00Z</updated>
   <id>https://third-bit.com/2025/09/12/searching-for-closure/</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For every beginning there must be an ending,
but we don&amp;rsquo;t like to talk about that,
particularly not in the tech industry.
There are thousands of books in print about how to start a business,
but only a handful about how to pass one on,
and many of those are really about how to sell out at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have experienced a lot of endings,
and the most important thing I&amp;rsquo;ve learned is that
they can be dignified and fulfilling if done well.
I also think that preparing for the end can make it less likely,
and make what happens before it more enjoyable.
However,
a lot of people aren&amp;rsquo;t being given the chance
to wind things down gracefully.
Between the Trump administration&amp;rsquo;s attack on science
and the cuts big tech companies are making in the name of AI,
thousands of people are being given days (or less) to end years of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am therefore assembling material for a half-day workshop on project closure.
If you or someone you know has ended a software project or scientific research project,
I&amp;rsquo;d be very grateful if you could spare half an hour for an online interview:
you can reach me by email at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com&#34;&gt;gvwilson@third-bit.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: all discussion will be confidential,
and everyone interviewed will be able to review and veto anything that mentions them
before it is seen by anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learner Personas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are important differences between &lt;em&gt;deliberate closure&lt;/em&gt;
(shutting a project down of your own accord and on your own timeline),
and &lt;em&gt;abrupt closure&lt;/em&gt;
(shutting it down on short notice under difficult circumstances).
This workshop therefore caters to two learner personas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Vaida&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vaida, 33, has a PhD in oceanography
    and now works as a data analyst for the Ministry of the Environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She has been collecting and publishing beach erosion data for the past six years.
    She also co-founded a volunteer group that teaches environmental science to high school students,
    and has been its leader for the past five years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vaida is relocating to pursue a new career opportunity,
    so she wants to wind down her data collection project.
    She also wants the volunteer group to continue its work,
    but the only documentation of how it operates is
    one slide deck and a couple of out-of-date blog posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vaida is working hard to prepare for her new job,
    which means only has two or three hours a week for the next couple of months
    to put into tidying things up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Liam&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liam, 41, worked as a civil engineer for almost a decade
    before becoming a full-time software developer
    at a company that does contract work
    modeling slope stability for large construction projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While Liam writes lots of tests and uses Git and GitHub to share work with his colleagues,
    very little of what he knows about OpenStabil
    (the company&amp;rsquo;s open source software package)
    has ever been written down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liam&amp;rsquo;s group was acquired by another engineering firm sixteen months ago.
    After an abrupt change of leadership,
    the company has decided to merge parts of OpenStabil into a closed-source tool suite
    and to stop all further development of the open version.
    Liam has been told to make these changes immediately;
    after protest,
    he has been given until the end of the week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liam is deeply invested in the small but tight-knit OpenStabil community,
    but has a young family at home
    and doesn&amp;rsquo;t dare risk being unemployed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content>

   <updated>2025-09-05T00:00:00Z</updated>
   <id>https://third-bit.com/2025/09/05/mastodon-and-webbly/</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was going to title this post &amp;ldquo;Two Great Tastes That Taste Great Together&amp;rdquo;,
but I expect most of my readers are too young to get the reference,
so I&amp;rsquo;ll just dive right in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glitch gave literally millions of people a chance to build something on the web
    without having to wrestle with NPM or webpack
    or set up a server
    or deal with any of the other crap that Sumana Harihareswara has dubbed
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.harihareswara.net/posts/2016/inessential-weirdnesses-in-open-source-software-oscon-2016/&#34;&gt;inessential weirdness&lt;/a&gt;.
    It was beautiful and useful,
    but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t profitable enough for Fastly to keep it alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the idea of a low-overhead in-the-browser way for the 99% to build things
    didn&amp;rsquo;t start with Glitch
    and hasn&amp;rsquo;t died with it either.
    Projects like &lt;a href=&#34;https://make.webblythings.com/&#34;&gt;Webbly&lt;/a&gt; (source &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pomax/make-webbly-things&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)
    are still trying to let people use the web to build the web.
    However,
    someone has to host these things somewhere:
    who&amp;rsquo;s going to do that, and where?
    More specifically,
    can we construct a hosting solution that isn&amp;rsquo;t tied to a particular company
    and therefore doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a singular point of failure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well,
    what about &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(social_network)&#34;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;?
    Its authors and users are deeply committed to decentralization and federation,
    and more people are running servers for particular communities every day.
    What if (wait, hear me out)
    what if Webbly was bundled with Mastodon
    so that Mastodon site admins could provide an in-the-browser page-building experience to their users
    simply by saying &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; to one configuration option?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would they do that?
    My answer is,
    &amp;ldquo;Take a look at Mastodon&amp;rsquo;s default browser interface.&amp;rdquo;
    It lets you add a couple of pictures and a few links to your profile,
    but that&amp;rsquo;s less than &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace&#34;&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt; offered twenty years ago.
    I am 100% certain that if Mastodon came with an easy in-browser page builder,
    people would use it to create all sorts of wonderful things.
    (Awful ones too, of course, but Mastodon site admins already have to grapple with content admin.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule&#34;&gt;Greenspun&amp;rsquo;s Tenth Rule&lt;/a&gt; is that every sufficiently complicated program
contains a mediocre implementation of Lisp.
Equally,
I think every useful web-based tool is trying to be
what Visual Basic was in the 1990s
and WordPress was to the early web:
useful, right there, and a gradual ramp for new users rather than a cliff to climb.
I think the sort of people who built useful little things with Glitch
would do amazing things with Webbly
if it was married to their social media.
I also think that allowing people to create custom home pages
or tweak their feeds
would draw a lot of new users away from fragile, centralized systems like X and Bluesky.
I know that I&amp;rsquo;ve been wrong far more often than I&amp;rsquo;ve been right,
but this really does feel promising.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>If I Retired</title>
   <link href="https://third-bit.com/2025/09/04/if-i-retired/"/>
   <updated>2025-09-04T00:00:00Z</updated>
   <id>https://third-bit.com/2025/09/04/if-i-retired/</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If I retired tomorrow,
here&amp;rsquo;s how I would would to spend each week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/fiction/&#34;&gt;fiction&lt;/a&gt;.
    I&amp;rsquo;m making slow but steady progress on a couple of middle-grade books
    and need another 30,000 words to finish off a YA novel I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on for several years.
    I started writing them for my daughter when she was young;
    she&amp;rsquo;s now in university,
    and unlikely to find them as engaging as she once would have,
    but I&amp;rsquo;d still like to finish them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helping to assemble a new kind of undergraduate software engineering course
    in which learners explore what it means for programmers to be productive
    and how we can make it &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/ideas/se-change/#observe&#34;&gt;observable&lt;/a&gt;.
    I think this would be a good way to introduce young programmers to
    the difference between reliable research and plausible punditry,
    but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to tackle it on my own:
    I don&amp;rsquo;t (yet) know enough about productivity and observability in software development,
    and too many of the projects that seemed like good ideas to me at the time
    have turned out to have &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/2021/07/22/whatever-happened-to-tidyblocks/&#34;&gt;fatal flaws&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaching.
    I&amp;rsquo;m about to teach &lt;a href=&#34;https://gvwilson.github.io/change/&#34;&gt;a workshop on organizational change&lt;/a&gt;,
    and helping with &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06484&#34;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; has convinced me that
    one on how to end projects gracefully would be useful too.
    Really,
    though,
    I just want to get back in the classroom:
    for better or worse,
    AI Is the biggest change in teaching and learning in my adult lifetime,
    and I want to be in the thick of it rather than opining from the sidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing housework,
    playing the sax,
    and riding my bike or swimming (depending on the season and the state of my knees).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I would want most,
though,
is a circle of friends to do these things with.
I love my wife very much,
but I&amp;rsquo;m never going to enjoy gardening or cooking as much as she does,
and boardgames like &lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2655/hive&#34;&gt;Hive&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/194655/santorini&#34;&gt;Santorini&lt;/a&gt; aren&amp;rsquo;t ever going to be her thing.
I always thought &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/2018/03/20/goodbye-jeff/&#34;&gt;my younger brother&lt;/a&gt; and I
would wind up playing chess in the park in our twilight years;
as the nights grow longer and the leaves begin to turn,
I&amp;rsquo;d like to have other people to do that with.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Things I&#39;m Looking For</title>
   <link href="https://third-bit.com/2025/08/21/things-im-looking-for/"/>
   <updated>2025-08-21T00:00:00Z</updated>
   <id>https://third-bit.com/2025/08/21/things-im-looking-for/</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Following up on &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/2025/08/15/productivity-workshop-ideas/&#34;&gt;my recent plea&lt;/a&gt;
for material to use in a workshop on productivity for software engineers,
I&amp;rsquo;d also be grateful for material on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;How to hand off or wind down a research project or open source software project.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;For every beginning there must be an ending, but we don&amp;rsquo;t like to talk about them.
For example, there are thousands of books in print about how to start a business,
but only a handful about how to pass one on or wind one down,
and many of those are really about how to sell out at the right time.
I think the reason is that mortality scares us,
but preparing for the end can make the end less likely,
and can help make what happens before then more enjoyable.
If you have ever shut something down or handed it over after several years,
please &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com&#34;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;A legal and business comparison of the new generation of software licenses.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Source_License&#34;&gt;Business Source License&lt;/a&gt;
has attracted a lot of fire from open source zealots;
the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/license&#34;&gt;Unreal Engine license&lt;/a&gt;
also puts restrictions on use,
but hasn&amp;rsquo;t caused nearly as much yelling.
If anyone has written a level-headed compare-and-contrast of licenses
that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://opensource.org/&#34;&gt;Open Source Initiative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;hasn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; blessed,
but which give users more rights than a standard closed-source license,
I&amp;rsquo;d be very grateful for a pointer—again,
please &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com&#34;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;

   <title>Productivity Workshop Ideas</title>
   <link href="https://third-bit.com/2025/08/15/productivity-workshop-ideas/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Suppose you were going to build a one-day hands-on tutorial for software engineers
on what &amp;ldquo;productivity&amp;rdquo; means and how to observe it
(which might or might not include measuring it quantitatively).
You have 6x30 minutes to talk and 4x45 minutes for practical exercises.
(Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s only six hours, but you need to leave time for questions, coffee breaks, lunch, etc.)
If each of those six slots is built around one particular research paper,
what are the papers?
And what are the four exercises?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peer-reviewed research papers please, not opinion pieces from industry pundits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Papers, not books (but I&amp;rsquo;ll accept chapters from books as &amp;ldquo;papers&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tools and data used in the exercises has to be openly accessible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have suggestions, please [email me][email], and thank you in advance.
If there are enough useful comments, I&amp;rsquo;ll organize an online discussion of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why productivity?
Because it affords a good mix of &amp;ldquo;how do we collect and analyze data?&amp;rdquo;,
&amp;ldquo;when are quantitative and qualitative analysis the right tools?&amp;rdquo;,
and &amp;ldquo;how do we operationalize a question like this?&amp;rdquo;
It&amp;rsquo;s also very topical—most discussions of the impact of AI are vacuous
because we&amp;rsquo;re arguing about performance improvements without first defining
performance—and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of research out there to draw on.
I also hope it will draw interest from both the research community
and research-friendly practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>This Week&#39;s Posts</title>
   <link href="https://third-bit.com/2025/08/13/this-weeks-posts/"/>
   <updated>2025-08-13T00:00:00Z</updated>
   <id>https://third-bit.com/2025/08/13/this-weeks-posts/</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;(Including one from two weeks ago.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2025-07-30&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what would be a really thought-provoking team project for undergrad software engineering students?
Building a dashboard that measures and reports programmers&amp;rsquo; productivity and identifies process bottlenecks.
Lots of coding,
lots of requirements gathering,
lots of UI design,
and &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of &amp;ldquo;what the hell are we actually measuring and do we believe it&amp;rsquo;s meaningful?&amp;rdquo;
which would be the most illuminating part of the whole exercise for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2025-08-09&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/2012/01/21/the-life-i-did-live-the-breath-i-breathed/&#34;&gt;My sister Sylvia&lt;/a&gt;
died of pancreatic cancer in 2012 at the age of 47,
leaving three teenage children behind.
The mRNA cancer vaccine being developed in the US was the best hope we&amp;rsquo;ve ever had to prevent this.
The Trump Administration&amp;rsquo;s decision to cut funding for this live-saving research based on pseudo-scientific hysteria
condemns more people like my sister to death and more children to grow up without their mothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2025-08-11&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of ageism in tech.
One reason,
I think,
is that 30-year-olds spouting recycled Y Combinator bullshit
don&amp;rsquo;t like having the obvious flaws and contradictions in their statements pointed out
by people who&amp;rsquo;ve lived through two or three previous hype cycles.
Not hiring the elderly ensures that they&amp;rsquo;re always in a high-adulation environment,
and never have to worry about whether staff will resist being guilted or bullied into sacrificing their personal lives
for someone else&amp;rsquo;s gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2025-08-12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://andreas-zeller.info/&#34;&gt;Andreas Zeller&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s work is the most admirable example of software engineering research I know of.
Over several decades he and his team have done deep theoretical work &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; translated it into usable tools,
both to see if their ideas work in the real world and as a basis for dialog with developers about what problems to work on next.
(Go ahead, check out &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fuzzingbook.org/&#34;&gt;The Fuzzing Book&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.debuggingbook.org/&#34;&gt;The Debugging Book&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; —
you can thank me later.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I could go back 20 years and re-start my failed attempt to become a researcher myself,
I would try to do the same thing,
but would focus on developer productivity.
More specifically,
I would try to build deployable tools &lt;em&gt;that programmers would actually use&lt;/em&gt;
to find bottlenecks in real-world development processes,
while simultaneously doing the theoretical work needed to figure out
&amp;ldquo;what do we actually mean by &amp;lsquo;productivity&amp;rsquo; and how do we tell if someone&amp;rsquo;s productive or not?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of products in this space (Swarmia, Flow, etc.)
but I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen something that is
(a) open source,
(b) straightforward to deploy,
(c) actively being improved,
and (d) backed up by the kind of research that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drcathicks.com/&#34;&gt;Cat Hicks&lt;/a&gt;
and the contributors to &lt;a href=&#34;https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781484242209&#34;&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; do.
I think that if we had something like this today,
a lot of the debate about whether AI makes programmers more productive would have a much higher signal-to-noise ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2025-08-12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are using AI coding tools, please copy your prompt into the generated code as a comment (or have your agent do that):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You wrote a precise requirement spec - why throw it away?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;ll help the next person understand the code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s good context for the AI when you revise the code, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will help researchers who want to study these tools&amp;rsquo; accuracy and effectiveness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a good way to label code as &amp;ldquo;AI-generated&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;AI-assisted&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Workshops I Want</title>
   <link href="https://third-bit.com/2025/07/19/workshops-i-want/"/>
   <updated>2025-07-19T00:00:00Z</updated>
   <id>https://third-bit.com/2025/07/19/workshops-i-want/</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Following up on &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/2025/07/18/no-satisfaction/&#34;&gt;yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post&lt;/a&gt;,
here are some workshops I&amp;rsquo;d really like to take.
If you&amp;rsquo;re offering any of them,
please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experimental design and analysis for software engineers&lt;/strong&gt;
    who are trying to figure out how well their AI-based tools actually work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An introduction to the social sciences for programmers&lt;/strong&gt;
    who want to understand how power actually works in our society.
    (See &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/talks/sdgc/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sex and Drugs and Guns and Code&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for some thoughts.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distributed systems design by example&lt;/strong&gt;—basically,
    a sequel to &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Software Design by Example&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    in which learners build working models of distributed systems
    in order to understand how the real things work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Systems administration for data scientists&lt;/strong&gt;
    (or, what people who wrangle dataframes for a living need to know
    in order to deploy an application for others to use).
    This request is mostly professional curiosity:
    I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://gvwilson.github.io/sudonomicon/&#34;&gt;tried and failed&lt;/a&gt; to create this,
    and would like to see how others do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing research software projects&lt;/strong&gt;—not &amp;ldquo;how to use Git&amp;rdquo;
    but hiring and firing,
    marketing,
    budgeting,
    succession planning,
    and similar challenges.
    Again,
    I&amp;rsquo;ve also &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/mrsp/&#34;&gt;tried and failed to create this&lt;/a&gt;,
    so my interest here is partly professional curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organizational change for research software engineers&lt;/strong&gt;.
    We spend a lot of our time rolling rocks up hills;
    as I approach the end of my career,
    I&amp;rsquo;d really like someone to teach me how to get rid of the damn hills.
    &lt;em&gt;Note: we&amp;rsquo;re &lt;a href=&#34;https://gvwilson.github.io/change/&#34;&gt;working on this one&lt;/a&gt;;
    please reach out if you&amp;rsquo;d like to help.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a better world than this,
Canada would have a Natural Science and Engineering Education Council alongside NSERC
to fund the creation, dissemination, delivery, and evaluation of teaching and training materials.
Alas, that is not the timeline we&amp;rsquo;re in…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>No Satisfaction</title>
   <link href="https://third-bit.com/2025/07/18/no-satisfaction/"/>
   <updated>2025-07-18T00:00:00Z</updated>
   <id>https://third-bit.com/2025/07/18/no-satisfaction/</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t actually get much satisfaction from saying &amp;ldquo;I told you so&amp;rdquo;
because I only do it when the bad thing I was worried about has happened.
What motivates this observation is
the recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/&#34;&gt;METR paper&lt;/a&gt;
claiming that using AI lowers developers&amp;rsquo; productivity.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://bsky.app/profile/grimalkina.bsky.social/post/3ltpo634qc22l&#34;&gt;Cat Hicks&lt;/a&gt; and others
have done a better job of explaining the flaws in METR&amp;rsquo;s methodology than I possibly could.
What I want now is a workshop that teaches programmers
how to do trustworthy experiments on LLMs
and spot the mistakes in others&amp;rsquo; studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands and thousands of developers are trying to benchmark bots,
figure out if spicy autocomplete is making them more productive,
et endless cetera.
Most of those efforts are methodological and statistical dumpster fires;
while I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be cynical,
I think the same programmers who ignored &lt;a href=&#34;https://neverworkintheory.org/&#34;&gt;It Will Never Work in Theory&lt;/a&gt;
might pay attention to something with &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo; in its title.
Please,
someone,
save us from ourselves…&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Books For a Talk</title>
   <link href="https://third-bit.com/2025/07/16/books-for-a-talk/"/>
   <updated>2025-07-16T00:00:00Z</updated>
   <id>https://third-bit.com/2025/07/16/books-for-a-talk/</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m finally turning &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/ideas/sdgc/&#34;&gt;my proposal&lt;/a&gt; for a book titled
&lt;em&gt;Sex and Drugs and Guns and Code: What Everyone in Tech Needs to Know About Politics, Economics, Justice, and Power&lt;/em&gt;
into a talk.
The sources I plan to mention are listed below;
I&amp;rsquo;d be grateful for pointers to ones I&amp;rsquo;ve missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: my target audience is undergraduates in computer science and software engineering
who have never taken a class on politics, sociology, anthropology, or organizational behavior,
but dismiss those disciplines as &amp;ldquo;soft&amp;rdquo;.
If forced to wade through something dense and dull
they will dutifully parrot what they think they&amp;rsquo;re supposed to in order to get a grade,
but not change their view of the world in any substantial way.
In order to have impact,
this book must be engaging;
serious academics may therefore dismiss it as &amp;ldquo;light&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;shallow&amp;rdquo;,
but there&amp;rsquo;s no point being right if no one hears you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examples of humanist analyses in software engineering:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Petre: &lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2486788.2486883&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;UML in Practice&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; (2013)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steinmacher et al: &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1145/2675133.2675215&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Social Barriers Faced by Newcomers Placing Their First Contribution in Open Source Software Projects&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; (2015)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sedano et al: &lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icse.2017.20&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Software Development Waste&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; (2017)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hicks: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.catharsisinsight.com/reports&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s Like Coding in the Dark&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; (2022)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/2022/12/29/the-fourth-tradition/&#34;&gt;The Fourth Tradition&lt;/a&gt; for more background&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/2024/12/03/software-engineering-management-books/&#34;&gt;software engineering management books&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; talk about:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Labor rights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workplace discrimination: less than 8 pages between 12 books&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professional liability (or rather, why there isn&amp;rsquo;t any)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regulatory capture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Co-operatives and other organizational models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Books that are earnest but will put most programmers to sleep:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steen: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780367542436&#34;&gt;Ethics for People Who Work in Tech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (2022)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goltz &amp;amp; Dowdesell: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781032275055&#34;&gt;Real World AI Ethics for Data Scientists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (2023)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schlossberger: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781032151120&#34;&gt;Ethical Engineering: A Practical Guide with Case Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (2023)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wendorff: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781484273791&#34;&gt;Politics in Software Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;(2022)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Books that prove these topics can be interesting:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Levitt &amp;amp; Dubner: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780061234002&#34;&gt;Freakonomics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (2006)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preaches the neoliberal gospel that the only valid way to analyze individual behavior is maximization of wealth…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…which is provably wrong, but their writing is so engaging that this is possibly the most effective piece of propaganda in English in the last 30 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wainright: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781610397704&#34;&gt;Narconomics: How to Run a Drug Cartel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (2017)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turns out that marketing and HR are big challenges for crime syndicates…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…and you can learn a lot about how legitimate business works by looking at ones that ignore the legal system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to see a book comparing big tech to drug cartels&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big tech companies sell deliberately addictive products…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…treat the law as a business expense…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…and are frequently run by narcissists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raymond: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781565927247&#34;&gt;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (1999)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Popularized a compelling but misleading myth about the social organization of open source development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part of the point of &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; book is to get readers to the point where they understand why it was wrong &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; why it was popular&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bellotti: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781718501188&#34;&gt;Kill It With Fire: Manage Aging Computer Systems (and Future Proof Modern Ones)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (2021)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A critical but compassionate look at legacy systems, why they persist, and how to change them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Books that I think every software engineer should read (but know they won&amp;rsquo;t, hence the needed to summarize):&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Douglas: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780415289955&#34;&gt;Purity and Danger: An Analysis of Concepts of Pollution and Taboo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (2002)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Scott: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780300078152&#34;&gt;Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phillips Rozworski: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781786635167&#34;&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of Walmart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (2019)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Achen &amp;amp; Bartels: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780691178240&#34;&gt;Democracy for Realists: Why Elections Do Not Produce Responsive Government&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (2017)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;de Mesquita &amp;amp; Smith: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781541701366&#34;&gt;The Dictator&amp;rsquo;s Handbook: Why Bad Behavior is Almost Always Good Politics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (2022)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linklater: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781620402917&#34;&gt;Owning the Earth: The Transforming History of Land Ownership&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (2015)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bracha: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781108790697&#34;&gt;Owning Ideas: The Intellectual Origins of American Intellectual Property, 1790–1909&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (2019)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Igo: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780674244795&#34;&gt;The Known Citizen: A History of Privacy in Modern America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (2020)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most young programmers have only ever been exposed to one worldview:
the toxic strain of neoliberal capitalism favored by venture capitalists and their gushing fans in the tech media.
As inequality widens and racist nationalism makes a comeback,
as we do everything in our power to make climate change &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt;
while companies like X, Facebook, and Shopify tie themselves in knots to avoid responsibility for their actions,
most programmers don&amp;rsquo;t have the intellectual tools to understand what&amp;rsquo;s wrong and how we might fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of books give cogent answers to these questions,
but programmers who have never done a civics course
are not going to read nine thousand pages on a whim.
However,
they &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; sit through a one-semester course that explains why the human side of software engineering
is harder than the technical side.
This talk outlines what such a course might cover:
why &amp;ldquo;flat&amp;rdquo; organizations make power imbalances worse rather than better,
why discrimination persists despite its economic inefficiency,
how regulatory capture works,
why Americans keep shooting one another,
and what can we learn about big tech by studying drug cartels.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Some Testing Answers</title>
   <link href="https://third-bit.com/2025/05/19/some-testing-answers/"/>
   <updated>2025-05-19T00:00:00Z</updated>
   <id>https://third-bit.com/2025/05/19/some-testing-answers/</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A month ago I &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/2025/04/20/a-testing-question/&#34;&gt;asked for advice&lt;/a&gt; on testing a little piece of Python
that fills a grid using a random walk.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://stochasticsolutions.com/&#34;&gt;Nick Radcliffe&lt;/a&gt;,
a former colleague who is writing a book on test-driven data analysis,
suggested that one way to test the code is to put move generation in a function of its own,
call that function a few hundred times,
and check that the results are evenly distributed
(e.g., each of the four moves appears 20-30% of the time).
If not,
double the number of moves generated,
check again,
and repeat until either the distribution converges
or you decide that it&amp;rsquo;s not going to.
This approach ensures that tests run quickly most of the time,
and it did indeed catch a bug when I moved from 4-way steps to 8-way (i.e., allowed diagonal moves).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nathanfurnal.xyz/&#34;&gt;Nathan Furnal&lt;/a&gt; suggested a similar approach.
If we generate 30 moves,
the probability of never seeing one of the four possible moves is less than 0.02%.
If we increase the number of moves to 100 (which only takes 61 microseconds on my five-year-old laptop)
the odds of not seeing one of the moves drop to one in 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;.
If we&amp;rsquo;re running the tests 1000 times a day,
we can expect one false positive every ten million years or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve added both tests to my test suite,
but would appreciate suggestions for others.
Testing in the face of randomness is more common and more important in (data) science
than in commercial software development;
as more and more applications incorporate small household spirits (i.e., genAI),
we&amp;rsquo;re going to have to figure out how to do this well.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Two Thirds of a Language</title>
   <link href="https://third-bit.com/2025/05/18/two-thirds-of-a-language/"/>
   <updated>2025-05-18T00:00:00Z</updated>
   <id>https://third-bit.com/2025/05/18/two-thirds-of-a-language/</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Inspired in part by posts online about this year&amp;rsquo;s PyCon,
I started to wonder how much of the language I actually use.
To answer the question,
I counted how many different types of nodes are provided by &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html&#34;&gt;Python&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;ast&lt;/code&gt; module&lt;/a&gt;
and how many of those show up in the code I wrote for
&lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Software Design by Example&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
The answer appears to be 60%,
i.e.,
I use a bit less than two-thirds of what Python 3.12 offers.
Other measures would give other answers—for example,
I expect that I use much, much less than 60% of Python&amp;rsquo;s standard library—but still,
it&amp;rsquo;s kind of interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope everyone&amp;rsquo;s having fun in Pittsburgh…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;ast&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;pathlib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Path&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ast_dict&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;getattr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ow&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;

   <title>We Weren&#39;t Ready for the Flood</title>
   <link href="https://third-bit.com/2025/05/01/we-werent-ready-for-the-flood/"/>
   <updated>2025-05-01T00:00:00Z</updated>
   <id>https://third-bit.com/2025/05/01/we-werent-ready-for-the-flood/</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the end I decided not to go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2025&#34;&gt;ICSE 2025&lt;/a&gt; in Ottawa.
I would have enjoyed catching up with friends
and having coffee with people I&amp;rsquo;ve only ever chatted to online,
but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t justify the time and expense.
I also didn&amp;rsquo;t know what I could say that people wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have grown tired of hearing:
as &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/2020/07/09/acm-sigsoft-award/&#34;&gt;I wrote in 2020&lt;/a&gt;,
I&amp;rsquo;ve had no impact on software engineering research or education despite years of trying,
and I think people have grown weary of my jeremiads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; gone,
though,
here&amp;rsquo;s what I would have said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been studying software engineers and software engineering for over fifty years.
Despite that,
we still don&amp;rsquo;t have an agreed-upon way to measure developers&amp;rsquo; productivity,
which means we can&amp;rsquo;t answer the question,
&amp;ldquo;Is AI helping or not?&amp;rdquo;
And we still don&amp;rsquo;t teach empirical software engineering to undergraduates,
which means that most programmers don&amp;rsquo;t know enough to know that
most of the answers they&amp;rsquo;re seeing and hearing aren&amp;rsquo;t just wrong,
they&amp;rsquo;re nonsensical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flood came and we weren&amp;rsquo;t ready;
I wish I believed that we would be for the next one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why yes, I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have a suggestion about how to get ready:
turn &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-4221-6&#34;&gt;Rethinking Productivity in Software Engineering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
into an undergraduate course
that teaches students the methods used to answer questions like this,
how to use those methods themselves,
and how to tell good science from splackulent crap
like the &amp;ldquo;ghost engineers&amp;rdquo; screed that got so much attention in late 2024.
I realize data science no longer makes university administrators salivate the way it did a few years ago,
but if you call the course &amp;ldquo;Data Science for Software Engineers&amp;rdquo;
you&amp;rsquo;re bound to get a few takers.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
