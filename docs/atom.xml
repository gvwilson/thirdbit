   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;All right, you&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/2025/01/07/forming-teams/&#34;&gt;formed a team&lt;/a&gt;:
now what?
How do you decide who does what?
How do you make sure that everyone actually does what they&amp;rsquo;re supposed to?
And most importantly, how do you do this fairly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some jobs have higher social status than others,
and what is or isn&amp;rsquo;t considered important
usually reflects racial and gender divides within society—so much so that
sociologists use the phrase &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_work&#34;&gt;women&amp;rsquo;s work&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; to describe the phenomenon.
It is also known as &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_issues_faced_by_black_quarterbacks&#34;&gt;quarterback syndrome&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;:
two thirds of NFL players overall in the United States are Black,
but only 17% of quarterbacks,
which is the position on a team with the highest social status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among programmers,
writing operating systems or other software that is close to the hardware
has higher status than building user interfaces;
people doing the former are both paid more and more likely to be male
than people doing the latter,
regardless of ability or value delivered to the employer.
This creates a feedback loop:
white and Asian men pursue certain career paths because they have high status
(they want to be &amp;ldquo;real programmers&amp;rdquo;),
and the fact that they are pursuing those careers is what maintains their higher status.
It also creates a confirmation loop:
since women and people of color get fewer chances to do certain tasks,
they are less good at them,
which &amp;ldquo;confirms&amp;rdquo; the initial bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this starts in the classroom.
In mixed-gender teams,
for example,
female students are more likely to be given responsibility for taking notes,
writing documentation,
and other low-status tasks.
Some have experienced this so often that they have come to accept it as
the price they have to pay for being in tech.
Others protest, but those who do are often dismissed as being &amp;ldquo;difficult&amp;rdquo;.
Many take a third path and decide to leave programming—after all,
why play a game that&amp;rsquo;s unfair?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;callout&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the beginning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming was originally considered a female occupation,
but as it became more lucrative it came to be viewed as &amp;ldquo;naturally&amp;rdquo; male.
[&lt;a href=&#34;https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780262534536&#34;&gt;Abbate2012&lt;/a&gt;] and [&lt;a href=&#34;https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780262517966&#34;&gt;Ensmenger2012&lt;/a&gt;] describe how this happened,
while [&lt;a href=&#34;https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780262535182&#34;&gt;Hicks2018&lt;/a&gt;] looks at how Britain lost its early dominance in computing
by systematically discriminating against its most qualified workers:
women.
Some men become quite uncomfortable whenever this is brought up,
but we need to learn how to discuss our own history
if we want to be able to think clearly about how the things we&amp;rsquo;re doing today
might change society tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to divide project work between team members,
but no matter how you do it,
the software you get will reflect the division of labor
(a phenomenon known as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway&#39;s_law&#34;&gt;Conway&amp;rsquo;s Law&lt;/a&gt;
or socio-technical congruence [&lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1414004.1414008&#34;&gt;Cataldo2008&lt;/a&gt;]).
In a &lt;em&gt;modular decomposition&lt;/em&gt;,
each person is responsible for one part of the program.
For example,
one person might design and build the GUI
while another writes the database interface
and a third implements the business rules.
Having people own parts of the code like this produces lower failure rates in industry [&lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2025113.2025119&#34;&gt;Bird2011&lt;/a&gt;],
but is generally a bad strategy in a course project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It leads to &lt;em&gt;big bang integration&lt;/em&gt;
    in which all the components meet each other for the first time
    right at the end of the project.
    Big bang almost always fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each team member only really understands one aspect of the project,
    which often proves fragile.
    (Imagine what happens if someone gets sick or drops the course…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It increases the risk of people from marginalized groups being assigned lower-status work,
    since self-appointed alpha geeks will usually snag jobs like architecture and coding,
    leaving less appealing work to people who aren&amp;rsquo;t as pushy, privileged, or self-confident.
    This tends to reinforce existing inequities;
    it also tends to lower the team&amp;rsquo;s overall grade,
    since there&amp;rsquo;s often little relationship between how outspoken people are
    and how well they work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;functional decomposition&lt;/em&gt;,
each person is responsible for one type of task,
i.e.,
one person does the testing,
another handles the documentation,
a third does the bulk of the coding,
and the fourth takes care of build and deployment.
This strategy has the same drawbacks as modular decomposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I therefore recommend that student teams use &lt;em&gt;feature decomposition&lt;/em&gt;:
instead of owning an entire subsystem for the life of the project,
each team member handles the design, coding, testing, and documentation of one feature.
There isn&amp;rsquo;t as much need for close collaboration between students
as there is with the previous two strategies,
but feature decomposition is more robust and more equitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any of these strategies is better than &lt;em&gt;chaotic decomposition&lt;/em&gt;,
which unfortunately is the most common approach.
If people have different ideas about who&amp;rsquo;s supposed to do what,
some things won&amp;rsquo;t be done at all while others will be done several times over.
(You can tell if your decomposition is chaotic by counting how often people say,
&amp;ldquo;I thought &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; were doing that!&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;But I&amp;rsquo;ve already done that!&amp;rdquo;)
All other decompositions tend toward chaos under pressure,
so it&amp;rsquo;s important to establish rules early
and stick to them when the going is easy
so that the instinct to do the right thing will be there
when mid-terms other deadlines strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;callout&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how you allocate work, make sure that everyone understands who is doing what, when.
As [&lt;a href=&#34;https://peerj.com/articles/cs-241/&#34;&gt;Barke2019&lt;/a&gt;] found,
actual roles can be fluid;
what matters most is that team members understand and accept their responsibilities
and everyone else&amp;rsquo;s at any particular moment.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Forming Teams</title>
   <link href="https://third-bit.com/2025/01/07/forming-teams/"/>
   <updated>2025-01-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
   <id>https://third-bit.com/2025/01/07/forming-teams/</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Most people learn better together than they do on their own [&lt;a href=&#34;https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781579220860&#34;&gt;Michaelson2004&lt;/a&gt;].
As long as their teams work well they achieve higher grades,
retain information longer,
are less likely to drop out of school,
and graduate with better communication skills
and a better understanding of what will be expected of them in their subsequent careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that &amp;ldquo;as long as&amp;rdquo; is important.
A badly-run team is worse than no team at all,
since people will waste hours or days arguing with one another,
duplicating or undoing each other&amp;rsquo;s work,
and wishing that they had gone into gardening instead.
These conflicts are more wearying than any number of buffer overruns or accidentally erased files,
which is why most computer science courses stick to individual assignments.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t take much to make a team work smoothly, though.
The rules for running meetings &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/2025/01/04/meetings/&#34;&gt;posted earlier&lt;/a&gt; are a good start;
this post looks at a few other things you can do,
and [&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ijee.ie/1atestissues/Vol35-6B/05_ijee3838.pdf&#34;&gt;Parker2019&lt;/a&gt;] goes into more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;callout&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team size&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once heard an anthropologist ask, &amp;ldquo;How big is a sports team?&amp;rdquo;
When people said it depends on the sport,
she explained that in fact they all have about half a dozen members.
Anything larger than that splits into smaller groups:
the forwards and backs in rugby,
the infield and outfield in baseball,
and so on.
She went on to explain that hunting parties in non-agricultural societies are usually that size as well,
as are basic military units around the world
(a platoon is two squads of six people).
Since we can only keep a handful of things in our short-term memory at once,
that&amp;rsquo;s as big as a team can practically be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same rule applies to software development.
Three or four people can work tightly on a single piece of code,
but when there are more they define some interfaces and develop in parallel.
Tools like GitHub help groups coordinate more effectively,
but the groups themselves stay the same size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams of three to five provide a good balance between skills and accountability.
A team of two may not have enough breadth and background to tackle a large piece of work;
more importantly,
one or the other person is likely to take a dominant role.
If you put six or eight people in a team,
on the other hand,
you may not be able to divide up the work
in a way that will keep everyone engaged and busy.
Teams that size or larger also make scheduling meetings much more difficult
and increase the odds that at least one member will be a hitchhiker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many students prefer to select their teammates,
and students with high grades tend to want teammates with a similar profile.
[&lt;a href=&#34;https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/josotl/article/view/24128&#34;&gt;Post2020&lt;/a&gt;] found that matching students by grade led to a small improvement in outcomes,
with a larger impact on team grades than on individual ones.
he same study found that members of self-selected teams
were more likely to already have friends on their team,
but that this was &lt;em&gt;negatively&lt;/em&gt; correlated with outcomes
(possibly because people are less willing to hold friends accountable for missed work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One surprising finding is that having students with a range of grades in the same team
either has no effect or improves outcomes for everyone
[&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lifescied.org/doi/10.1187/cbe.17-12-0283&#34;&gt;Donovan2018&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&#34;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002945923015395&#34;&gt;Farland2019&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&#34;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9274203&#34;&gt;Auvinen2020&lt;/a&gt;].
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see how this benefits teams of weak students:
they are likely to get coaching from their stronger teammates.
One theory for why it also helps stronger students is that
the best way to learn something is to explain it to someone else;
bringing a weaker teammate up to speed will usually do more for your grade
than spending those same hours hacking or reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience,
teams of strong students are also more likely to use a divide and conquer strategy,
effectively reducing the project to a set of parallel sub-projects handled by one person each.
This may feel more efficient,
but most of the benefits of working in a team are lost:
there&amp;rsquo;s less back-and-forth discussion of design issues
and little improvement in communication skills.
Those may not be important to you at first,
but if there is a final exam in your course with questions about the project work,
your mark on it may depend on how much you know about your teammates&amp;rsquo; work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most powerful argument for instructors selecting teams,
though,
is that&amp;rsquo;s how it works in the real world.
You probably won&amp;rsquo;t get to pick your colleagues if you join a company or an academic research group.
Instead, you&amp;rsquo;ll be put on a project and expected to work well with whoever else is on it.
Your performance will depend as much on your ability to get along with others
as it will on your raw technical ability,
so you might as well start practicing those skills now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If instructors create teams,
they should avoid isolating at-risk students.
Women and members of racial minority groups are more likely to drop out of computer science than other students,
particularly in first and second year,
and one of the main reasons is feeling isolated or out of place.
Research has shown that putting at-risk students together in the first couple of years can mitigate this problem
[&lt;a href=&#34;https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780262632690&#34;&gt;Margolis2002&lt;/a&gt;].
t is less necessary in upper years,
since by then students have a stronger commitment to whatever program they&amp;rsquo;re in,
but it still helps to prevent some of the problems discussed in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest headache when instructors select teams is scheduling.
COVID-19 has made distributed work more normal,
but the University of Toronto has three campuses spread across a large metropolitan area,
which means some students commute an hour and a half each way to get to classes.
Instructors should therefore take students&amp;rsquo; schedules into account when forming teams.
If the class is small,
the simplest way is to get each student to fill in a weekly timesheet showing when they&amp;rsquo;re available
and then group people who have large blocks of overlap.
If the class is larger,
a web-based calendaring tool may be easier.
Instructors can even try to use whatever software the university uses to figure out course timetables,
although that usually doesn&amp;rsquo;t scale down to in-class scheduling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another factor to take into account is that some people are naturally early birds while others are night owls.
Putting the two on the same team pretty much guarantees that someone will miss meetings
or sleep through them
no matter when they&amp;rsquo;re held.
Simply asking people, &amp;ldquo;Do you prefer to work in the morning, or the evening?&amp;rdquo;
can be surprisingly effective [&lt;a href=&#34;http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01752v1&#34;&gt;Zavgorodniaia2021&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However people are put together,
each team should have at least one block of two hours to work together each week outside of class.
Teams should also try to find a second block that&amp;rsquo;s half an hour long for a weekly meeting.
Try to keep the two blocks separate
so that it&amp;rsquo;s clear to everyone when they&amp;rsquo;re supposed to be talking about the project
and when they&amp;rsquo;re supposed to be doing design, writing code, testing, and so on.
If the two are scheduled back-to-back,
the meeting will drag on into working time or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Making Decisions</title>
   <link href="https://third-bit.com/2025/01/06/making-decisions/"/>
   <updated>2025-01-06T00:00:00Z</updated>
   <id>https://third-bit.com/2025/01/06/making-decisions/</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The first release of GitHub&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/github/MVG&#34;&gt;Minimum Viable Governance&lt;/a&gt; guidelines
included this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;callout&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.1. Consensus-Based Decision Making&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects make decisions through consensus of the Maintainers.
While explicit agreement of all Maintainers is preferred,
it is not required for consensus.
Rather,
the Maintainers will determine consensus based on their good faith consideration of a number of factors,
including the dominant view of the Contributors and nature of support and objections.
The Maintainers will document evidence of consensus in accordance with these requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds reasonable,
but it&amp;rsquo;s wrong-headed.
Every team has a power structure:
the question is whether it&amp;rsquo;s formal or informal—in other words,
whether it&amp;rsquo;s accountable or unaccountable [&lt;a href=&#34;https://muse.jhu.edu/article/528558&#34;&gt;Freeman2013&lt;/a&gt;].
In the latter case,
decisions will effectively be made by the people
who are the most self-confident or stubborn
rather than by those with the most insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To guard against this,
groups need to spell out who has the authority to make which decisions
and how to achieve consensus.
In short,
they need explicit governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martha&amp;rsquo;s Rules [&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1177/088610998600100206&#34;&gt;Minahan1986&lt;/a&gt;]
are a practical way to do this in groups of up to a few dozen people,
and work very well for smaller teams too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before each meeting, anyone who wishes may sponsor a proposal.
    Proposals must be filed at least 24 hours before a meeting in order to be considered,
    and must include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a one-line summary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the full text of the proposal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any required background information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pros and cons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;possible alternatives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quorum is established in a meeting if half or more of voting members are present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a person has sponsored a proposal,
    the group may not discuss or vote on the issue
    unless the sponsor or their delegate is present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the sponsor presents the proposal a &lt;em&gt;sense vote&lt;/em&gt; is cast:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thumbs up: who likes the proposal?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thumbs down: who is uncomfortable with the proposal?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thumbs sideways: who can live with?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If everyone likes or can live with the proposal,
    it passes with no further discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the majority is uncomfortable with the proposal,
    it is sent back to its sponsor for further work.
    (The sponsor may decide to drop it if it&amp;rsquo;s clear the majority isn&amp;rsquo;t ever going to support it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise,
    the group has a brief moderated discussion.
    After 10 minutes,
    or when no one has anything further to add,
    the moderator calls for a straight yes-or-no vote on the proposal.
    If a majority votes &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; it is adopted;
    otherwise,
    it is returned to the sponsor for further work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every group that uses Martha&amp;rsquo;s Rules must make two procedural decisions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;How are proposals put forward?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The easiest way to do this in a software project
is to file an issue in the project&amp;rsquo;s issue tracker
tagged &lt;code&gt;proposal&lt;/code&gt;.
Team members can comment on it there
so that the sponsor can revise it before bringing it to a vote.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Who gets to vote?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;In a course project the answer is &amp;ldquo;whoever is part of the team,&amp;rdquo;
but a more explicit rule is needed for larger or longer-lived projects.
One method is for existing members to nominate new ones,
and for the team to hold a straight yes-or-no vote on each.
Another is to automatically include anyone whose changes to the code
were accepted by existing members,
though this under-values non-programming contributions
like doing code reviews
or testing new releases.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rules that people don&amp;rsquo;t know about can&amp;rsquo;t help them.
Once your team agrees on a decision-making procedure,
document it for newcomers
(and to prevent disputes among people already in the team).
You can put this in the project&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;README&lt;/code&gt; file
or in a separate file called &lt;code&gt;CONTRIBUTING&lt;/code&gt;.
Wherever it goes,
remember that the easier it is for people to figure out how to contribute,
the more likely they are to do so [&lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2593702.2593704&#34;&gt;Steinmacher2014&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nothing about us without us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules laid out above were created
by and for people near the middle of the bell curve with respect to focus and attention span.
People who are neurodivergent
(i.e., whose brains work differently from the average
when it comes to sociability, learning, attention, and mood)
may find that other approaches work better for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while society accepts that
people of different heights need different desks and seating to be comfortable,
there is still a lot of stigma
associated with differences in mental function,
which are often classified according to how inconvenient they are to other people.
One example is how tests for
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are phrased.
&amp;ldquo;Subject is overly talkative&amp;rdquo;: compared to who?
&amp;ldquo;Subject does X when it is inappropriate&amp;rdquo;: by whose rules?
&amp;ldquo;Struggles to pay attention&amp;rdquo;: in fact,
most people with ADHD can pay very close attention,
but not when they are in environments like noisy classrooms
that are full of distractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decisions that affect people should only be made
with the full participation of those who will be affected.
If you are neurodivergent,
you probably have a set of strategies for managing time and attention.
If you are neurotypical and have neurodivergent teammates,
ask them what works well for them rather than ignoring the difference
or guessing what they might want.
Please do the same if you have teammates who have difficulty seeing, hearing, or moving about:
they have expertise you don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Air Time</title>
   <link href="https://third-bit.com/2025/01/05/air-time/"/>
   <updated>2025-01-05T00:00:00Z</updated>
   <id>https://third-bit.com/2025/01/05/air-time/</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One problem with &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/2025/01/04/meetings/&#34;&gt;meetings&lt;/a&gt; is that
some people may talk far more than others.
Other people may be so accustomed to this
that they don&amp;rsquo;t speak up even when they have valuable points to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can combat this
by giving everyone three sticky notes at the start of the meeting
(or coins, or paperclips—anything inedible will do).
Every time someone speaks,
they have to give up one sticky note.
When they&amp;rsquo;re out of stickies,
they aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to speak until everyone has used at least one,
at which point everyone gets all of their sticky notes back.
This ensures that nobody talks more than three times as often as
the quietest person in the room,
which completely changes group dynamics.
People who have given up trying to be heard suddenly have space to contribute,
while the overly-frequent speakers realize how talkative they have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;callout&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning the hard way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first encountered this technique when someone on my team used it on me.
No matter how many people were in the room,
I seemed to think I should be talking half the time;
I still do that sometimes,
but I&amp;rsquo;d like think I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another useful technique is called interruption bingo.
Draw a grid and label the rows and columns with the participants&amp;rsquo; names;
each time person A interrupts person B,
add a tally mark to the appropriate cell.
Look at the results Halfway through the meeting:
in most cases it will be clear that one or two people are doing all of the interrupting,
and that they&amp;rsquo;re always interrupting the same people.
After that,
saying, &amp;ldquo;All right, I&amp;rsquo;m adding another tally to the bingo card,&amp;rdquo;
is usually enough to get them to throttle back.
If it isn&amp;rsquo;t,
well,
you just learned something about your teammate…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;callout&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unevenly distributed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing interruption bingo often reveals is that
people who interrupt
almost always interrupt down,
i.e.,
they only interrupt people they believe have lower social status than they do.
People who do this also often use interruption to establish social status:
if I can cut you off mid-sentence,
I must be more important than you are.
In the worst case two people will waste everyone else&amp;rsquo;s time trying to out-interrupt each other,
which a colleague of mine used to refer to as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lek_mating&#34;&gt;lekking&lt;/a&gt;.
Please don&amp;rsquo;t do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online meetings provide special challenges for regulating how often individuals speak.
[&lt;a href=&#34;https://chelseatroy.com/2018/03/29/why-do-remote-meetings-suck-so-much/&#34;&gt;Troy2018&lt;/a&gt;] discusses why online meetings
are often frustrating,
and points out that in most online meetings,
the first person to speak during a pause gets the floor.
As a result,
&amp;ldquo;If you have something you want to say,
you have to stop listening to the person currently speaking
and instead focus on when they&amp;rsquo;re gonna pause or finish
so you can leap into that nanosecond of silence
and be the first to utter something.
The format…encourages participants who want to contribute to say more and listen less.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is to run a text chat beside the video conference
where people can signal that they want to speak;
the moderator can then select people from the waiting list.
Text chat is better than the &amp;ldquo;raise hand&amp;rdquo; feature most video conferencing tools offer
because the person who wants to speak can indicate why.
For example,
they can type &amp;ldquo;question about budget&amp;rdquo;
rather than just &amp;ldquo;question&amp;rdquo;
so that the moderator can group related questions together.
Again, [&lt;a href=&#34;https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781119049715&#34;&gt;Brookfield2016&lt;/a&gt;] is a useful, well-organized catalog of techniques like these.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <link href="https://third-bit.com/2025/01/04/meetings/"/>
   <updated>2025-01-04T00:00:00Z</updated>
   <id>https://third-bit.com/2025/01/04/meetings/</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/2025/01/03/time-management/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; explained how to be productive individually,
but what about being productive with others?
The most important thing is running meetings efficiently,
and the key to doing that is to distinguish between:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Status meetings
    for keeping everyone up to date on what everyone else is doing
    and for making simple decisions when the options are well understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussion meetings
    for weighing alternatives and making complex decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-working sessions like brainstorming sessions and programming sprints
    that are devoted to the content of the project rather than its operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Status Meetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every team should have a short weekly status meeting.
One way to organize these is
to create a table in a shared document like the one below.
Everyone adds a few bullet points to their row in the table
at least half an hour before the meeting starts
so that the whole team can mull everything over.
If anyone wants to discuss something,
they highlight it by adding a comment.
The meeting moderator then goes through the highlighted items one by one,
spending no more than a couple of minutes on each;
anything that requires more time is deferred to a discussion meeting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Person&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Progress&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Plans&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Problems&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ren&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Parsing OCTL records&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tag OCTL records in DVC&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Duplicate OCTL tags?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Deployed progress bar patch&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Help onboard Silvia&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mikka&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Refactored PostgreSQL connector&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;#156: handle records with NULL timestamp&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Clarify authorship guidelines&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Patched database tests&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;#171: auto-archive duplicate records&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sanjay&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Jess&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to run a status meeting is to review issues that people have closed in the past week
or are actively working on.
&amp;ldquo;Actively&amp;rdquo; is the key word here,
and in my experience,
this method only works if someone is responsible for handling issue triage before each meeting.
The biggest advantage of using issues is that there&amp;rsquo;s no extra work;
the disadvantage is that there&amp;rsquo;s no record later on of what people were doing at any particular time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Decision Meetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decision meetings are for issues that will have more long-term impact on the project
or that team members disagree about.
Since the stakes are higher,
they need more structure.
(See &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtewOjRy-1U&#34;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; for a long version of the rules below.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Decide if there actually needs to be a meeting.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;If the only purpose is to share information,
send a brief email instead:
most people can read faster than they can speak.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Write an agenda.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;If nobody cares enough about the meeting to prepare
a point-form list of what&amp;rsquo;s to be discussed,
the meeting probably doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to happen.
(Note that &amp;ldquo;the agenda is all the open issues in our GitHub repo&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t count.)&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Include timings in the agenda.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Doing this helps prevent early items stealing time from later ones.
The first estimates with any new group are inevitably optimistic,
so expect to revise them upward for subsequent meetings.
But don&amp;rsquo;t have second or third
meeting just because the first one ran over time: instead, try to figure out
&lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it ran over and fix the underlying problem.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Select a moderator.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Put one person in charge of keeping items on time,
selecting the next person to speak,
chiding people who are having side conversations or checking email,
and asking people who are talking too much to get to the point.
The moderator should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; do all the talking:
in fact,
the moderator will talk less in a well-run meeting than most other participants.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Prioritize.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Tackle the most important issues first, even if they&amp;rsquo;re the longest,
because the little ones always take more time than you expect.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Require politeness.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;No one gets to be rude,
no one gets to ramble,
and if someone goes off topic,
it&amp;rsquo;s the moderator&amp;rsquo;s job to say, &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s discuss that elsewhere.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;No interruptions.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This rule is a special case of the one above,
since treating other people with respect is the sincerest form of politeness.
Participants should raise a hand (physically or electronically)
when they want to speak.
The moderator should keep track of the queue
and give each person time in turn.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;No distractions.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Side conversations make meetings less efficient
because nobody can actually pay attention to two things at once.
More importantly,
if someone is checking their email or texting a friend during a meeting,
it&amp;rsquo;s a clear signal that they don&amp;rsquo;t think the speaker or their work is important.
This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean a complete ban on technology—people may need accessibility aids
or be waiting for a call about childcare—but by default
phones should be face down and laptops should be closed
during in-person meetings.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Take minutes.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;As discussed below,
someone other than the moderator should take
point-form notes
about the most important information that was shared
and about every decision that was made or every task that was assigned to someone.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;End early.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;If the meeting is scheduled for 10:00–11:00,
aim to end at 10:50 to give people a break before whatever they&amp;rsquo;re doing next.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as the meeting is over,
add the minutes to the project&amp;rsquo;s wiki,
version control repository,
or shared cloud drive.
Please don&amp;rsquo;t email minutes to everyone:
our inboxes are full enough,
and the more places new team members need to search in order to find things,
the more likely they are to miss something important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing the minutes ensures that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;People who weren&amp;rsquo;t at the meeting can follow what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;We all have to juggle tasks from several projects or courses,
which means that sometimes we can&amp;rsquo;t make it to meetings.
Checking a shared record is more accurate and more efficient than asking a colleague,
&amp;ldquo;What did I miss?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Everyone can check what was actually said or promised.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Accidentally or not, people often remember things differently;
writing them down gives everyone a chance to correct mistakes
and misinterpretations.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;People can be held accountable.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Whoever has to draw up the agenda for the next meeting
can start with the action items from the previous one.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to become better at sharing information and making decisions,
there is no better place to start than [&lt;a href=&#34;https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781119049715&#34;&gt;Brookfield2016&lt;/a&gt;],
which catalogs fifty different techniques for managing discussions
and explains when and how each is useful.&lt;/p&gt;

has useful labels and even more useful advice

   <title>Time Management</title>
   <link href="https://third-bit.com/2025/01/03/time-management/"/>
   <updated>2025-01-03T00:00:00Z</updated>
   <id>https://third-bit.com/2025/01/03/time-management/</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/2025/01/02/crunch-mode/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; explained why people are most productive
when they work at a steady pace and get lots of rest,
and [&lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1584322.1584325&#34;&gt;Edwards2009&lt;/a&gt;] found that
starting assignments early and working consistently predicted good grades.
However,
while people in industry joke that having two bosses means living in hell,
students usually answer to four or five professors
whom don&amp;rsquo;t coordinate due dates across their courses.
I remember a week where I had two major assignments due,
two mid-terms to write,
and a bad cold;
what can you do when this happens to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best solution—or more honestly, the least bad—is to prioritize carefully.
Get a piece of paper and draw a 3×3 grid.
The X axis is effort: label its divisions &amp;ldquo;minutes&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;hours&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;days&amp;rdquo;.
The Y axis is time: label it &amp;ldquo;low&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;medium&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;high&amp;rdquo;.
You should wind up with something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://third-bit.com/files/2025/effort-importance.svg&#34; alt=&#34;effort-importance grid&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next,
put everything you need to do somewhere on the grid,
and then throw away the high-effort, low-importance items in the bottom right—you
aren&amp;rsquo;t going to get to those.
You can then start assembling the other items into a schedule,
starting with the upper-left corner.
These are the things that will give the highest return on invested time;
more importantly,
starting with these means that if you&amp;rsquo;ve under-estimated effort,
you will still deliver &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tricky items are the ones on the diagonal.
Should you tackle one thing that is high effort and high importance
or three things that are individually less important
but require the same total effort?
Laying things out on a grid can&amp;rsquo;t answer that question,
but at least it can tell you what the question is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;callout&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to prioritize:
always finish first the tasks that will allow other people to continue/start/finish their work.
&lt;br&gt;
— &lt;a href=&#34;https://yabellini.netlify.app/&#34;&gt;Yanina Bellini Saibene&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any task on your list is more than an hour long,
break it down into smaller pieces and prioritize those separately.
Figuring out what those pieces are can take time,
so don&amp;rsquo;t be embarrassed to make &amp;ldquo;plan XYZ&amp;rdquo; a task in its own right.
And remember that the future is approaching at a rate of 24 hours per day:
if something is going to take thirty hours to finish,
you had better allow at least five working days for it,
which means you&amp;rsquo;d better start at least that far ahead of the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of all this organization and preparation is
to be able to immerse yourself in your problem.
[&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.harpercollins.com/products/flow-mihaly-csikszentmihalyi&#34;&gt;Csikszentmihalyi1991&lt;/a&gt;] popularized the term flow for this;
athletes call it &amp;ldquo;being in the zone&amp;rdquo;,
while musicians talk about losing themselves in what they&amp;rsquo;re playing.
The good news is that you&amp;rsquo;re much more productive in this state
than when you&amp;rsquo;re multi-tasking.
The bad news is that
it takes anywhere from several seconds to several minutes
to get back into this state after an interruption [&lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11219-010-9104-9&#34;&gt;Parnin2010&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2702123.2702156&#34;&gt;Borst2015&lt;/a&gt;].
In other words,
if you are interrupted half a dozen times per hour
you are &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; at your productive peak.
Ironically,
the cost of self-interruptions may be even worse than the cost for external interruptions [&lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3210459.3210471&#34;&gt;Abad2018&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;callout&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open offices suck&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open offices were created
so that (mostly male) managers could keep an eye on (mostly female) office workers,
and to reduce air conditioning costs [&lt;a href=&#34;https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780140169126&#34;&gt;Eley1995&lt;/a&gt;].
They lower productivity in every other way we can measure [&lt;a href=&#34;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2017.0239&#34;&gt;Bernstein2018&lt;/a&gt;];
sadly,
the same is true of other interruption-rich environments
like your favorite coffee shop.
If you really want to be productive,
you should avoid both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally,
you will be more productive in the long run if your back doesn&amp;rsquo;t ache,
and being away from the keyboard
gives your brain a chance to reflect on what you&amp;rsquo;ve just been doing.
You should therefore take a five-minute break every hour.
Checking email doesn&amp;rsquo;t count:
get up and stretch,
refill your water bottle,
or go and restack the dishwasher.
You&amp;rsquo;ll be amazed at how often you can solve a problem that&amp;rsquo;s been baffling you for an hour
by taking a short walk.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Crunch Mode</title>
   <link href="https://third-bit.com/2025/01/02/crunch-mode/"/>
   <updated>2025-01-02T00:00:00Z</updated>
   <id>https://third-bit.com/2025/01/02/crunch-mode/</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m supervising some undergraduate students at the University of Toronto this semester.
It&amp;rsquo;s the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve done this in almost 15 years,
and it&amp;rsquo;s giving me a chance to re-think and re-write the advice I used to give
when I was doing this regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;callout&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My starting point is [&lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icse.2017.20&#34;&gt;Sedano2017&lt;/a&gt;],
which found that software development projects have nine types of waste:
building the wrong feature or product,
mismanaging the backlog,
rework,
unnecessarily complex solutions,
extraneous cognitive load,
psychological distress,
waiting and multitasking,
knowledge loss,
and ineffective communication.
&lt;em&gt;None of these are software issues,&lt;/em&gt;
so if you only think about the code in your project and not about the people writing it,
everything will take longer and hurt more than it needs to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to brag about the hours I was working.
Not in so many words, of course—I had &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; social skills—but
I&amp;rsquo;d show up for work around noon,
unshaven and yawning,
and casually mention how I&amp;rsquo;d been up until 6:00 a.m. working on some monster bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back,
I can&amp;rsquo;t remember who I was trying to impress.
Instead,
what I remember is how much of the code I wrote in those all-nighters I threw away
once I&amp;rsquo;d had some sleep.
My mistake was to confuse &amp;ldquo;long hours&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;getting things done&amp;rdquo;.
You can&amp;rsquo;t produce software (or anything else) without doing some work,
but you can easily do lots of work without producing anything of value.
Scientific study of overwork goes back to at least the 1890s—see
[&lt;a href=&#34;https://igda.org/resources-archive/why-crunch-mode-doesnt-work-six-lessons-2005/&#34;&gt;Robinson2005&lt;/a&gt;] for a short, readable summary.
The most important results are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working more than eight hours a day for more than a couple of weeks of time
    lowers your total productivity,
    not just your hourly productivity—i.e., you get less done &lt;em&gt;in total&lt;/em&gt; in crunch mode
    than when you work regular hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working over 21 hours in a stretch
    increases the odds of you making a catastrophic error
    just as much as being legally drunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These facts have been verified through hundreds of experiments
over the course of more than a century,
including some on novice software developers [&lt;a href=&#34;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8357494&#34;&gt;Fucci2020&lt;/a&gt;].
The data behind them is as solid as the data linking smoking to lung cancer.
However,
while most smokers will at least acknowledge that their habit is killing them,
people in the software industry still talk and act as if
they were somehow immune to science.
To quote Robinson&amp;rsquo;s article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;callout&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Henry Ford famously adopted a 40-hour workweek in 1926,
he was bitterly criticized by members of the National Association of Manufacturers.
But his experiments,
which he&amp;rsquo;d been conducting for at least 12 years,
showed him clearly that cutting the workday from ten hours to eight hours—and
the workweek from six days to five days—increased
total worker output and reduced production cost…
the core of his argument was that reduced shift length meant more output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…many studies,
conducted by businesses, universities, industry associations and the military,
…support the basic notion that,
for most people,
eight hours a day,
five days per week,
is the best sustainable long-term balance point between output and exhaustion.
Throughout the 30s, 40s, and 50s, these studies were apparently conducted by the hundreds;
and by the 1960s,
the benefits of the 40-hour week were accepted almost beyond question in corporate America.
In 1962,
the Chamber of Commerce even published a pamphlet extolling the productivity gains of reduced hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, somehow, Silicon Valley didn&amp;rsquo;t get the memo…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent two years at a data visualization startup.
Three months before our first release,
the head of development &amp;ldquo;asked&amp;rdquo; us to start coming in on Saturdays.
We were already pulling one late night a week at that point
(without overtime pay—our boss seemed to think that
ten dollars&amp;rsquo; worth of pizza
was adequate compensation for four hours of work)
and most of us were also working at least a couple of hours at home in the evenings.
To no one&amp;rsquo;s surprise,
we missed our &amp;ldquo;can&amp;rsquo;t miss&amp;rdquo; deadline by ten weeks,
and had to follow up our 1.0 release with a 1.1 and then a 1.2
to fix the crash-and-lose-data bugs we&amp;rsquo;d created.
We were all zombies, and zombies can&amp;rsquo;t code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hours like these are sadly still normal in many parts of the software industry,
and may actually be worse now that so many people are working from home.
Designing and building software is a creative act that requires a clear head;
it only takes a couple of minutes to create a bug
that will take hours to track down later.
As Robinson writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;callout&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Productivity varies over the course of the workday,
with the greatest productivity occurring in the first four to six hours.
After enough hours,
productivity approaches zero;
eventually it becomes negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to quantify the productivity of programmers, testers, and UI designers
[&lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-4221-6&#34;&gt;Sadowski2019&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3454122.3454124&#34;&gt;Forsgren2021&lt;/a&gt;],
but five eight-hour days per week has been proven to maximize long-term total output
in every industry that has ever been studied.
There is no reason to believe that ours is any different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, you say, but that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;long-term&lt;/em&gt; output.
What about short bursts now and then,
like pulling an all-nighter to meet a deadline?
That&amp;rsquo;s been studied too,
and the results aren&amp;rsquo;t pleasant [&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.02544&#34;&gt;Fucci2018&lt;/a&gt;].
Your ability to think drops by 25 points for each 24 hours you&amp;rsquo;re awake.
Put it another way,
the average person&amp;rsquo;s IQ is only 75 after one all-nighter,
which puts them in the bottom 5% of the population.
Two all nighters in a row and their effective IQ is 50—the level at which
people are considered incapable of independent living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catch in all of this is that people usually don&amp;rsquo;t notice their abilities declining.
Just like drunks who think they&amp;rsquo;re still able to drive,
people who are deprived of sleep don&amp;rsquo;t realize that they&amp;rsquo;re not finishing their sentences (or thoughts).
They certainly don&amp;rsquo;t realize that they&amp;rsquo;re calling functions with parameters in the wrong order
or that the reason the tests are failing is that
they&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten to redeploy the application—again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first and most important lesson is therefore
to think about what&amp;rsquo;s more important—how much you produce
or how much of a martyr you appear to be—and to pace yourself accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

I hope peopple are inspired by it to write equivalent books for JavaScript, Python, and other languages,

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A junk &amp;ldquo;study&amp;rdquo; about &amp;ldquo;ghost engineers&amp;rdquo; popped up a few weeks ago claiming that 9.5% of software developers do nothing.
The author, Yegor Denisov-Blanch, has consistently dodged questions about methodology and refused to share data,
but I&amp;rsquo;m willing to bet his work has been seen by more practitioners in the past 30 days
than every careful, peer-reviewed piece of empirical software engineering research published this year.
I think it would be very cool if an enterprising grad student proved this,
i.e.,
estimated the number of times Denisov-Blanch&amp;rsquo;s work has been viewed or mentioned
and compared it to the number of views and mentions of work from ICSE or &lt;em&gt;Empirical Software Engineering&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly,
I think the software engineering research community should ask themselves
why stuff like this gets so much attention when their work doesn&amp;rsquo;t,
and ask themselves what they should do in order to have that kind of impact.
Public health researchers are doing this kind of critical reflection right now
to figure out how anti-vaccination conspiracy theories have displaced actual science in so many people&amp;rsquo;s minds
so that they can fight back;
if people who study software and software developers want to do more than just observe—if they want
to have some actual impact—I think they would do well to look at why bullshit finds such a large audience.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Not Very Scalable</title>
   <link href="https://third-bit.com/2024/12/27/not-very-scalable/"/>
   <updated>2024-12-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
   <id>https://third-bit.com/2024/12/27/not-very-scalable/</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been teaching some informal lessons to colleagues based on
the Python version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Software Design by Example&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
and one thing that has bothered me is the sizing of the diagrams.
It&amp;rsquo;s not too bad in a chapter like &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/glob/&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;,
but when those same SVG files are displayed in &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/glob/slides/#2&#34;&gt;slides like these&lt;/a&gt;
they are a bit hard to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought the solution would be simple:
&amp;ldquo;SVG&amp;rdquo; stands for &amp;ldquo;Scalable Vector Graphics&amp;rdquo;,
so I should just be able to apply a scaling factor via CSS to enlarge the diagrams
when they are displayed in slide files.
(Modifying the source isn&amp;rsquo;t an option:
they are all carefully sized for the print edition,
and I&amp;rsquo;m not going to duplicate 107 diagrams to solve what is in reality a minor annoyance.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what scaling factor should I apply and how should I apply it?
I can&amp;rsquo;t specify an absolute width or a page-relative fraction:
the source diagrams have different intrinsic sizes,
so either of those options would result in different diagrams being scaled by different amounts.
Doing this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t actually be so bad if they just contained lines,
but they all have text as well,
and if some of the diagrams are effectively scaled from (for example) 12-point to 15-point
while others are scaled from 12-point to 18-point,
it really stands out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s worse is that when I scale up the SVG by a fixed amount (e.g., 120%)
it overlaps with the text below it.
A bit of poking around revealed that the browser lays out the text on the slide
using the SVG&amp;rsquo;s original (intrinsic) size,
and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; resizes the SVG.
It isn&amp;rsquo;t noticeable if the figure is the last or only thing on the slide,
but that&amp;rsquo;s not always the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best solution so far comes from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/camerondecoster/&#34;&gt;Cameron DeCoster&lt;/a&gt;,
and relies on the fact that all of these SVG images are contained in &lt;code&gt;figure&lt;/code&gt; elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nd&#34;&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;--image-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;figure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nc&#34;&gt;fullwidth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nc&#34;&gt;centered&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nc&#34;&gt;scaled-img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c&#34;&gt;/*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;c&#34;&gt;    Setting the width to a percentage increases the size of the of&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;c&#34;&gt;    the image, but the width of the image is calculated using the&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;c&#34;&gt;    */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;120&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c&#34;&gt;/* width: 500px; */&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;c&#34;&gt;    Using a scale transform increases the size of the image but&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;c&#34;&gt;    doesn&amp;#39;t update the page layout.  As such, the image element&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;c&#34;&gt;    will begin to overlap surrounding elements at higher scales.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;c&#34;&gt;    */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c&#34;&gt;/* transform: scale(1.6); */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s still not perfect:
as the image below shows,
the rescaled figure is no longer centered.
As Cameron explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The centering issue is due to the fact that there&amp;rsquo;s a cyclic dependency between two elements:
the image and the container.
Using flexbox on the figure with center justified content means that
the content of the container (the image) will set the width.
However, we&amp;rsquo;re using a percentage for the width on the image,
which depends on the width of the parent (the container).
The W3C resolves this as stated &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#cyclic-percentage-contribution&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
The result is that the initial width calculation is performed using the original size of the image,
then the container is centered,
then the image is scaled.
Unfortunately,
that means that the image centering calculation is done with a different width than the image we see,
and things look wonky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://third-bit.com/files/2024/decoster-css.png&#34; alt=&#34;DeCoster CSS example&#34; width=&#34;90%&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SVG is now 25 years old.
I think &amp;ldquo;scale this up&amp;rdquo; ought to be a lot easier than it is,
but my real gripe is that I have no idea how the average person
would ever figure this out.

   <title>Wrapping Up the Year</title>
   <link href="https://third-bit.com/2024/12/15/wrapping-up-the-year/"/>
   <updated>2024-12-15T00:00:00Z</updated>
   <id>https://third-bit.com/2024/12/15/wrapping-up-the-year/</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another year, another look back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I Did&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/2024/04/05/moving-on/&#34;&gt;Deep Genomics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/2024/04/29/new-job-at-plotly/&#34;&gt;joined Plotly&lt;/a&gt;,
    where I deleted several hundred GitHub repositories
    and closed several thousand stale issues.
    I still enjoy coding and teaching more than I enjoy managing,
    but most tech companies don&amp;rsquo;t realize they need teachers,
    and most seem uncomfortable when faced with 61-year-olds who want to code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Python version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Software Design by Example&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; came out.
    Reviewers seemed to like it,
    but sales and website traffic have been disappointing.
    I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;m not working hard enough to get the word out,
    whether long-form prose is out of fashion,
    or whether I&amp;rsquo;m barking up the wrong tree,
    but as &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/2024/12/14/snailz/&#34;&gt;I wrote&lt;/a&gt; a couple of weeks ago,
    I&amp;rsquo;ve shelved &lt;a href=&#34;https://lessonomicon.github.io/rsdx/&#34;&gt;a planned follow-up&lt;/a&gt; as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a related note,
    I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://lessonomicon.github.io/querynomicon/&#34;&gt;a tutorial on SQL&lt;/a&gt; for data scientists.
    I started a couple of others,
    but since I don&amp;rsquo;t have an audience or venue lined up,
    I doubt I&amp;rsquo;ll ever finish them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/t3/&#34;&gt;the teaching workshop&lt;/a&gt; a couple of times to raise money for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rainbowrailroad.org/&#34;&gt;Rainbow Railroad&lt;/a&gt;,
    who need support now more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appeared on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://codeforthought.buzzsprout.com/1326658/episodes/15010367-en-carpentries-for-all-greg-wilson&#34;&gt;Code for Thought&lt;/a&gt;,
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/episode/5wS3jB1d3Hq3hhWo4pFunA&#34;&gt;CoRecursive&lt;/a&gt;,
    and &lt;a href=&#34;https://pod.link/1602572955/episode/7de37354dfa00eb3308e523467f410aa&#34;&gt;Software Unscripted&lt;/a&gt; podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scipy2024.scipy.org/&#34;&gt;a conference&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since COVID
    and visited the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.capbridge.com/&#34;&gt;Capilano Suspension Bridge&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in fifty years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wound down &lt;a href=&#34;https://neverworkintheory.org/&#34;&gt;It Will Never Work in Theory&lt;/a&gt; and wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/so/5555/01/10424425/1Ulj1Qa8tJ6&#34;&gt;a retrospective&lt;/a&gt; about it.
    I still post one-line summaries of interesting papers &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/ideas/nwit/&#34;&gt;on this site&lt;/a&gt;,
    but after fourteen years,
    it was time to acknowledge that
    working programmers aren&amp;rsquo;t going to care about software engineering research in my lifetime,
    and that researchers aren&amp;rsquo;t going to care enough about that to change what they do or how they do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran for the board of the Python Software Foundation and &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/2024/07/01/psf-board-nomination/&#34;&gt;came seventh&lt;/a&gt;.
    In retrospect I&amp;rsquo;m not surprised:
    I haven&amp;rsquo;t really been involved in open source communities in years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started playing the penny whistle,
    which is the only thing I&amp;rsquo;ve tried that doesn&amp;rsquo;t aggravate my tendon problems.
    I find the sound quite shrill compared to the tenor sax,
    but it&amp;rsquo;s definitely improving my lung capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t finish any of the children&amp;rsquo;s books I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing working on for the last few years,
    write any new short stories,
    or find a writing group in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the family trailbiking for the first time,
    almost had my (regular) bike stolen,
    spent Thanksgiving at the cottage,
    and went to the gym less than I should have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Year to Come&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t expect to cross anything off &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/2024/10/20/wish-list/&#34;&gt;my wish list&lt;/a&gt; this year,
but life is full of surprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My daughter will finish high school in June and leave home in August to start college.
    I don&amp;rsquo;t know how we&amp;rsquo;re going to fill our evenings and weekends without her,
    but I imagine we&amp;rsquo;ll finally get around to terracing our back yard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be supervising some &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gvwilson/browercast/&#34;&gt;undergrad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gvwilson/mossball/&#34;&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Toronto
    for the first time in 15 years.
    I&amp;rsquo;m also going to be speaking at &lt;a href=&#34;https://2025.cusec.net/&#34;&gt;CUSEC 2025&lt;/a&gt;;
    I hope this talk will age better than &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/2024/12/01/never-look-back/&#34;&gt;my last one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d really like to do an internship this summer.
    I understand why tech companies and universities and everyone else aren&amp;rsquo;t geared up for this,
    and I realize it would be unfair of me to take a position
    that might otherwise go to someone trying to start their career
    in the worst job market in my working lifetime,
    but it would be fun to be learning again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record some videos for &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Software Design by Example&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?
    Maybe, but it&amp;rsquo;s a lot of work and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure who they would help.
    The same goes for writing some of &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/ideas/not-on-the-shelves/2024/&#34;&gt;these books&lt;/a&gt;;
    I&amp;rsquo;d really like to cross one or two off the list,
    but see my note above about tech companies not realizing how much they need teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I probably won&amp;rsquo;t organize &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/2024/10/28/what-would-be-in-a-new-aosa/&#34;&gt;another volume&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://aosabook.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Architecture of Open Source Applications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
    but if you want to, please &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com&#34;&gt;reach out&lt;/a&gt;:
    I&amp;rsquo;d be happy to offer advice and support.
    Similarly,
    I might finish &lt;a href=&#34;https://lessonomicon.github.io/webonomicon/&#34;&gt;this tutorial&lt;/a&gt; on human-scale web development if I can find a writing partner;
    please &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com&#34;&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt; if you&amp;rsquo;d like to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep trying to write fiction,
    but without peers to write for or the prospect of a market,
    it&amp;rsquo;s hard to stay motivated.
    The same holds for the penny whistle:
    if I don&amp;rsquo;t find a teacher or a group to play with, I probably won&amp;rsquo;t stick with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Snailz</title>
   <link href="https://third-bit.com/2024/12/14/snailz/"/>
   <updated>2024-12-14T00:00:00Z</updated>
   <id>https://third-bit.com/2024/12/14/snailz/</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I put together notes for
a companion to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/sdxjs/&#34;&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/&#34;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; versions of &lt;em&gt;Software Design by Example&lt;/em&gt;
aimed at &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_software_engineering&#34;&gt;research software engineers&lt;/a&gt;.
I shelved &lt;a href=&#34;https://lessonomicon.github.io/rsdx/&#34;&gt;the project&lt;/a&gt; because the (lack of) reaction to the first two books
convinced me that this isn&amp;rsquo;t what most people are looking for,
but I still hope that one of the software packages I built along the way might be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pypi.org/project/snailz/&#34;&gt;Snailz&lt;/a&gt; is a set of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_data&#34;&gt;synthetic data generators&lt;/a&gt;
that simulate the collection, storage, and analysis of data related to
snails in the Pacific Northwest
that are growing unusually large as a result of exposure to pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One or more &lt;em&gt;surveys&lt;/em&gt; are conducted at one or more &lt;em&gt;sites&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each survey collects &lt;em&gt;genomes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;sizes&lt;/em&gt; of snails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;em&gt;grid&lt;/em&gt; at each site is marked out to show the presence or absence of pollution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Laboratory staff&lt;/em&gt; perform &lt;em&gt;assays&lt;/em&gt; of the snails&amp;rsquo; genetic material.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each assay plate has a &lt;em&gt;design&lt;/em&gt; showing the material applied and &lt;em&gt;readings&lt;/em&gt; showing the measured response.&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>How It Will Be Used</title>
   <link href="https://third-bit.com/2024/12/14/how-it-will-be-used/"/>
   <updated>2024-12-14T00:00:00Z</updated>
   <id>https://third-bit.com/2024/12/14/how-it-will-be-used/</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was a big proponent of MOOCs when they first emerged.
Why have thousands of teachers deliver mediocre lessons
when instead we could make the best teachers presenting the best content available to everyone?
It didn&amp;rsquo;t play out that way:
building and maintaining a good online course is difficult and expensive,
so almost everything we actually got was less effective than what we&amp;rsquo;d had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However,
MOOCs did work well for three groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A minority of people are autodidacts capable of learning from just about anything.
    (I&amp;rsquo;ve heard their number put at one in seven, but can&amp;rsquo;t back that up.)
    I strongly suspect that most professional academics are in this group,
    which leads to a lot of survivor bias in judging MOOCs&amp;rsquo; success or failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right-wing political groups have long viewed teachers with hostility,
    particularly if those teachers are unionized.
    They won&amp;rsquo;t say
    &amp;ldquo;we can gut our opponents by deskilling their profession&amp;rdquo; in public,
    but &amp;ldquo;we have to embrace the future and it will save us money&amp;rdquo; serves the same end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And speaking of money,
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/2014/03/14/learning-at-scale/&#34;&gt;I wrote in 2014&lt;/a&gt; that
    &amp;ldquo;learning at scale&amp;rdquo; is the same as &amp;ldquo;ubiquitous surveillance in the classroom&amp;rdquo;.
    I can&amp;rsquo;t talk about my direct experience of this,
    but LinkedIn didn&amp;rsquo;t buy Lynda because education is a profitable business;
    they spent 1.5 billion dollars in order to give employers even more information about job applicants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During COVID,
what had once been a witty quote had turned into reality:
online education is what everyone wants for everyone else&amp;rsquo;s kids.
As public schools pushed more content online,
private after-school tutoring exploded.
Some of it is conspicuous consumption:
today&amp;rsquo;s middle-class parents humble-brag to each other
about how much they&amp;rsquo;re spending to get their kids into the right university
in the same way that they casually mention how much their latest home renovations cost.
But some of it,
I think,
stems from a growing sense of social insecurity.
More and more middle-class parents believe (rightly) that
their jobs and their children&amp;rsquo;s futures are at risk.
If poor kids can watch the same videos as yours,
then you&amp;rsquo;re going to start looking for some secret sauce that they can&amp;rsquo;t afford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to AI in the classroom.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using LLMs to help me with a bit of programming at work,
and I understand why people like &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jonudell.net/&#34;&gt;Jon Udell&lt;/a&gt; are so excited by them:
they really do make it possible for non-experts to solve difficult problems
in a fraction of the time they would otherwise need.
My daughter isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly excited by them,
but frequently consults ChatGPT when she&amp;rsquo;s struggling through math homework,
in part because a third of the teacher&amp;rsquo;s solutions to practice problems are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes,
I think AI has a lot of potential,
but I&amp;rsquo;d like to learn from my mistake with MOOCs.
In practice,
I think AI will be used to hollow out the teaching profession.
The Japanese call this &lt;em&gt;kūdōka&lt;/em&gt;,
and it inevitably widens the gap between haves and have-nots.
In a few years—ten, maybe, but not twenty—I expect that most low-income children
will be &amp;ldquo;learning&amp;rdquo; from bots
while what&amp;rsquo;s left of the middle class spend an ever-larger fraction of their income
on actual human teachers for their kids,
both because it produces better results
and to prove that they are, in fact, middle class.
Those who are profiting from this politically and financially
will point at the poor kids who succeed as proof that everyone could,
and those who saw the possibility but discounted the risk will still be telling themselves
that with just a bit more tinkering and a bit more funding
we might still reach the promised land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope I&amp;rsquo;m wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If poor inner-city children consistently outscored children from wealthy suburban homes on standardized tests,
is anyone naive enough to believe that we would still insist on using these tests as indicators of success?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When my brother and I cleaned out my mum&amp;rsquo;s place,
I brought home a slab of fudge that she had made shortly before she died.
She was supposed to come to Ontario that month,
and my guess is that she&amp;rsquo;d planned to bring it for me as a surprise for my birthday.
I just ate the last piece of it,
and it reminded me of how long the evenings sometimes were when I was growing up.
The sun didn&amp;rsquo;t just set, at least not in the summer.
Instead,
the light ebbed little by little,
so gradually that you barely noticed it was getting darker
until something—a store closing or a light coming on in a window—made you realize
that another day had ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to make another cup of tea.
If you came in peace, be welcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Two Roads, and a Third</title>
   <link href="https://third-bit.com/2024/12/08/two-roads-and-a-third/"/>
   <updated>2024-12-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
   <id>https://third-bit.com/2024/12/08/two-roads-and-a-third/</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I caught up with some former colleagues this week,
and one of the questions that came up was,
&amp;ldquo;What would you do if you could have any job you wanted?&amp;rdquo;
I have two answers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &amp;ldquo;scholar in residence&amp;rdquo; position where I spend my time connecting people,
    mentoring junior colleagues and their projects,
    and generally trying to nudge the world (or at least my corner of our profession)
    in a slightly healthier direction.
    I&amp;rsquo;ve always enjoyed this,
    and while &lt;a href=&#34;https://aosabook.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Architecture of Open Source Applications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    and &lt;a href=&#34;https://neverworkintheory.org/&#34;&gt;It Will Never Work in Theory&lt;/a&gt; didn&amp;rsquo;t become what I hoped they would,
    other ideas might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mid-level developer position building software for scientists.
    I say &amp;ldquo;for scientists&amp;rdquo; because it&amp;rsquo;s so rewarding,
    &amp;ldquo;building&amp;rdquo; because I miss being neck-deep in code,
    and &amp;ldquo;mid-level&amp;rdquo; because I&amp;rsquo;d really like to learn
    a few of the things that slid by me over the past twenty years.
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://gleam.run/&#34;&gt;Gleam&lt;/a&gt;?
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://htmx.org/&#34;&gt;htmx&lt;/a&gt;?
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://marimo.io/&#34;&gt;Marimo&lt;/a&gt;?
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.terraform.io/&#34;&gt;Terraform&lt;/a&gt;?
    It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t really matter as long as I felt every day
    that I understood something I hadn&amp;rsquo;t understood the day before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I could combine these two roles
because I always put programming to the side if I&amp;rsquo;m managing and networking.
I also think that it would be easier for me to get the first role than the second:
our industry doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what to do with people who want to take (what is viewed as)
a step down in their career for personal satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most surprising thing is that &amp;ldquo;teaching full-time&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t on my list
for the first time in two decades.
I built &lt;a href=&#34;https://lessonomicon.github.io/querynomicon/&#34;&gt;a tutorial on SQL&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year,
and started on three others,
but it feels a bit like wandering the halls in my old high school.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know anything well enough to teach it
that I didn&amp;rsquo;t already know ten or fifteen years ago;
while there&amp;rsquo;s a lot to be said for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xR50ty5DZ0&#34;&gt;playing the standards&lt;/a&gt;,
my daughter will be moving out in a few months to start college,
and I need to find something to occupy my mind when she does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p.s. one other thing I&amp;rsquo;d put on the wish list is an office within cycling distance.
I miss being able to grab a coffee with my co-workers once or twice a week…&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have read the following recent-ish books about software engineering management
(or in a few cases, read the first couple of chapters and just skimmed the rest).
For the most part they treat the Silicon Valley model as a given,
and if they touch on things like labor rights
or what systemic discrimination reveals about how the system actually works,
they do so only in passing.
If you know of other books that are specifically about managing software development teams,
were published after 2010,
and grapple with &lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/2018/11/24/afraid-of-change/&#34;&gt;things VCs would rather not talk about&lt;/a&gt;,

   <title>Never Look Back</title>
   <link href="https://third-bit.com/2024/12/01/never-look-back/"/>
   <updated>2024-12-01T00:00:00Z</updated>
   <id>https://third-bit.com/2024/12/01/never-look-back/</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I gave a keynote at &lt;a href=&#34;http://cusec.net/&#34;&gt;CUSEC&lt;/a&gt; in 2010 about evidence-based software engineering.
A recording was available on Vimeo for several years,
but it disappeared some time after 2016.
A few days ago,
though,
I got mail out of the blue from someone who had found a copy.
They shared it with me in case I wanted to post it somewhere,
so I downloaded it and watched it through,
and now I feel a little bit sad.
In increasing order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of what I said was wrong,
    either because the claims I made were stronger than they should have been
    or because the science itself has turned out to be flawed.
    (Stereotype threat, anyone?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was rude to a couple of people in order to get laughs from the audience.
    I don&amp;rsquo;t expect any of them will read this,
    but if they do,
    I&amp;rsquo;m sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really did believe things would get better.
    They haven&amp;rsquo;t:
    students don&amp;rsquo;t learn any more about research practices or empirical results in software engineering today
    than they did fifteen years ago,
    and programmers in industry are just as oblivious as they ever were.
    I really did think that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/making-software/9780596808310/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Making Software&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/so/2024/03/10424425/1Ulj1Qa8tJ6&#34;&gt;It Will Never Work in Theory&lt;/a&gt;
    would have an impact on more than a few scattered individuals;
    I&amp;rsquo;m disappointed that they didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll post the video in a few days,
but I honestly found parts of it hard to watch.
I&amp;rsquo;ll be speaking at CUSEC again in January;
here&amp;rsquo;s hoping that talk holds up better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to make another cup of tea.
If you came in peace, be welcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
