<!-- content --><p>I have a terrible record when it comes to making predictions,
but there is one notable exception.
In 2002,
I told a room full of Python programmers in Toronto
that they would all be writing JavaScript in ten years&rsquo; time.
My argument was that since it was the only choice for front-end web programming,
it was the one language everyone <em>had</em> to learn,
and was therefore going to be the safest bet for back-end projects as well.</p>
<p>I spent the next fifteen years
cracking jokes about JavaScript&rsquo;s many failings as a language.
Since changing jobs a few months ago,
though,
I&rsquo;ve had to come to grips with its most modern version (ES6),
and have been pleasantly surprised.
Yes,
there are plenty of unpleasant surprises left over from its initial hasty design:</p>
<pre><code>[] + [] → ""              // Concatenating two empty arrays produces a string
[] + {} → [object object] // Empty array plus empty object creates an object…
{} + [] → 0               // …but empty object plus empty array is 0…
{} + {} → NaN             // …and adding two objects is Not A Number
</code></pre>
<p>but there are many pleasant surprises too,
and derivatives like <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>
are as comfortable and robust as anything I&rsquo;ve ever used.</p>
<p>I am therefore going to make another prediction.
Ten years from now,
I believe that JavaScript (or a derivative with optional strong typing)
will have supplanted Python and R
as the language of choice for people doing leading-edge open scientific computing.
My reasoning is the same as it was in 2002:
no matter what else programmers use,
they eventually have to learn JavaScript.
What&rsquo;s more,
projects like <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/">Apache Arrow</a>
are going to make it easier to add a high-performance numerical substrate.</p>
<p>The most important qualifier in the preceding paragraph is probably &ldquo;leading-edge&rdquo;.
Most people crunching numbers today are still using things like MATLAB and Excel,
and I don&rsquo;t expect that to change.
What I expect instead is that the 5-15% of scientists who are early adopters of new technology
will bypass single-purpose languages like Julia
in favor of the one they&rsquo;re already mastering
in order to take advantage of <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a> and its ilk.
And with major players like Microsoft, Google, and Facebook all working hard
to make general-purpose JavaScript faster,
it will be harder and harder for niche players to keep up.
I&rsquo;ve been wrong far more often than I&rsquo;ve been right,
but everything I know about how and why computing evolves points this way.</p><!-- /content -->
