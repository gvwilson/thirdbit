<!-- content --><p><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Freakonomics-Economist-Explores-Hidden-Everything/dp/0060731338/">Freakonomics</a></em> was a fun read,
but it was also very effective propaganda for neoliberal economics.
Rather than saying, &ldquo;Believe what I believe!&rdquo;
it said, &ldquo;Let me tell you a story.&rdquo;
That story just happened to contain a message about how the authors look at the world,
in the same way that the legends and parables of old
just happened to teach listeners right from wrong:
by example rather than by hectoring,
and so effectively that by the time the second book made
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/jul/08/climate-change-superfreakonomics-superfreakingwrong">misleading claims about climate change</a>,
a large chunk of the readership was ready and willing to be swayed.</p>
<p>Progressives don&rsquo;t seem to be nearly as good at this game as the &ldquo;respectable right&rdquo;.
I really enjoy books like Tufekci&rsquo;s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Twitter-Tear-Gas-Fragility-Networked/dp/0300215126/">Twitter and Tear Gas</a></em>
and Frase&rsquo;s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Four-Futures-After-Capitalism-Jacobin/dp/1781688133/">Four Futures</a></em>,
but that&rsquo;s like saying that devout Catholics enjoy going to Mass.
The overwhelming majority of software developers that I know don&rsquo;t read books like that:
while they&rsquo;re insightful and informative,
they aren&rsquo;t entertaining.</p>
<p>They also aren&rsquo;t accessible or welcoming,
and this has become our side&rsquo;s other great failing.
A lot of the responses on Twitter to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/opinion/academia-tech-algorithms.html">Cathy O&rsquo;Neil&rsquo;s recent piece in the <em>New York Times</em></a>
almost seem designed to confirm technologists&rsquo; belief
that social scientists have wandered off into some irrelevant corner of hyperspace.
It&rsquo;s not a fair criticism–the language her critics are using
isn&rsquo;t any more esoteric than that used by data engineers–but
that&rsquo;s not actually a compliment,
and it doesn&rsquo;t matter.
If your audience doesn&rsquo;t have the background to understand what you&rsquo;re saying,
then you either find a more approachable way to say it,
or you acknowledge that you care more about being right than about being effective.</p>
<p>And then <a href="https://jeffreymoro.com/2017/11/14/the-price-of-admission/">there&rsquo;s this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best, most revolutionary work against power is marginalized
precisely because it troubles the powerful. If &ldquo;the price to gain
admission&rdquo; is the soul of our work—our critique—then I do not know
if admission is worth the price.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People don&rsquo;t care if we martyr ourselves or not.
They dont care if something is our best work or if it troubles the powerful.
They care about whether we&rsquo;re actually going to be able to make their lives better,
and they won&rsquo;t believe us if we keep using words like &ldquo;synecdoche&rdquo;
or tell them that we need to decolonize computing.
We do,
but saying it that way is going to close ears rather than open minds.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my failed &ldquo;<a href="../../../../2016/11/13/stuff-that-actually-matters/">Stuff That Actually Matters</a>&rdquo; project.
I envisioned this as a collection of essays,
but I now realize that throwing earnest thought pieces at people
who don&rsquo;t yet believe that there&rsquo;s anything in them worth learning
isn&rsquo;t going to make a difference.
What we need is something like <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Freakonomics-Economist-Explores-Hidden-Everything/dp/0060731338/">Freakonomics</a></em>, but for good:
something that says,
&ldquo;Hey, come here, let me show you how the world really works.&rdquo;
<a href="../../../../2022/12/28/reading/">These books</a> are great examples;
if you know of others,
I&rsquo;d be grateful for pointers.</p><!-- /content -->
