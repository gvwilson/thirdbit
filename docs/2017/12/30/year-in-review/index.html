<!-- content --><ul>
<li>January</li>
<li>Ran another one-day workshop on how to teach for people in Toronto.
    It went well:
    what I learned doing instructor for Software Carpentry seems useful to a wider audience.</li>
<li>Started working on <a href="https://teachtogether.tech/">a general-purpose intro to teaching programming</a> in response.</li>
<li>Starting a reading group around <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Building-Powerful-Community-Organizations-Personal/dp/0977151808/">Building Powerful Community Organizations</a></em>
    that proved to be equally rewarding.</li>
<li>Donald Trump became president.
    It&rsquo;s tempting to joke about it,
    but it&rsquo;s the scariest thing to happen in politics in my adult life.</li>
<li>Resigned from Software Carpentry–it was time to move on.</li>
<li>February</li>
<li>Worked for Shopify for one week;
    resigned when they decided they would continue to host the online store for Breibart News.
    I just didn&rsquo;t know how I would have explained to my dad that I was helping actual fascists make money.</li>
<li>Started work at <a href="http://rangle.io">Rangle</a>.</li>
<li>March</li>
<li>Why is March?</li>
<li>Oh. It&rsquo;s for learning JavaScript.</li>
<li>April</li>
<li>Tried archery for the first time.
    Ouch.</li>
<li>Did yoga with my family a few times.
    Ouch squared.</li>
<li>Discovered Brookfield and Preskill&rsquo;s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Discussion-Book-Great-People-Talking/dp/1119049717/">The Discussion Book</a></em>.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005412">Ten Simple Rules for Making Research Software More Robust</a>&rdquo; came out.</li>
<li>Spent a few days with my best friend.
    Didn&rsquo;t do much; didn&rsquo;t need to.</li>
<li>May</li>
<li>Called off the <em>Stuff That Actually Matters</em> project.
    Only three and a half chapters had come in,
    and while it hurt to disappoint the people who&rsquo;d worked hard on them,
    there was no prospect of a complete book taking shape.</li>
<li>Released the first version of <em><a href="https://teachtogether.tech/">How to Teach Programming (and Other Things)</a></em>.</li>
<li>June</li>
<li>Visited the Aga Khan Museum for the first time.
    The world is full of beauty.</li>
<li>Had my first root canal.
    The world is full of pain as well.</li>
<li>Took my daughter&rsquo;s grade 4-6 class to the park and taught them how to play Ultimate frisbee.
    The world can be a very noisy place.</li>
<li>Ran another one-day instructor training class for a group that wants to start teaching coding
    to young women of color in one of Toronto&rsquo;s poorer neighborhoods.
    The world is full of hope, if you&rsquo;re willing to work for it.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510">Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing</a>&rdquo;
    finally came out.
    Scientific journals get there eventually, if you&rsquo;re really, really, <em>really</em> patient.</li>
<li>July</li>
<li>Left Rangle to start work with DataCamp.</li>
<li>Took my daughter to camp downtown on the trail-a-bike a few times.
    We threw a frisbee around a few times as well,
    and went swimming,
    and when my time comes,
    I hope this is what I remember.</li>
<li>Finished rewriting <em>The Cloudherd and the Tiger&rsquo;s Boy</em>.
    My daughter thinks it&rsquo;s still kind of boring–it certainly needs a better villain.</li>
<li>August</li>
<li>Nazis marched in Charlottesville and killed a young woman.</li>
<li>Shopify continued to host Breitbart&rsquo;s online store as they spread lies and hate;
    I&rsquo;m proud that I quit.</li>
<li>Posted first (incomplete) version of <em><a href="../../../../js4ds/">JavaScript versus Research Computing</a></em>.
    It needs an overhaul,
    but I&rsquo;ll only do that if there&rsquo;s interest.</li>
<li>Solar eclipses are cool.</li>
<li>September</li>
<li>More instructor training for the Toronto Public Library and for a local company.
    I feel like I&rsquo;m just scratching the surface…</li>
<li>October</li>
<li>Thanksgiving with family at the cottage.
    When my time comes,
    I hope it&rsquo;s in the autumn
    with the leaves in their glory.</li>
<li>Work week in the Azores.
    It rained a lot, and there was pineapple <em>everywhere</em>.</li>
<li>My daughter made a Hel headdress out of duct tape for Hallowe&rsquo;en.
    She&rsquo;s pretty awesome.</li>
<li>My wife passed her PMP exam on the first try.
    She&rsquo;s pretty awesome too.</li>
<li>November</li>
<li>Finished revising <em>The Bookster&rsquo;s Apprentice</em>.
    My daughter thinks it&rsquo;s OK.</li>
<li>My best friend was told that he has terminal cancer.
    I knew there would be a last game of chess some day;
    I just didn&rsquo;t know it would come so soon.</li>
<li>December</li>
<li>Wrote the first draft of this on the solstice,
    because that&rsquo;s when the year really turns.
    The world is darker than it used to be;
    I hope I&rsquo;m strong enough for what comes next.</li>
