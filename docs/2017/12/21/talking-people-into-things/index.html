<!-- content --><p>I don&rsquo;t always exhibit good judgment,
but I <em>am</em> pretty good at talking people into things.
Here are ten simple rules for doing it
that I hope you will only use for good.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t.</strong>
    If you have to talk someone into something,
    odds are that they don&rsquo;t really want to do it.
    Respect that:
    it&rsquo;s almost always better in the long run to leave some particular thing undone
    than to use guilt or any underhanded psychological tricks
    that will only engender resentment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be kind.</strong>
    I don&rsquo;t know if there actually is a book called &ldquo;Secret Tricks of the Ninja Sales Masters&rdquo;,
    but if there is,
    it probably tells readers that doing something for a potential customer
    creates a sense of obligation,
    which in turn increases the odds of a sale.
    That may work,
    but (a) it only works once
    and (b) it&rsquo;s a skeezy thing to do.
    If,
    on the other hand,
    you are genuinely kind,
    and help other people because it&rsquo;s what good people do,
    you just might inspire them to be good people too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Appeal to the greater good.</strong>
    If you open by talking about what&rsquo;s in it for them,
    you are signalling that they should think of their interaction with you
    as a commercial exchange of value to be bargained over.
    Instead,
    start by explaining how whatever you want them to help with
    is going to make the world a better place,
    and <em>mean it</em>.
    (If what you&rsquo;re proposing <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> going to make the world a better place,
    propose something better.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Start small.</strong>
    Most people are understandably reluctant to dive into things head-first,
    so give them a chance to test the waters
    and to get to know you and everyone else involved in whatever it is you want help with.
    Don&rsquo;t be surprised or disappointed if that&rsquo;s where things end:
    everyone is busy or tired or has projects of their own,
    or maybe just has a different mental model of how collaboration is supposed to work.
    Remember the 90-9-1 rule
    (90% of people will watch,
    9% will speak up,
    and 1% will actually do things)
    and set your expectations accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t build a project: build a community.</strong>
    I used to belong to a baseball team that never actually played baseball:
    our &ldquo;games&rdquo; were just an excuse for us to hang out and enjoy each other&rsquo;s company.
    If you actually want to accomplish something,
    you probably don&rsquo;t want to go quite that far,
    but sharing a cup of tea with someone
    or celebrating the birth of their first grandchild
    can get you things that no reasonable amount of money can.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Establish a point of connection.</strong>
    &ldquo;I was speaking to X&rdquo; or &ldquo;we met at Y&rdquo; gives them context,
    which in turn makes them more comfortable.
    This must be specific:
    spammers and cold-callers have trained us all to ignore anything that starts,
    &ldquo;I recently came across your website&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be specific about what you are asking for.</strong>
    People need to know this
    so that they can figure out whether the time and skills they have
    are a match for what you need.
    Being realistic up front is also a sign of respect:
    if you tell people you need a hand moving a few boxes
    when you&rsquo;re actually packing up an entire house,
    they&rsquo;re probably not going to come back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Establish your credibility.</strong>
    Mention your backers,
    your size,
    how long your group has been around,
    or something that you&rsquo;ve accomplished in the past
    so that they&rsquo;ll believe you&rsquo;re worth taking seriously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create a slight sense of urgency.</strong>
    &ldquo;We&rsquo;re hoping to launch this in the spring&rdquo;
    is more likely to get a positive response than
    &ldquo;We&rsquo;d eventually like to launch this.&rdquo;
    However,
    the word &ldquo;slight&rdquo; is also important:
    if your request is urgent,
    most people will assume you&rsquo;re disorganized or that something has gone wrong,
    and may then err on the side of prudence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Take a hint.</strong>
    If the first person you ask for help says &ldquo;no&rdquo;, ask someone else.
    If the fifth or the tenth person says &ldquo;no&rdquo;,
    as yourself if what you&rsquo;re trying to do makes sense and is worth doing.</p>
</li>
