<!-- content --><p>Hunter S. Thompson is remembered today for his gonzo style: frequently imitated, rarely matched.
What is often forgotten is how brave he was,
both in what he was willing to say and in how self-critical he was willing to be.
A prime example started with this exchange with the president he loathed in February 1972:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever else might be said about Nixon–and there is still serious doubt in my mind
that he could pass for Human–he is a goddamn stone fanatic on every facet of pro football.
At one point in our conversation,
when I was feeling a bit pressed for leverage,
I mentioned a down &amp; out pass–in the waning moments of the 1967 Super Bowl mismatch
between Green Bay and Oakland–to an obscure, second-string Oakland receiver named Bill Miller
that had stuck in my mind because of it&rsquo;s pin-point style &amp; precision.
He hesitated for a moment,
lost in thought,
then he whacked me on the thigh and laughed: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, by God! The Miami boy!&rdquo;
I was stunned.
He not only remembered the play, but he knew where Miller had played in college.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thompson goes on to write that once he realized Nixon&rsquo;s love of the game was sincere,
he began to look at the sport with a much more jaundiced eye.
If the worst president in American history (at that time) liked it,
there had to be something fundamentally wrong with it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve thought about that episode in recent months
each time Evan McMullin and other &ldquo;principled conservatives&rdquo;
have attacked Donald Trump.
If your party&rsquo;s leaders can set aside their principles to back someone so truly disgusting,
isn&rsquo;t it time you questioned not only those leaders but also those principles?
The left faced a similar agonizing reappraisal in the middle of the last century:
Stalin&rsquo;s show trials, the invasion of Hungary, the Cultural Revolution, and similar events
led many to realize that there must be something fundamentally wrong with a political philosophy
that so frequently produced horrors.
If people like McMullin and David Frum cannot find the courage to do the same,
their protests are just a game of charades.</p><!-- /content -->
