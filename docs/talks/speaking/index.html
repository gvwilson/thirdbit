<h1>Speaker's Rider</h1>



<p>I am always happy to <a href="../../talks/">give a talk</a>,
but after seeing things go wrong and speakers taken advantage of,
I now require hosts to agree to a few things in advance.</p>
<p><em>This rider is derived from the one written by <a href="https://gist.github.com/tatianamac/493ca668ee7f7c07a5b282f6d9132552">Tatiana Mac</a>.
<a href="https://opennews.org/projects/speaker-rider/">These guidelines</a>
developed by <a href="https://opennews.org/">OpenNews</a> and <a href="https://pudding.cool/">The Pudding</a>
may also be helpful.</em></p>
<h2>Inclusivity</h2>
<ul>
<li>Please note that I will usually suggest you invite a speaker who isn&rsquo;t as privileged as I am instead of me.
  I&rsquo;ve had a lot of chances to express my opinions on stage;
  I think other people, and other kinds of people, deserve that chance as well.</li>
<li>[Added Nov 2021]
  I will not take part in events that do not offer participants a fully-remote option,
  as the COVID-19 lockdown showed that this is feasible
  and that it makes events much more accessible
  to people with physical disabilities
  and people from less affluent parts of the world.</li>
</ul>
<h3>No Support for Hate</h3>
<ul>
<li>You don&rsquo;t include speakers who publicly advocate racism, misogyny, or homophobia.</li>
<li>Neither you nor your sponsors support companies
  <a href="../../2018/05/06/cigarettes-and-shopify/">that have been cited as an inspiration by a mass killer</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Strictly-enforced Code of Conduct</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your CoC explicitly explains what constitutes abusive or unacceptable behavior.</li>
<li>You have clearly defined methods for dealing with conflicts when they arise
  and trained staff to to handle complaints.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Representation</h3>
<ul>
<li>None of your tracks or panels are all straight white/Asian males.</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t <em>only</em> invite marginalized people to speak about their experiences of marginalization.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Content</h2>
<h3>Intellectual Property</h3>
<ul>
<li>I retain all rights to slides and other material I develop,
  but will make them available for reposting and rehosting under a Creative Commons license.</li>
<li>I will allow video recordings/live streams so long as they are accessible (captioned)
  and free (no paywalls).</li>
<li>You do not censor my content (visual, spoken, textual, or otherwise) without my prior express approval.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Formatting</h3>
<ul>
<li>No branding of my content (e.g., addition of someone else&rsquo;s logo) without my express prior approval.</li>
<li>I reserve the right to charge extra if my content is branded.</li>
<li>I reserve the right to charge for my labor if I am required to reformat my content in any way.
  Any such requirement, and my rate, must be agreed before a contract is signed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Costs</h2>
<h3>Reporting</h3>
<ul>
<li>I will provide receipts or invoices for all reimbursable costs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Travel expenses</h3>
<ul>
<li>My full travel costs must be covered unless the talk is in my home town (Toronto, Ontario) or given remotely by video.</li>
<li>Incidental or unexpected costs (e.g., accommodation during weather delays) must also be covered.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lodging expenses</h3>
<ul>
<li>For engagements requiring more than a three-hour flight,
  I require at least one night&rsquo;s lodging before the day I&rsquo;m scheduled to speak
  as well as lodging on the day itself.</li>
<li>You must provide the option to purchase both travel and accommodation on behalf of the speaker.
  While I may choose to pay and then claim,
  the reimbursement model excludes people who cannot carry the cost for what is sometimes months.</li>
<li>Similarly, you must leave your credit card on file for the hotel for incidental expenses.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Speaker honorarium</h3>
<ul>
<li>For for-profit conferences/events and for-profit companies, I ask for CAD $1500-3000.</li>
<li>Or CAD $500-1000 if you will donate twice the difference to a mutually-agreed charity.
  (This usually works out to roughly the same total cost for you thanks to tax write-downs.)</li>
<li>If there are multiple speakers, we must all be paid equally.
  I do not support celebrity speakers getting paid more.</li>
<li>I usually waive my free for not-for-profit/community events where tickets are free or very low priced.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ticket to full event</h3>
<ul>
<li>As <a href="https://gist.github.com/tatianamac/493ca668ee7f7c07a5b282f6d9132552">Tatiana says</a>, you wouldn&rsquo;t think it would be necessary to spell this out…</li>
</ul>
<h2>Logistics</h2>
<h3>Physically accessibility</h3>
<ul>
<li>All areas that are part of the conference must be accessible,
  including attendee seating,
  the stage,
  and social event venues
  (where &ldquo;accessible&rdquo; means &ldquo;complies with <a href="https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/2010ADAStandards/2010ADAstandards.htm">2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design</a> or national equivalent&rdquo;).</li>
<li>You must provide live captioning (which helps everyone, not just people who are hard of hearing).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Safety and security</h3>
<ul>
<li>You must provide appropriate security at the venue.</li>
<li>You must not transfer or sell my data (not even to conference sponsors)
  without my express, prior, case-by-case approval.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Gender neutral and accessible bathrooms</h3>
<ul>
<li>You must include accessible options for all genders.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Self-identification</h3>
<ul>
<li>You must provide stickers, nametag space, or an equivalent
  so that people can indicate their preferred names, titles, and pronouns.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Scholarship program</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you have a scholarship program,
  you must be explicit about how you choose candidates,
  and must not require them to recapitulate personal trauma to be approved.</li>
<li>You should include travel costs in scholarships
  so that you aren&rsquo;t excluding people who are economically disadvantaged.
  If you can&rsquo;t do this, make it clear that they are solely ticket scholarships.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stage setup</h3>
<ul>
<li>You must ensure an accessible stage (see above).</li>
<li>You must require speakers to use a microphone
  (even—scratch that, <em>especially</em>—if they think they have loud voices,
  because otherwise you&rsquo;re requiring audience members to self-identify their needs).</li>
<li>Please provide a timer that is visible to the speaker and enforce time limits for <em>everyone</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Presentation computer</h3>
<ul>
<li>You must give speakers the option of presenting from a conference computer or their own
  (in order to accommodate custom setups, special needs, etc.).</li>
<li>You must provide an opportunity for speakers to test the setup far enough in advance of speaking
  to deal with any issues that arise.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Force Majeure</h2>
<ul>
<li>If for any reason your event, other speakers, sponsors, attendees, vendors, or messaging become problematic
  (which I reserve the right to determine),
  I reserve the right to withdraw from your event at any time.</li>
<li>If I withdraw,
  you may no longer associate me with your event in any way
  (for example, you may not use any materials I have prepared or videos of me that you have recorded).</li>
<li>You are responsible for any and all costs associated with this,
  specifically including reimbursement for canceled travel and accommodations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that I have never had to exercise this clause,
but my experiences with <a href="../../2018/05/06/cigarettes-and-shopify/">Shopify</a> and <a href="../../2019/04/15/an-exchange-with-datacamp/">DataCamp</a> have made me realize that
tech will only get better if those in power believe that the rest of us will sometimes take a stand.</p>
