## Once Upon a Time…

-   Book review editor for *[Doctor Dobb's Journal](http://drdobbs.com)*

-   Hundreds of textbooks on compilers, but none on debuggers or debugging

    -   Or build tools, or package managers, or…

## What Do You Want and Why?

-   Most people have a to-do list

-   A to-don't list is just as useful

    -   Things you have to remind yourself not to start

    -   Because life is short and you're busy

-   But other people may be looking for ideas

-   And explaining *why* I want these may help you understand what practitioners actually want from researchers

    -   Because I am really tired of our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Solitudes_(Canadian_society)">two solitudes</a>

## A Credible Measure of Productivity

-   We don't know how to measure programmers' productivity

    -   Which makes almost all claims about AI-assisted programming vacuous

-   But almost all of us believe in version control

    -   So strongly that if you find no effect we will believe your methodology is flawed

-   So have several researchers design and run that study independently

    -   Then compare results and combine methods

    -   And apply the method to other problems

> It is not enough to be right: you must also be heard.

---

## A WYSIWYG Notebook

-   Computational notebooks are ubiquitous

    -   [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) uses JSON

    -   [Marimo](https://marimo.io/) uses Python with embedded strings

    -   [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) Markdown with embedded code

-   Why not use the format (and UI) that the other 99% of our species uses?

-   Build an [extension](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/DevGuide/Extensions)
    for [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)

    -   Create tables, draw diagrams, and be taken seriously

> It's OK to be usable.

## `diff` Considered Harmful

-   Programmers really like version control

    -   But `diff` only works (comprehensibly) on punchcards

    -   So we refuse to use any richer document format

-   Is there a Unified Theory of Diff?

    -   Structural vs. textual differences in code

    -   Diagrams? Databases? Spreadsheets? Multimedia?

## Do We Use What We Teach?

Most undergraduate computer science programs have a first- or
second-year course on data structures and algorithms.  What do these
courses actually teach, how has their content changed since
Wirth's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_%2B_Data_Structures_%3D_Programs">classic
book</a> appeared in 1976, and which of these algorithms and data
structures are used in upper-year courses? To answer these
questions, this project will assemble and apply tools to analyze the
text of several dozen textbooks; along the way, the students doing
the project will have to decide how to identify topics, how to count
them, and how to make their work reproducible.

## Variable Roles

Sajaniemi et al's work
on [roles of variables](https://www.ppig.org/files/2005-PPIG-17th-sajaniemi.pdf)
identified and named ten small patterns in the way
variables are used in novice programs. This project would build
static and dynamic analysis tools to detect those patterns (and
possibly others) in programs as an aid to teaching, debugging, and
code review.

---

## Calibrated Code Review

Give a novice programmer a one-page program and have them score it
using a checklist, then grade them on how closely their scoring
matches the instructor’s. (They start with 100%, and lose one mark
for each false positive or false negative.) After doing this a
handful of times, they should learn to see code through the
instructor’s eyes. Does this help them write better code? If so, how
quickly and how well?  This project will attempt to answer these
questions.

---

## Validity of Popular Claims

Are some programmers really ten times more productive than others?
Does test-driven development actually make programmers more
productive?  And do people actually believe these claims?  This
project will conduct a quantitative survey of best-selling books on
software developmnt to measure how many of their claims are backed
by citations, and of those, how many are considered valid, then
survey programmers to see which (if any) they believe.

---

## Understanding Ethics

This project will start by creating a set of scenarios in which a
programmer needs to make an ethical decision, each with
multiple-choice options.  An expert will determine the best answer
for each; students and professionals will then be asked to answer
the same questions, and the results will be analyzed to see how well
each group matches the experts' opinions and whether practitioners'
opinions are any better than those of students.

---

## What We *Don't* Teach

Many universities offer an undergraduate course on entrepreneurship
or the business of software. This project will survey these courses
to determine what they <em>don't</em> teach. For example, how many
of these courses (if any) devote time to labor rights? How many
discuss anti-trust legislation? And how does that vary by country
and by the nature of the institution?

---

## Tooling Effort Over Time

How does the percentage of effort devoted to tooling and deployment
change as a project grows and/or ages?  And how has it changed as
we've moved from desktop applications to cloud-based applications?
Once a project reaches a certain size, does the amount of tooling
(measured by number of files or lines of configuration) level off?
Does the effort required to maintain the tooling grow as the code
base grows, or does it level off as well? Answering these questions
will give the student(s) a chance to learn how to mine software
repositories.

---

## Adoption of IDE Tools

Which features of integrated development environments (IDEs) do
students actually use? To find out, this project will have a set of
students record their screens while solving a set of programming and
debugging problems, then analyze those recordings to see whether and
when students use breakpointing debuggers, multiple cursors,
refactoring tools, and other features.
