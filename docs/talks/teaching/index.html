<!--

Hello and welcome. This hour-long talk will cover some key ideas in
evidence-based teaching that we hope you will find useful, both when
passing on what you know and when learning new things yourself. All
the material is covered by a Creative Commons license: you are free to
share and remix it so long as you cite this talk as the original
source.

We know as much about teaching and learning as we do about public
health. The problem is, most people in tech (and most university
professors) don't know what we know. By the time you leave high
school, you probably know what germs and vitamins are and where babies
come from. You probably don't know similarly basic facts about how
people learn or how best to teach them.

-->

## Rule #1

<div class="center">
<h2>Design for three different learners</h2>
</div>

<!--

Our first rule is that you have to figure out who you're teaching
before you can start to build a lesson.

-->

---

## Cognitive Progression

<div class="center">
  <img src="../../files/talks/teaching/benner.png" alt="Patricia Benner" width="300px">
  <p>Prof. Patricia Benner</p>
</div>


--

-   Novice
-   <strike>Advanced beginner</strike>
-   Competent
-   <strike>Proficient</strike>
-   Expert

<!--

Benner identified five stages, but for our purposes, we're going to
simplify the model to three and say that someone is either a novice,
competent, or an expert.

-->

---

A Novice Doesn't Have a Mental Model

<!--

Here's an example of what we mean by a mental model. In grade school
science class, you were probably taught that atoms are brightly
colored balls connected by springs. None of those things are actually
true, but it's a useful model for understanding the things people want
to understand at that stage of their development, and for solving the
problems they want to solve.

-->

---

Concept Map


<!--

Here's one possible concept map for a library from a patron's point of
view.

(Original image from Amy Hodge of Stanford University.)

-->

---

Concept Map
Here's another from the point of view of the director.


<!--

See solutions at a glance Multiple points of view Much (much) better
at debugging Have difficulty explaining their thinking Symptoms of
Being an Expert A lack of confidence doesn't necessarily mean that
someone is a novice.

-->

---

Novice

<!--

Neural networks don't map directly to concept maps, but wiring helps
explain the differences between novices, competent practitioners, and
experts. Novices don't have a lot of connections between concepts.

-->

---

Novice
Competent

<!--

Competent practitioners have more, but it can take them several steps
to get from what they know to what they need.

-->

---

Novice
Competent
Expert

<!--

Experts have many more connections, so their path is shorter—so short,
in fact, that they can often jump from start to finish in a single
step. This is also what leads to expert blind spot: they can't explain
their reasoning because there isn't any.

-->

---

Teaching Methods

novice
competent
expert

<!--

These differences mean that different teaching strategies work best
for different learners. Novices need to be guided: the teacher has to
decide what they need to learn next. Competent practitioners need to
be mentored: they can make a lot of progress on their own, and the
teacher's role is to help them get unstuck or to help them pick their
next problem. And if someone is an expert, the most effective strategy
is to help them reflect on their own work.

-->

---

Rule #2:

A lesson is a user interface
for knowledge

<!--

Our second rule is that everything we know about building user
interfaces applies directly to building lessons.

-->

---

Example Persona

M'shelle, 38, degree in CS, programmed in Java for a decade, now a project manager.
Helped build a lot of reporting tools and done budget forecasts.
Needs to know enough to hire people and arbitrate technical decisions about tools.
Single parent of two young children, so evenings and weekends are spoken for.

<!--

This is what a finished persona looks like.

-->

---

Four Different Learners

Anya Academic
Exton Excel
Larry Legacy
M'shelle Manager

<!--

We need multiple explanations because we have multiple learners. For
example, suppose we're teaching data science. Anya is a professor who
knows a lot of statistics but is new to programming; Exton has been
using Excel for years but doesn't know much stats; Larry has been
using SAS for 35 years and doesn't want to have to switch to R or
Python, and M'shelle used to be a programmer but now manages a team of
data scientists. The best intro for each person will be very
different.

-->

---

Rule #3:

Use formative assessments
as unit tests during learning

<!--

Rule number three is to check for learning as we're teaching.

-->

---

What Is 37 + 15 ?

52
42
412
43

<!--

To see how to do this, let's imagine we're teaching some children how
to do multi-digit addition, and we ask them to add 37 and 15.  If they
say "52", then either they understand how to do it or they've made a
lucky guess.  If they got "42", they probably didn't carry. In fact,
they probably wrote down "12" as the sum of 7 and 5, and then added 3
and 1 to get 4 and wrote that on top of the "1" from "12".  What if
they got 412? In this case, they still don't understand how to carry,
but it's a step forward: they're keeping the 1.  And what about 43?
This child has almost got it: they've carried the 1, but they've
carried it back into the 1's column because they don't understand it's
a 10.

-->

---

Diagnosing Misconceptions


<!--

Forces the instructor to build a mental model of the learners' mental
models Each of the learners who gave a wrong answer has a different
misconception. Each one therefore needs a different explanation to
move forward. It might be a linear progression or it might not; what's
important is that if you don't understand what they don't understand,
you're just guessing about what to say next.

-->

---

Quick (30-60 seconds)
Unambiguous (scalable)
Diagnostic power
Formative Assessment
"Can I move on?"

<!--

They tell instructors whether they can move on or not (and if not, why
not).

-->

---

Formative Assessment

"Do I understand this?"
Quick (30-60 seconds)
Unambiguous (scalable)
Diagnostic power

<!--

And they give learners a way to check that they actually understand
something (because it's easy to believe you do until you try to use
knowledge).

-->

---

Rule #4:

Manage cognitive load

<!--

The fourth rule is to avoid overloading the learner.

-->

---

Cognitive Architecture

<!--

In simple form, we have two types of memory: long-term and short-term.

-->

---

Cognitive Architecture

<!--

On the input side, most data (for most people) comes through the
visual channel, is integrated with linguistic information, then
encoded and stored.

-->

---

Reading Is Weird

<!--

This model also explains why it's less effective to present the same
information as text and speech, such as by reading text-heavy slides
aloud or by having captions that "say" the same thing as the
presenter. Text comes in through the visual channel, but is then
shunted sideways to the verbal channel. Your brain can't help but try
to reconcile the two streams of speech it's receiving (one through
your eyes and one through your ears), and doing that takes mental
effort away from encoding the information for storage.

-->

---

The Magic Number 7 ± 2

<!--

Short-term memory is a serious cognitive bottleneck. Estimates in the
1950s were that it could hold 7±2 items; more recent estimates put the
number closer to 4.

-->

---

<!--

This is why phone numbers are as long as they are. It may also be why
the basic unit of human social organization is half a dozen
people. From sports teams and military formations through knitting
circles to meetings, that seems to be the limit of the number of
people who can all be talking or working with one another at a
time. Beyond that, larger groups quickly break down into
sub-groups. (If you have 20 people in a meeting, you either have three
meetings going on or one meeting of half a dozen people with a bunch
of bystanders.)

-->

---

One Thing at a Time

<!--

Balance bikes.

-->

---

This Is Hard


<!--

Memorize the symbol used to represent each number.

-->

---

Let's Try That Again


<!--

Does this make it easier?

-->

---

Cognitive Load


<!--

To explain the differences, imagine that you're learning to speak
Frisian, and that you've been asked to translate this sentence. You
have to do two things: recall some words, and arrange them
grammatically.

-->

---

Cognitive Load

How is her knee today?


<!--

But suppose I give you the words you need, so that all you have to do
is arrange them in the right order.

-->

---

Cognitive Load

<!--

I've made them problem much simpler by giving you the vocabulary and
allowing you to focus your attention on the grammar.

-->

---

Cognitive Load

Intrinsic
What the learning task is supposed to be about
Grammar
Germane
Extra relevant work (such as retrieving supporting information)
Vocabulary
Extrinsic
Handling irrelevancies
Fonts

<!--

In general, intrinsic load is what the learning task is supposed to be
about. Germane load is extra relevant work, such as remembering words
or picking a proof strategy. Extrinsic load is irrelevancies. In this
case, the intrinsic load is figuring out the order of the words. The
germane load is recalling the words, which we can reduce by giving
them to you. And the extrinsic load is the use of a different font for
each word: it draws your attention, but it doesn't add anything to the
lesson.

-->

---

Rule #5:

Active beats passive

<!--

Rule number five is that active learning beats passive learning.

-->

---

Two Ways to Learn

Read about something
Try it out
Watch a video
Do exercises
Attend a lecture
Discuss a topic
Hear something explained
Try to explain it

<!--

The strategies on the left are "learn now, use later". Those on the
right are "use while learning", and the latter always beats the
former.

…but university students report that they prefer passive learning…

For example, this plot shows reduction in failure rates in STEM
classes (from http://www.pnas.org/content/111/23/8410.full.pdf), and
we now have the cognitive science to explain why. However, learners
report that they prefer passive learning, even though active learning
works better (https://www.pnas.org/content/116/39/19251)

-->

---

Six Strategies

Spaced practice
Interleaving
Retrieval practice
Concrete examples
Elaboration
Dual coding


<!--

http://learningscientists.org There are six strategies that you and
your learners can use to leverage all of this, and the best summary of
them comes from the Learning Scientists website. We don't have time to
go through them all…

-->

---

Interleaving

Randomize study order to build long-range connections
And to avoid accidentally training your brain to recall things only in a specific order

<!--

…but this is my favorite: randomizing study order improves learning.

-->

---

Rule #6:

Learners are not robots

<!--

It shouldn't be necessary to say this, but our sixth rule is that
learners are people with feelings and beliefs.

-->

---

Motivation

Intrinsic
Doing this for my own reasons
Extrinsic
Doing this because I have to

<!--

The single strongest predictor of whether an adult learns something or
not is their motivation, and any discussion of motivation has to start
with the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic
motivation. Learning to play the ukulele because you've always wanted
to is intrinsic; learning because you're in Grade 5 and the teacher
said so is extrinsic, and unlikely to stick.

-->

---

Positive: Self-Efficacy

I am in control of my own life.

<!--

First and most importantly, adults want to be in control of their own
lives - they don't like to jump through hoops. Self-efficacy is the
driving force behind self-paced online training: it allows people
(well, those privileged enough to have free time) to learn what they
want and when they want.

-->

---

Positive: Utility

This will help me meet my goals.

<!--

Utility is the second big motivator for adults. Is this useful? Will
it help me meet my goals? (It's important to note that there are many
kinds of utility, just as people have many different kinds of
goals—learning the ukulele probably won't help you find a job, but
that's not why you're doing it.)

-->

---

Positive: Community

People I know are learning this with me.

<!--

The third motivator is community. People like to do what their
friends, neighbors, and colleagues are doing, and they like to do
things together - this is why the best predictor of whether someone
actually uses a gym membership is whether or not someone they know is
going with them.

-->

---

Negative: Unpredictability

What I do doesn't seem to affect the outcome.

<!--

Now let's look at demotivators. The most important is
unpredictability: if taking actions works some of the time, but not
other times, people give up trying because there's no point. This is
called learned helplessness.

-->

---

Negative: Unfairness

The teacher plays favorites.

<!--

A second big demotivator is unfairness. Studies have shown that if
people believe the game is rigged, everyone will do less well—even
those that the game is rigged in favor of.

-->

---

Negative: Indifference

Nobody cares.

<!--

The third of our demotivators is indifference—the feeling that nobody
cares if you succeed or not. It's easy for students to feel this way
in large classes or when learning online, but it's also easy for
instructors to give this impression even when they're teaching
one-to-one.

-->

---

Myths

Visual/auditory/kinesthetic learning styles are the astrology of teaching
Meyers-Briggs Type Indicators are astrology too
The Learning Pyramid was made up by an ad agency

<!--

At this point you might think we believe that everything about
education can be explained in terms of cognitive science. We don't,
because we don't yet have all the science. More importantly, there are
a lot of pseudoscientific myths about education that refuse to die:
People don't actually learn better if lesson materials are tailored to
visual, auditory, or kinesthetic learning styles The so-called
"learning pyramid" (10% of what you read, 30% of what you see—the
numbers vary) is completely made up.  The status of some other ideas,
like stereotype threat and growth mindset, is currently unknown. They
make sense, and early studies seemed to bear them out, but more recent
work hasn't been as clear. But this is how science works: we test and
refine our ideas, and change our opinions as more evidence comes in.

-->

---

Wrapping up

<!--

So let's wrap up.

-->

---

What Next?

<!--

Critics sometimes say that online education is what everybody wants
for somebody else's children. They're right, but only if the online
education is done poorly (as it is in most MOOCs). The most important
distinction isn't online versus in-person; it's interactive versus
scripted. Books and videos have far more in common with each other
than they do with chat groups or in-person discussions. I think the
future of education looks like my daughter playing Minecraft: she
doesn't care if the people she's playing with are sitting beside her
or an ocean away as long as they can talk to each other in real time.

-->

What Next?

These rules are not the whole of teaching, but they're a pretty good
start.  Thank you for listening.

Count Them All

<!--

Limits to short-term memory can tell us when we're trying to teach too
much, too quickly. This concept map has nineteen things in it. That's
too many, so part of the craft of designing a lesson is to break it
into chunks guided by the formative assessments we can do.

-->

---

Count Them All

<!--

Here are some digestible chunks.

-->

---

Learner Personas

General background
Relevant experience
Their perceived needs
Special considerations

<!--

We can capture these differences by creating learner personas with
these features. Anyone who teachers, or any group that teaches
together, should create a handful of these that describe the range of
learners they're trying to help. Personas will remind you of one of
the most important rules of teaching: you are not your learners.

-->

---

The Bad News

Neither the training programs that most companies put all workers
through nor the grievance procedures that they have implemented are
helping to solve the problem of sexual harassment in the workplace. In
fact, both tend to increase worker disaffection and turnover.

— Dobbin & Kalev

Bystander intervention training…is the most promising alternative we've come across…

---

Allyship Scenario

A student in your class has a medically diagnosed attention
challenge. To maintain focus, they have to talk to themselves while
problem solving. Some other students in the class have come to you and
said they find this distracting. What steps would you take in what
order?

<!--

This is an example of the kind of scenario teachers should go through.
