## In the Beginning

<img src="ships.jpg" alt="Sailing ships" class="center">

- Seven Years' War (actually lasted nine years)
- British lost 1512 sailors to enemy action…
- …and almost 100,000 to scurvy

---

## Irony

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-6 center">
    <img src="james-lind.jpg" alt="James Lind">
  </div>
  <div class="col-6">
    <ul>
      <li>James Lind (1716–94)</li>
      <li>1747: first controlled medical experiment</li>
    </ul>
    <table>
      <tr>
	<td>cider</td>
	<td>sea water</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>vitriol</td>
	<td>vinegar</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>barley water</td>
	<td>oranges</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
</div>

- Those given oranges survived
- Admiralty ignored the result until 1794

---

## It Took a While

<img src="doctors.jpg" alt="Doctors" class="center">

- 1950: Hill & Doll publish a case-control study comparing smokers with non-smokers
- Found that smoking causes lung cancer…
- …and that many people would rather fail than change

---

## Is Software Engineering?

<img src="./engineer-600.jpg" alt="Street Preacher" class="center">

- "The use of the scientific method to design novel things"
- So… no

---

## Chickens and Eggs

<img src="../../files/talks/blind-leading-blind.png" alt="The blind leading the blind" class="center">

- We know a lot about software and how it's built
- But students aren't taught methods or results in school
- And we're all too busy to learn them later

---

## We Can Do Better

- Steady growth of empirical studies over 30 years
- Fueled in part by data from open source projects
- Many studies are small, and not all are well done
- But we can refute some myths and reveal new insights

<img src="./icse-2023.png" alt="ICSE 2023" width="80%" class="center">

---

## Are Some Languages Better?

<a href="#Stefik2013">Stefik2013</a>: "An Empirical Investigation into Programming Language Syntax"

- Measured how easily novices could read:
  - Perl
  - Quorum: the language their team is building
  - Randomo: syntax "designed" by rolling D&D dice

- Perl is as hard for novices to learn as a language with a randomly-designed syntax

---

## Are Some Languages Better?

- Second study
  - More subjects
  - Multiple assessment strategies
- Languages in the C family are as hard for novices to learn to read as a randomly-designed language
- Ruby and Python are significantly easier
- Quorum is easier still

---

## Productivity

- <a href="#Prechelt2000">Prechelt2000</a> had programmers implement the same thing in the language of their choice
- How long did it take?

<img src="productivity.svg" class="center">

---

## Productivity

- Shortest and longest times were 0.6 and 63 hours
  - Ratio is 150X (!)
- But people used 7 different languages
- If we only look at Java, times are 3.8 vs. 63 hours (17X)
- But comparing best and worst exaggerates differences
- 90th percentile vs. 50th gives 3.7X

---

## Test-Driven Development

<a href="#Shull2010">Shull2010</a>: "How Effective is Test-Driven Development?"

> …evidence from controlled experiments suggests an
> improvement in productivity when TDD is used.
> However…pilot studies provide mixed evidence, some in
> favor of and others against TDD. In the industrial
> studies…evidence suggests that TDD yields worse
> productivity. Even when considering only the more rigorous
> studies…the evidence is equally split for and against a
> positive effect.

---

## Test-Driven Development

<a href="#Fucci2016">Fucci2016</a>: "An External Replication on the Effects of Test-driven Development Using a Multi-site Blind Analysis Approach"

- Replication study, 39 professionals, real projects
- No significant difference between test-first and test-last development
- "The claimed benefits of TDD may…rather [be] due to the fact that [it] encourages fine-grained steady steps that improve focus and flow."

--

> I practice TDD…and it works great. We don't need to prove that it works anymore.

---

## Nobody Knows Anything

<a href="#Altadmri2016">Altadmri2016</a>: "37 Million Compilations: Investigating Novice Programming Mistakes in Large-Scale Student Data"

- Ask educators for learners' most common mistakes
- Compare their answers to empirical data
- Weak consensus among educators
- Weak correlation with observations
- Educator experience had only weak impact on results

---

## Nobody Knows Anything

Most common actual errors are:

- Mis-matched parentheses (*not* confusing `=` with `==`)
- Invoking methods with the wrong arguments
- Reaching end of non-`void` method without `return`

The three that take the most time to fix are:

- Confusing  short-circuit logical and bitwise operators
- Using `==` instead of `.equals` to compare strings
- Ignoring the return value from a non-void method

---

## A Caution

<a href="#Begel2014">Begel2014</a>: "Analyze This! 145 Questions for Data Scientists in Software Engineering"

- Ask a bunch of developers to propose questions, then ask another bunch to rate them
- Developers want to know how people actually use their products
- They *don't* want assessments of individual performance
  - Because they're afraid such measures will be weaponized

---

## Open Source

<a href="#Steinmacher2015">Steinmacher2015</a>: "Social Barriers Faced by Newcomers Placing Their First Contribution in Open Source Software Projects"

- Identify 58 potential barriers
- What matters most?
  1. How easy it is to get set up to make a contribution
  1. How easy it is to find a task to start with
- Other work has also identified "how warmly first contribution was received"

---

## There Is No "Geek Gene"

<a href="#Patitsas2016">Patitsas2016</a>: "Computer Science Grades Are Not Bimodal"

- The "geek gene" is computing's most enduring and damaging myth
- In fact, only 5.8% of course grade distributions at a large university were actually multi-modal
- But CS faculty are more likely to see distributions as bimodal if they think they're from a CS class
- Even *more* likely if they believe some students are innately predisposed to do well in CS

---

## Code Metrics

- Lots of code metrics have been proposed
  - Halstead's measures
  - Cyclomatic complexity
  - Many object-oriented measures
- But nothing works better than counting lines of code
  - <a href="#ElEmam2001">ElEmam2001</a>: "Confounding Effects of Class Size on the Validity of Object-Oriented Metrics"
  - <a href="#Herraiz2010">Herraiz2010</a>: "Beyond Lines of Code: Do We Need More Complexity Metrics?"

---

## Test Flakiness

<a href="#Costa2022">Costa2022</a>: "Test Flakiness Across Programming Languages"

<img src="costa2022-table6.png" class="center">

---

## Who Fixes What?

- Original authors fix their own simple bugs much faster than other people (<a href="#Zhu2021">Zhu2021</a>)
- But are more likely to fix or change other things at the same time

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-6 center">

## Language Features

    <img src="typescript-features.png" alt="Typescript feature adoption" width="90%">
    <br>
    From [<a href="#Scarsbrook2023">Scarsbrook2023</a>]
  </div>
</div>

-   Nobody knows anything…

---

## Miscellaneous

- Design patterns
  - Teaching people design patterns makes them better programmers (<a href="#Tichy2010">Tichy2010</a>)
  - Three experiments demonstrated cause and effect
  - This is *not* obvious
    - Maybe good programmers are just more likely to use patterns
- Fuzz testing
  - Invented by accident in 1988 (<a href="#Miller2021">Miller2021</a>)
  - 25-33% of Unix utilities crashed when fuzzed
  - Thirty years later, "only" 12-20% still crash
  - [*The Fuzzing Book*](https://www.fuzzingbook.org/)

---

## Miscellaneous

- Strong typing catches about 15% of bugs (<a href="#Gao2017">Gao2017</a>)
  - Which is a lot or a little depending on your point of view
- Only 6-17% of configuration options are set by most users (<a href="#Xu2015">Xu2015</a>)
  - Only 2%-8% of parameters are configured by more than 90% of users
- Secret management is a solved problem
  - But most developers don't know the solutions (<a href="#Basak2023">Basak2023</a>)
---

## What Hasn't Worked?

- People have tried explaining all of this before

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-3"><img src="./rapid-development.jpg" width="70%"></div>
  <div class="col-3"><img src="./facts-fallacies.jpg" width="70%"></div>
  <div class="col-3"><img src="../../files/talks/making-software.jpg" width="70%"></div>
</div>

<div class="center">
  <a href="https://neverworkintheory.org/"><strong>https://neverworkintheory.org/</strong></a>
</div>

---

## What Might?

- Start with a little data science
  - Using software engineering datasets (because people learn best when examples are relevant)
  - And Python (because computer science students will probably already know it)
  - Academically defensible ("Look, math!")
  - And attractive to students
- Then replicate a few simple results
- At this point, students will be able to understand and assess the claims

---

## When We're Done

**Assignment #3**

> Given version control repositories for six software
> projects, determine whether long functions are
> more likely to be buggy than short ones.

- Requires tool use, model building, and statistics
- Require students to *do* science
  - So they *understand* it
  - So they *value* it

---

## Conclusions

<img src="./wikipedian_protester.png" class="center">

- The world needs more of this
- What are you waiting for?
