## In the Beginning

<img src="ships.jpg" alt="Sailing ships" class="center">

-   Seven Years' War (actually lasted nine years)
-   British lost 1512 sailors to enemy action…
-   …and almost 100,000 to scurvy

---

## Irony

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-6 center">
    <img src="james-lind.jpg" alt="James Lind">
  </div>
  <div class="col-6">
    <ul>
      <li>James Lind (1716–94)</li>
      <li>1747: first controlled medical experiment</li>
    </ul>
    <table>
      <tr>
	<td>cider</td>
	<td>sea water</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>vitriol</td>
	<td>vinegar</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>barley water</td>
	<td>oranges</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
</div>

-   Those given oranges survived
-   Admiralty ignored the result until 1794

## It Took a While

<img src="doctors.jpg" alt="Doctors" class="center">

-   1950: Hill & Doll publish a case-control study comparing smokers with non-smokers
-   Found that smoking causes lung cancer…
-   …and that many people would rather fail than change

---

## Is Software Engineering?

<img src="./engineer-600.jpg" alt="Street Preacher" class="center">

-   "The use of the scientific method to design novel things"
-   So… no

---

## Chickens and Eggs

<img src="../../files/talks/blind-leading-blind.png" alt="The blind leading the blind" class="center">

-   We know a lot about software and how it's built
-   But students aren't taught methods or results in school
-   And we're all too busy to learn them later

---

## We Can Do Better

-   Steady growth of empirical studies over 30 years
-   Fueled in part by data from open source projects
-   Many studies are small, and not all are well done
-   But we can refute some myths and reveal new insights

<img src="./icse-2023.png" alt="ICSE 2023" width="80%" class="center">

---

## Are Some Languages Better?

<a href="#Stefik2013">Stefik2013</a>: "An Empirical Investigation into Programming Language Syntax"

-   Measured how easily novices could read:
    -   Perl
    -   Quorum: the language their team is building
    -   Randomo: syntax "designed" by rolling D&D dice
-   Perl is as hard for novices to learn as a language with a randomly-designed syntax

---

## Are Some Languages Better?

-   Second study
    -   More subjects
    -   Multiple assessment strategies
-   Languages in the C family are as hard for novices to learn to read as a randomly-designed language
-   Ruby and Python are significantly easier
-   <a href="https://quorumlanguage.com/">Quorum</a> is easier still

---

## Productivity

-   <a href="#Prechelt2000">Prechelt2000</a> had programmers implement the same thing in the language of their choice
-   How long did it take?

<img src="productivity.svg" class="center">

---

## Productivity

-   Shortest and longest times were 0.6 and 63 hours
    -   Ratio is 150X (!)
-   But people used 7 different languages
-   If we only look at Java, times are 3.8 vs. 63 hours (17X)
-   But comparing best and worst exaggerates differences
-   90th percentile vs. 50th gives 3.7X

## Test-Driven Development

<a href="#Shull2010">Shull2010</a>: "How Effective is Test-Driven Development?"

> …evidence from controlled experiments suggests an
> improvement in productivity when TDD is used.
> However…pilot studies provide mixed evidence, some in
> favor of and others against TDD. In the industrial
> studies…evidence suggests that TDD yields worse
> productivity. Even when considering only the more rigorous
> studies…the evidence is equally split for and against a
> positive effect.

---

## Test-Driven Development

<a href="#Fucci2016">Fucci2016</a>: "An External Replication on the Effects of Test-driven Development Using a Multi-site Blind Analysis Approach"

-   Replication study, 39 professionals, real projects
-   No significant difference between test-first and test-last development
-   "The claimed benefits of TDD may…rather [be] due to the fact that [it] encourages fine-grained steady steps that improve focus and flow."

> I practice TDD…and it works great. We don't need to prove that it works anymore.

---

## Nobody Knows Anything

<a href="#Altadmri2016">Altadmri2016</a>: "37 Million Compilations: Investigating Novice Programming Mistakes in Large-Scale Student Data"

-   Ask educators for learners' most common mistakes
-   Compare their answers to empirical data
-   Weak consensus among educators
-   Weak correlation with observations
-   Educator experience had only weak impact on results

---

## Nobody Knows Anything

Most common actual errors are:

-   Mis-matched parentheses (*not* confusing `=` with `==`)
-   Invoking methods with the wrong arguments
-   Reaching end of non-`void` method without `return`

The three that take the most time to fix are:

-   Confusing  short-circuit logical and bitwise operators
-   Using `==` instead of `.equals` to compare strings
-   Ignoring the return value from a non-void method

---

## A Caution

<a href="#Begel2014">Begel2014</a>: "Analyze This! 145 Questions for Data Scientists in Software Engineering"

-   Ask a bunch of developers to propose questions, then ask another bunch to rate them
-   Developers want to know how people actually use their products
-   They *don't* want assessments of individual performance
    -   Because they're afraid such measures will be weaponized

---

## Coding in the Dark

<a href="#Hicks2022">Hicks2022</a>: "It's like coding in the dark: The need for learning cultures within coding teams"

-   …the work that code writers needed to do to understand code often did not feel like what was rewarded in the evaluation of their work
-   Despite stated ideals about knowledge sharing…this work was often contradicted with negative cues from colleagues about what was truly valued
-   This tension was exacerbated by code writers' fears about not looking like an engineer…
-   Code writers navigated this by divesting from their own learning and from the invisible work of knowledge transfer
-   [They] frequently expressed a poignant loneliness, even in highly resourced teams

---

## Open Source

<a href="#Steinmacher2015">Steinmacher2015</a>: "Social Barriers Faced by Newcomers Placing Their First Contribution in Open Source Software Projects"

-   Identify 58 potential barriers
-   What matters most?
    1.  How easy it is to get set up to make a contribution
    1.  How easy it is to find a task to start with
-   Other work has also identified "how warmly first contribution was received"

---

## There Is No "Geek Gene"

<a href="#Patitsas2016">Patitsas2016</a>: "Computer Science Grades Are Not Bimodal"

-   The "geek gene" is computing's most enduring and damaging myth
-   In fact, only 5.8% of course grade distributions at a large university were actually multi-modal
-   But CS faculty are more likely to see distributions as bimodal if they think they're from a CS class
-   Even *more* likely if they believe some students are innately predisposed to do well in CS

---

## Code Metrics

-   Lots of code metrics have been proposed
    -   Halstead's measures
    -   Cyclomatic complexity
    -   Many object-oriented measures
-   But nothing works better than counting lines of code
    -   <a href="#ElEmam2001">ElEmam2001</a>: "Confounding Effects of Class Size on the Validity of Object-Oriented Metrics"
    -   <a href="#Herraiz2010">Herraiz2010</a>: "Beyond Lines of Code: Do We Need More Complexity Metrics?"

## Who Fixes What?

-   Original authors fix their own simple bugs much faster than other people (<a href="#Zhu2021">Zhu2021</a>)
-   But are more likely to fix or change other things at the same time

## Miscellaneous

-   Design patterns
    -   Teaching people design patterns makes them better programmers (<a href="#Tichy2010">Tichy2010</a>)
    -   Three experiments demonstrated cause and effect
    -   This is *not* obvious
    -   Maybe good programmers are just more likely to use patterns
-   Fuzz testing
    -   Invented by accident in 1988 (<a href="#Miller2021">Miller2021</a>)
    -   25-33% of Unix utilities crashed when fuzzed
    -   Thirty years later, "only" 12-20% still crash
    -   [*The Fuzzing Book*](https://www.fuzzingbook.org/)

---

## Miscellaneous

-   Strong typing catches about 15% of bugs (<a href="#Gao2017">Gao2017</a>)
    -   Which is a lot or a little depending on your point of view
-   Only 6-17% of configuration options are set by most users (<a href="#Xu2015">Xu2015</a>)
    -   Only 2%-8% of parameters are configured by more than 90% of users
-   Secret management is a solved problem
    -   But most developers don't know the solutions (<a href="#Basak2023">Basak2023</a>)
-   Protestware is on the rise (<a href="#Fan2024">Fan2024</a>)
-   Machine learning systems are bloated and vulnerable (<a href="#Zhang2024">Zhang2024</a>)
    -   "Through experimentation with 15 machine learning containers from TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Nvidia,
        we show that bloat accounts for up to 80% of machine learning container sizes,
	increasing container provisioning times by up to 370% and exacerbating vulnerabilities by up to 99%."

## What Hasn't Worked?

-   People have tried explaining all of this before

  <a href="https://neverworkintheory.org/"><strong>https://neverworkintheory.org/</strong></a>
</div>

---

## What Might?

-   Start with a little data science
    -   Using software engineering datasets (because people learn best when examples are relevant)
    -   And Python (because computer science students will probably already know it)
    -   Academically defensible ("Look, math!")
    -   And attractive to students
-   Then replicate a few simple results
-   At this point, students will be able to understand and assess the claims

---

## When We're Done

**Assignment #3**

> Given version control repositories for six software
> projects, determine whether long functions are
> more likely to be buggy than short ones.

-   Requires tool use, model building, and statistics
-   Require students to *do* science
    -   So they *understand* it
    -   So they *value* it

---

## Conclusions

<img src="./wikipedian_protester.png" class="center">

-   The world needs more of this
-   What are you waiting for?
