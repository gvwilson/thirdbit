## Why Should You Listen to Me?

-   Author of five technical books (and two for children)
-   Co-author of three more
-   Editor of six (some of which won awards)
-   Have worked with six publishers
-   I've made mistakes so you don't have to

## Don't Write a Book

-   It's a big undertaking, and it's easy to get discouraged
-   Instead, start blogging regularly
    -   Aim for one thousand-word article per week
    -   If you can't do this, you probably won't finish your book
-   Don't try to write posts in book order
    -   Blog will help you figure that out

---

## Don't Expect to Make a Profit

-   You'll get anything from 12% to 50% royalties from a publisher
    -   Higher percentage if you self-publish…
    -   …but 100% of nothing is nothing
-   Assume a sale price of $50 and sales of a thousand copies, you'll make about $10K
-   It'll take (at least) a few hundred hours to write the book
-   You're almost certainly better off doing contract coding
    -   Or flipping burgers

---

## So Why Bother Writing?

1.  To build your reputation
2.  To give back to the community
3.  Because you enjoy writing

## Read, Then Write

-   Re-read your two favorite technical books
-   Make notes about what their authors did well
    -   Ordering, examples, tone, exercises, …
-   This will give you some ideas for your own book
-   And help you become more conscious of your writing

---

## Don't Try to Be Funny

-   Few jokes are funny the second time
-   Fewer can stand a third re-telling
    -   Unless they're very, very dry
-   And please don't use exclamation marks!
    -   It won't be a surprise the second time around!
    -   And you should let the reader decide if it's exciting!!

---

## Avoid Banal Advice

-   "You should carefully consider users' needs"
    -   Would anyone recommend the opposite?
-   Don't tell me what to think about: tell me what to think
    -   Checklists are useful
    -   But belong in appendices or online

---

## Create Learner Personas

-   A short description of a specific (fictional) individual
-   Create at most two
    -   A book that's meant for everyone is useful to no-one

> Jess started writing VB macros for Excel in a startup and never looked back.
> After spending three years doing front-end JavaScript
> they now want to learn how to build back-end applications,
> but feel insecure about never having studied computer science.
> This material will flesh out their understanding of callbacks, classes, and data structures,
> and teach them some common design patterns.

## Three Kinds of Learners

-   Novice: trying to build a mental model
-   Competent practitioner: wants to fill in gaps in knowledge
-   Expert: wants high-level discussion of tradeoffs and alternatives

<p class="center"><em>No book can serve more than one group well.</em></p>

## Don't Write to Cover Your Ass

-   Dozens of books start with a short intro to XYZ
-   None of these are useful
    -   If your audience knows Python, they don't need a short intro
    -   If they don't, one chapter won't help
-   Authors include these so they can pretend their book is accessible to a wider audience
-   Please don't do this

---

## Don't Compete With the Web

-   Reference manuals were invaluable forty years ago
-   But the world's knowledge is now just a click away
-   You add value by explaining *how* rather than recapitulating *what*
-   And by creating a narrative

---

## Check Your Facts

-   It doesn't matter how well you know your chosen subject
-   Something will have changed since the last time you looked
-   Even if it hasn't, it will in the year it takes you to write your book
-   Stack Overflow <strike>is</strike> was a *great* resource
    -   What questions do people actually have?
    -   What answers do they actually find useful?

---

## Don't Write a General Introduction

-   Unless you're one of the first three to market
-   Focus on a particular aspect: *Python for Web Scraping*
-   Or a particular audience: *R for Sports*
-   Potential audience is smaller…
-   …but you'll reach a much higher fraction…
-   …and a focused book is much easier to write

---

## Publishers

-   Every publisher has a standard proposal form
    -   Who's the audience?
    -   Why are you the right person to write this?
    -   What's the competition and how will you compete?
-   They strongly prefer that you talk to one at a time
-   They need content as much as you need a publisher
    -   If no reputable publisher wants your book,
    maybe you should think about writing something else

---

## Self-Publication

-   Many venues for self-publishing physically or electronically
    -   I use [Lulu](http://lulu.com) and [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/)
-   But then you have to do all your own marketing
    -   It's really hard to shout loud enough to be heard

---

## Agents

-   Unnecessary for technical books
-   Nearly essential for fiction
-   Reputable ones are almost always fully booked
-   A good reason to go to conventions…

---

## Licensing

-   My last few books have been CC-BY-NC
    -   You can use it but *not* (re-)sell it without permission
-   I maintain the HTML version online
    -   Great for errata and incremental improvements
-   [Taylor & Francis](https://www.routledge.com/) has exclusive rights to print and e-book (including PDF)
-   Your mileage will vary

---

## Try It Out

-   No lesson survives first contact with learners
-   So teach your material while it is in draft
    -   At a conference
    -   For a local college or bootcamp
    -   Online
-   If no one signs up, you just learned something useful…

---

## Plan to Iterate

-   No point trying material out unless you act on what you learn
-   Expect to rewrite some pieces two or three times
    -   Often as a result of reorganization
-   If you can't decide whether X comes before Y or vice versa, the odds are that Z has to come before either of them

---

## Drywall, then Paint

-   Get the words and code down
-   *Then* worry about diagrams, citations, glossary, etc.
-   Many of these will disappear during editing
-   There's no point polishing something readers don't ever see

---

## Sketch First

-   Draw diagrams on paper or a whiteboard
    -   Faster and more flexible than any computer drawing tool
    -   Although fingertip apps for tablets are improving quickly
-   Take a picture and use as a placeholder until you're sure
-   Because you're going to iterate *a lot* on diagram

---

## All Authoring Tools Suck

-   Word/Google Docs show you what you're writing…
    -   …but don't play nicely with version control
-   Markdown/LaTeX/notebooks work well with version control…
    -   …but you have to debug your document
-   I've built pipelines for every single book I've worked on

---

## You Need At Least Two Friends

-   Many people will do cursory reviews or one careful read
-   You need people who will read half a dozen sets of changes
-   Thank them in the book

<img src="dog-reading.jpg" alt="Dog Reading" width="30%" longdesc="https://unsplash.com/photos/X1RQ3b6ZhUs" class="center">

---

## Trust Your Editor and Reviewers

-   It doesn't matter if it makes sense to *you*
-   It only matters if it makes sense to *them*
-   So please accept the input of others

> "An author's job is to produce the manure in which an editor grows something worth reading."
>
> — Tom Wilkie

---

## Automate, but Proofread

-   The author's equivalent of "trust, but verify"
-   I can re-run all of the examples in my latest book with a single command
    *and* capture their output *and* insert that output in the manuscript…
-   …but I still have to re-read the discussion around those examples
    to make sure it hasn't fallen out of sync
-   *This is where I <strike>expect</strike> hope generative AI will have the biggest short-term impact*

---

## It's OK to Stop

-   I've started more books than I've finished
    -   The more I wrote, the less I believed they would help their intended audience
-   I've also set books aside for a couple of years and then come back to them
-   *This isn't the same as giving up*

---

## Stop and Ship

-   Your book will never be perfect
-   It will probably never even feel finished
    -   Any more than software does
-   Ship it anyway

---

## Celebrate

-   You'll spot a typo within seconds of receiving the first printed copy
-   Someone you've never met will say something uncomplimentary in a review online
-   Chapter 9 will *never* be as good as you wanted it to be
-   To hell with that:
    be proud of what you built and of who you helped by building it
