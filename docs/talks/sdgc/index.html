## Outline

-   Software has changed everything
-   Often for the worse
    -   Rising inequality
    -   Radicalization
    -   Ubiquitous surveillance
-   Most discussion by technologists is *shallow*
    -   Andreessen's "Techno-Optimist Manifesto" was embarrassing
    -   As was its embrace by equally-ignorant billionaires
-   If we want better answers, we need to:
    -   Decide what to learn
    -   Figure out how to fit it into the curriculcum
    -   Be humble (the "soft" disciplines are harder than ours)

## For Example

-   Petre: ["UML in Practice"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2486788.2486883) (2013)
    -   Careful analysis of structured interviews to determine why people *don't* use UML
-   Steinmacher et al: ["Social Barriers Faced by Newcomers Placing Their First Contribution in Open Source Software Projects"](https://doi.org/10.1145/2675133.2675215) (2015)
    1.  How easy it is to get set up to make a contribution
    1.  How easy it is to find a task to start with
    1.  How warmly first contribution is received
-   Sedano et al: ["Software Development Waste"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icse.2017.20) (2017)
    -   Nine types of waste in software projects, none of which are software issues
-   Hicks: ["It's Like Coding in the Dark"](https://www.catharsisinsight.com/reports) (2022)
    -   Programmers don't learn because they're afraid to reveal ignorance

## Some Surprising Gaps

-   Labor rights
-   Workplace discrimination: less than 8 pages between 12 books
-   Professional liability (or rather, why there isn't any)
-   Regulatory capture
-   Co-operatives and other organizational models

> None of the undergraduate courses on entrepreneurship or the business of software that I looked at
> covered these topics either.

---

## This Isn't "Politics"

-   A reviewer of an early version of this talk said "politics doesn't belong in software engineering courses"
-   But:
    1.  *Not* talking about these, while talking about venture capital and IPOs, is also a "political" decision
    2.  Several of the books we're about to discuss don't align with my personal politics,
        but are still examples of deep thinking and deserve to be taken seriously
    3.  Most of the people who use the word "politics" as an insult would struggle to define it correctly

---

## Why Is This Missing?

-   People in "hard" disciplines tend to look down on the "soft" ones
    -   Until they become managers…

## Abstract

Most young programmers have only ever been exposed to one worldview:
the toxic strain of neoliberal capitalism favored by venture capitalists and their gushing fans in the tech media.
As inequality widens and racist nationalism makes a comeback,
as we do everything in our power to make climate change *worse*
while companies like X, Facebook, and Shopify tie themselves in knots to avoid responsibility for their actions,
most programmers don't have the intellectual tools to understand what's wrong and how we might fix it.

Lots of books give cogent answers to these questions,
but programmers who have never done a civics course
are not going to read nine thousand pages on a whim.
However,
they *might* sit through a one-semester course that explains why the human side of software engineering
is harder than the technical side.
This talk outlines what such a course might cover:
why "flat" organizations make power imbalances worse rather than better,
why discrimination persists despite its economic inefficiency,
how regulatory capture works,
why Americans keep shooting one another,
and what can we learn about big tech by studying drug cartels.
