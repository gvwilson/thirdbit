## Outline

-   Software has changed everything
-   Often for the worse
    -   Rising inequality
    -   Radicalization
    -   Ubiquitous surveillance
    -   And now there's AI to worry about
-   Most discussion by technologists is *shallow*
    -   Andreessen's "Techno-Optimist Manifesto" was embarrassing
-   If we want better answers, we need to:
    1.  Develop a better threat model
    2.  Be humble: the "soft" disciplines are harder than ours
    3.  *Figure out how to get students to care*

    1.  How easy it is to get set up to make a contribution

-   Hicks: ["It's Like Coding in the Dark"](https://www.catharsisinsight.com/reports) (2022)
    -   Programmers don't learn because they're afraid to reveal ignorance

## Threat Model

-   [Therac-25 incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25) and
    [Ariane 5 flight V88](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_flight_V88)
    -   Direct cause-and-effect relationships
    -   But rare and remote

--

-   What now appears to be more relevant:
    -   [Tetraethyl lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraethyllead)
    -   [Asbestos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos) and
        [mesothelioma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesothelioma)
    -   Oxycodone and [Purdue Pharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_Pharma)
    -   The [fossil fuels lobby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuels_lobby)'s campaign
        to promote [climate change denial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_denial)

## Now, How Do We Reach This Guy?

> Jay is 21, white, straight, and male.
> He went into programming because he enjoys solving puzzles,
> and daydreams about being the next Mark Zuckerberg.
> He would deny being racist, homophobic, or misogynist,
> but makes disparaging jokes about "cancel culture" and "DEI hires" to fit in with his peers.
> His favorite phrase in arguments is, "Well, actually…"


--

-   Most programmers know little or nothing about the humanities and social sciences
-   Most material assumes concepts they've never heard of…
    -   …which makes them feel stupid…
    -   …which they hate
-   Many don't even believe there's a problem

## Disappointing Gaps

-   Employees' rights
-   Workplace discrimination: less than 8 pages between 12 books
-   Professional liability: or rather, why there isn't any
-   Co-operatives and other organizational models
-   Regulatory capture

> None of the courses on entrepreneurship or the business of software that I looked at
> covered these topics either.

---

## This Isn't "Politics"

-   A reviewer said "politics doesn't belong in software engineering courses"
-   But *not* talking about these things, while talking about venture capital and IPOs, is a "political" decision
-   Most of the people who use the word "politics" as an insult would struggle to define it correctly
-   "Decision-making in groups in the absence of agreement on goals"

-   This is the worst job market for junior programmers *ever*
-   People whose hopes have failed look for someone to blame
-   If we don't explain how the world works,
    someone much less pleasant will do so

---

## Conclusion (?)

-   My generation squandered the best world we've ever had


--

-   But better *is* possible


--

-   The best thing we can do now is help you learn the things we chose to ignore


--

-   And it's fun (if you skip the boring bits)

## Abstract

Most young programmers have only ever been exposed to one worldview:
the toxic strain of neoliberal capitalism favored by venture capitalists and their gushing fans in the tech media.
As a result,
they don't have the intellectual tools to understand how tech contributes to climate change,
widening inequality,
the resurgence of racist nationalism,
and a host of other problems.

Lots of books offer cogent answers to these questions,
but very few programmers are going to read nine thousand pages on a whim.
However,
they *might* sit through a one-semester course
that introduces a few fundamental ideas,
including why "flat" organizations make power imbalances worse rather than better,
why discrimination persists despite its economic inefficiency,
how regulatory capture works,
and what can we learn about big tech by studying drug cartels.
