<!-- content --><p><em>I&rsquo;m going to ask a favor, but I need to tell a story first.</em></p>
<p>Back in 2017,
in the wake of Trump&rsquo;s first inauguration and the Muslim travel ban,
I tried to get a bunch of people to write a chapter each for
<a href="../../../../ideas/sdgc/">a book</a> that would explain basic ideas in politics, economics, and justice to programmers.
The model had succeeded before:
<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/beautiful-code/9780596510046/"><em>Beautiful Code</em></a>,
<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/making-software/9780596808310/"><em>Making Software</em></a>,
and <a href="https://aosabook.org/"><em>The Architecture of Open Source Applications</em></a>
were all widely read,
so I thought something that covered regulatory capture,
how it is that &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; became &ldquo;property&rdquo;,
why people routinely vote against their own interests,
and so on would find an audience.</p>
<p>The project never really got off the ground.
The programmers who volunteered to help didn&rsquo;t really know the subjects themselves
(though a couple of them tried valiantly to learn as much as they could in a hurry).
As for the social scientists I approached,
they were either too busy with their own projects,
(quite reasonably) wanted to be paid,
or simply didn&rsquo;t know how to talk to people in tech
with essentially no background in the humanities.
Their idea of &ldquo;basic&rdquo; was what they would teach in freshman college course;
unfortunately,
most programmers are at a tenth-grade level
when it comes to understanding how society works.
In fact it&rsquo;s worse than that:
most programmers (including me) know as little about politics and economics
as the average political science major knows about recursion,
but we <em>think</em> we know a lot more.</p>
<p>So here we are eight years later.
I think it&rsquo;s more important than ever
to offer an accessible, compelling alternative
to the self-serving libertarian brogrammer bullshit that is
Silicon Valley&rsquo;s default setting,
but before I break my &ldquo;no new projects&rdquo; rule and try to get something off the ground,
I&rsquo;d like to ask the favor I mentioned at the start of this post.
If you were part of something post-2016 that actually had an impact in tech,
I&rsquo;d be very grateful if you could <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">let me know</a>
what you did,
what it changed,
and how you know.
The Ford Foundation&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/learning-reflections/keeping-those-on-the-front-lines-of-change-safe-five-years-of-the-ford-foundation-grantee-safety-program/">Grantee Safety Program</a> is a great example:
thank you in advance for pointers to others.</p><!-- /content -->
