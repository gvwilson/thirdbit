<!-- content --><p>It&rsquo;s December 4, 1982.
I&rsquo;m eighteen years old
and I&rsquo;m standing in the bus station in Belleville, Ontario
as my bus pulls awayâ€¦</p>
<p>I was on my way back from a visit to Toronto.
Nothing had gone as planned.
In fact,
things had gone so badly that I got off in Belleville to call home (collect)
because I needed to hear a friendly voice.
I didn&rsquo;t realize my bus was leaving until I saw it turn out of the parking lot
and onto the highway.
My bag was on board;
so were my winter coat and my wallet.
I had a couple of bucks in my pocket,
the clothes on my back,
and no idea how I was going to get back to Kingston.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure I started to cry.
I don&rsquo;t actually remember if I did or not,
but I do remember feeling like a complete loser.</p>
<p>I went to the counter and explained my situation to the woman selling tickets.
She was sympathetic,
but said there was nothing she could do,
so I sat down on a bench and tried to figure out what to do.
I could call my parents again,
but what could they do from several thousand kilometers away?</p>
<p>And then a guy I&rsquo;d never met before
came over and handed me a one-way ticket to Kingston he had just bought for me
and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t screw this up.&rdquo;
He walked away and got in a cab before I could thank him or say that I didn&rsquo;t want charity
(although right then I really, really did).</p>
<p>I have no idea who he was,
and as far as I know,
I&rsquo;ve never seen him since.
I can&rsquo;t even really remember his face any more,
but in a way I think I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of the last forty years trying to pay him back.</p>
<p>Time to make another cup of tea.
If you came in peace, be welcome.</p><!-- /content -->
