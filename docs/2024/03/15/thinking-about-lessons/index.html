<!-- content --><p>I&rsquo;m helping a group of programmers put a book together,
so it feels like a good time to revisit the differences between different kinds of lessons.
The classification starts by categorizing stages in learning as:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Unconscious incompetence:</em>
    the person doesn&rsquo;t know what they don&rsquo;t know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Conscious incompetence:</em>
    the person is aware that they don&rsquo;t know things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Conscious competence:</em>
    the person knows how to do something if they focus on doing it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Unconscious competence:</em>
    the person can do things well without having to think them through each time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="center">
<img src="../../../../files/2024/thinking-about-lessons.svg" alt="diagram showing different kinds of learners and lessons">
</div>

<p>This scheme explains why different people need different learning materials:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The first and most important requirement is
    to get people from not knowing what they don&rsquo;t know
    to knowing what they should learn
    <em>and wanting to learn it</em>.
    Intrinsic motivation is the single strongest predictor of learning in neurotypical adults,
    but it&rsquo;s far too easy for traditional classroom-style lectures to <em>demotivate</em> people
    by intimidating them or making them feel that they don&rsquo;t belong.
    The first &ldquo;lesson&rdquo; should therefore make people welcome
    and convince them that they <em>can</em> learn this stuff
    and that doing so will be useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next step is a tutorial,
    i.e.,
    a guided tour of key concepts and ways to use them.
    It&rsquo;s tempting to throw learners straight into projects
    or set them goals and ask them to explore solutions on their own,
    but at this stage in their development,
    most people don&rsquo;t know what questions to ask
    or how to recognize a useful answer when they stumble over one.
    A good learning designer will focus on helping learners construct a mental model
    so that they have somewhere to put their knowledge;
    the two key questions here are,
    &ldquo;How <em>little</em> can I teach?&rdquo; and
    &ldquo;How can learners check that they&rsquo;ve actually understood?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once people have a working mental model of the problem domain
    they are able to start exploring on their own.
    At this point,
    teaching shifts from &ldquo;push&rdquo; (i.e., &ldquo;I know you need to know this next&rdquo;)
    to &ldquo;pull&rdquo; (i.e., &ldquo;Come to me when there&rsquo;s something you can&rsquo;t figure out on your own&rdquo;).
    How-to material like reference manuals, Q&amp;A sites, and online forums
    are more useful at this stage than lessons:
    as I&rsquo;ve said <a href="https://teachtogether.tech/">elsewhere</a>,
    if the instructor keeps pushing after learners are ready to explore
    then learners will be frustrated because things are moving too slowly,
    but if instructors shift to &ldquo;push&rdquo; too early
    then learners will be frustrated because they feel lost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most people stop at conscious competence in most learning domains:
    they become good enough at driving, cooking, or HTML
    to get across town,
    make dinner,
    or fix a web page.
    To go further requires <em>reflective practice</em>:
    the person must try new things and reflect on what worked, what didn&rsquo;t, and why.
    That reflection is much more productive when done with partners,
    so demos, code reviews, master classes, and whiteboarding sessions
    should take the place of <a href="https://gvwilson.github.io/sql-tutorial/">lessons like this</a> or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The final arrow in the diagram above is labelled &ldquo;humility&rdquo;
    because that&rsquo;s what experts need
    to go back to being consciously incompetent in a new domain.
    This is often the hardest step of all:
    after spending years becoming an expert in high-performance computing
    or instructional design,
    it&rsquo;s hard for someone to admit that they don&rsquo;t know anything about
    the psychology of programming
    or the hundred ways in which an interview process can be biased.
    It&rsquo;s the work of a lifetime,
    but learning to bite one&rsquo;s tongue
    is a small price to pay
    for the excitement of everything feeling new again.</p>
