<!-- content --><p>This is not a molecule of acetone:</p>
<p><img class="centered" src="../../../../files/2024/acetone.png" alt="ball-and-stick image of an acetone molecule from Wikipedia"/></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even an accurate representation of a molecule of acetone:
atoms are not little colored balls,
and the bonds between them are not little sticks.
However,
you can explain most practical chemistry using the ball-and-stick model.
More importantly,
if you insist that ten-year-olds have to start with electron shells and quantum chemistry
because they&rsquo;re &ldquo;real&rdquo;,
I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re really interested in teaching them.
Whether you acknowledge it or not,
what you&rsquo;re doing is gatekeeping.</p>
<p>Over the past six months I have tried and failed to get into
several books on ethics in tech,
psychological safety,
the governance of open source projects,
and similar topics that I think are really important in software engineering.
In each case I felt the author was expecting me to dive straight into quantum mechanics.
In particular,
the (many, repeated) off-hand references to work I&rsquo;d never heard of
made me feel like a ten-year-old encountering &ldquo;basic&rdquo; trigonometry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have no grounds for complaint if these books were intended for a scholarly audience:
I don&rsquo;t expect someone who has never programmed
to understand type theory without doing a lot of preparatory work,
so it would be narcissistic to expect advanced topics in other people&rsquo;s disciplines
to be instantly accessible to me
just because I can code.
But the authors of these books clearly thought they were writing for a wider audienceâ€”for
people in tech who wanted to get into ethics, political theory, or group psychology.
They just missed the mark
in the way that I once missed the mark by insisting on explaining hash tables
to a room full of biologists
in their first lesson on Python
because hey,
how can you possibly use dictionaries without understanding how they work?</p>
<p>I think it <em>is</em> possible to write about these things at the ball-and-stick level.
I also think that people who do so
probably encounter the same sniffy reaction from their peers
that I did in the early days of Software Carpentry
(which a senior professor in computer science once dismissed as &ldquo;merely useful&rdquo;).
If you have favorite examples to share,
I&rsquo;d enjoy hearing from you.</p><!-- /content -->
