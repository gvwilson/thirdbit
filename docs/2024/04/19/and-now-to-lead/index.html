<!-- content --><p>As a companion to <a href="../../../../2024/04/18/a-new-stack/">yesterday&rsquo;s post about a new stack</a>,
I would like to introduce you to Jo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jo, 31, completed a PhD in geology three years ago
and now works at a national research laboratory.
The fracture modeling software they wrote in grad school
is being used by a dozen research groups around the world,
several of which have started to contribute fixes and extensions of varying quality.
Jo has just been given the OK to hire two junior research software engineers
to expand the code,
and their graduate supervisor has taken on a new PhD student
to work on it as well.</p>
<p>Jo is comfortable writing thousands of lines of numerical Python code,
branching and merging in Git,
testing with Pytest and the coverage module,
creating and managing issues in GitHub,
running large computational jobs in the cloud using Metaflow,
and turning Jupyter notebooks into publishable PDFs.
Those skills feel necessary but not sufficient
for managing a small, heterogeneous team.
Jo now wants to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to make meetings more productive (or avoid them altogether);</li>
<li>how to decide what people should work on next when stakeholders have different priorities;</li>
<li>how to figure out when features are going to be ready and then deliver them on time;</li>
<li>how to hire people and incorporate them into the team;</li>
<li>how to evaluate people&rsquo;s performance and if necessary let them go;</li>
<li>how to raise awareness of their project in their community; and</li>
<li>how to turn that awareness into stable funding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of all,
though,
Jo wants someone to tell them what else they should be thinking about
and what other skills they should try to acquire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I built and delivered a two-day workshop for people like Jo in 2021–22.
It didn&rsquo;t go well,
partly because I didn&rsquo;t have enough personal experience to draw on at the time,
but also because the practical exercises were unsatisfying.
When I teach <a href="https://gvwilson.github.io/sql-tutorial/">a SQL tutorial</a>,
learners can do 2–5 minute exercises several times an hour to check their understanding
and to motivate clarifying questions.
When I run <a href="../../../../t3/">my workshop on how to teach</a>,
participants do a 5–10 minute exercise every 45 minutes,
which I think works just as well.</p>
<p>When it comes to management skills,
though,
I&rsquo;m really at a loss.
Is there anything that will work at that cadence?
For example,
I&rsquo;ve given a talk on <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HSdgVQjq0d3UYh-aA4uWHXxYYpySn_xXwfn_M4Ms8Ts/">how to run a meeting</a> a dozen times or more
in the past two years.
It has always been well received,
but I don&rsquo;t know what I could have people do in 10 minutes immediately after it
that would actually make a difference to how <em>they</em> run meetings.</p>
<p>Yesterday,
I <a href="../../../../2024/04/18/a-new-stack/">asked</a> what tools should be part of a new stack.
My request today is a bit different:
what practical exercises have you done in whatever training you&rsquo;ve had on managing teams
that actually improved your understanding of how you should do that?
Given my preferred format (one- or two-day workshop delivered in half-day chunks)
I&rsquo;d like things that participants can do in at most 15 minutes,
but &ldquo;actually improved understanding&rdquo; is more important.
If you have suggestions,
please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">email me</a>,
and please accept my thanks in advance.</p>
<p><em>Note:
<a href="https://hbr.org/2016/07/why-diversity-programs-fail">this report</a> by Dobbins and Kalev on why diversity programs fail
highlights the difference between training offered so that people and companies can say,
&ldquo;Well, we told them what they ought to do,&rdquo;
and training that actually changes behavior.
With respect to everyone&rsquo;s good intentions,
I&rsquo;m only interested in the latter.</em></p>
<p><em>Also note:
I now own eight books published in the last six years
on how to be a software engineering manager and/or lead software development teams.
Almost all of their content can be summarized as,
&ldquo;This worked for me,&rdquo;
and/or,
&ldquo;This works if everyone is mature and sincere and their goals are aligned.&rdquo;
None of those books have professional ethics or social responsibility in their index,
and only two of them even mention the fact that
people from marginalized backgrounds usually have a very different experience as first-time managers
than straight, cis, white or Asian, physically able, economically secure men like me.
As you may already have guessed,
I haven&rsquo;t found those books particularly useful…</em></p><!-- /content -->
