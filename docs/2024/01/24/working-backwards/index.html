<!-- content --><p>Here&rsquo;s the last exercise in an introductory programming course for biologists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This zip file contains 236 CSV files,
each of which has readings from a 16x16 microplate.
Some of the plates were calibration runs with no samples in them;
other plates had samples placed in random locations in a handful of wells.
We know that the samples have much higher readings on average than the untreated wells,
but unfortunately we&rsquo;ve lost the records that would tell us which plates were calibration and which we treated.
Write a Python script that:</p>
<ol>
<li>reads the CSV files;</li>
<li>calculates the average reading for each plate; and</li>
<li>classifies the plates into untreated or treated based on the average.</li>
</ol>
<p>Include some tests to convince the examiner that your solution is correct.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s work backward to define the course&rsquo;s curriculum:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read CSV files<ul>
<li>So either <code>sys.argv</code> and enough shell to write <code>python script.py *.csv</code>
    or introduce the <code>glob</code> module</li>
<li>Either way, they&rsquo;re going to have to loop over filenames…</li>
<li>…and read each file into a dataframe</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Calculate the average reading for each plate<ul>
<li>They&rsquo;ll have to combine the dataframes they just read into one big dataframe…</li>
<li>…after pivoting the data to have the four columns (filename, row, col, reading)…</li>
<li>…and then perform a grouped aggregation to calculate the average for each</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Classify the plates<ul>
<li>Either classical statistics (identify the two means of a bimodal distribution)…</li>
<li>…or fancier modern stuff (1-dimensional k-nearest neighbors for k=2)…</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Testing<ul>
<li>Check the values in each dataframe to make sure they didn&rsquo;t mis-read</li>
<li>Generate a bit of synthetic data to test their classifier</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The initial four goals have turned into ten or twelve,
depending on how you count.
We can now come up with a short exercise for each of those
and work backward to discover their prerequisites,
and continue until we get to printing &ldquo;Hello, world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The technique has several names,
but I first learned it as &ldquo;reverse instructional design&rdquo;,
and it brings me to something Cat Hicks posted on Mastodon earlier today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This morning&rsquo;s chats have got me thinking about
an initiative at the Developer Success Lab we&rsquo;ve been talking about
that we&rsquo;re calling Be Your Own Scientist—publishing guidance and teaching
all about helping <em>you</em> bring the power of science
to answer questions about software teams
(and perhaps using it to protect the good stuff you already know you&rsquo;re doing!)</p>
<p>What kinds of topics would you want our team of social scientists to tackle?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I answered:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>How are various kinds of decisions actually made in software engineering organizations?</li>
<li>Why are some specialties seen as higher-status than others, and (how) has that changed over time?</li>
<li>How do developers acquire their understanding of users&rsquo; needs, and what gets lost or garbled in translation?</li>
<li>How do programmers explain things to (a) peers (b) new team members (c) management and (d) users?
    How and why do these differ?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Cat responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Those] sound like research questions rather than teaching people how to answer their own questions?
Good research questions but not quite the same as scientific thinking as a practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to which I tooted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>agreed—what science thinking / techniques would you teach me
so that I could tackle these (or at least understand others&rsquo; answers)?
I think I don&rsquo;t even know what to ask for…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thinking about it some more,
I&rsquo;ve realized that I work backward more often than I&rsquo;d recognized.
I don&rsquo;t know what I need to know,
but I <em>do</em> know what questions I want to (be able to) answer.
Whether it&rsquo;s a lesson on Python,
training on scientific thinking,
or what book to write next,
I often jump ahead to the conclusion I want
and then backtrack to figure out how to get there.
It&rsquo;s not profound or original,
but it works for me.</p><!-- /content -->
