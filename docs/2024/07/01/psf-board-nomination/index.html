<!-- content --><p><em>Update: congratulations to Tania Allard, KwonHan Bae, and Cristi√°n Maureira-Fredes on being elected to the PSF Board.</em></p>
<p>I have put myself forward as a candidate for election to the board of
the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf-landing/">Python Software Foundation</a>.
My pitch is below;
no matter what happens,
I hope I&rsquo;ll be able to continue to serve the community that has given me so much over so many years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Python has been an important part of my life for a quarter of a century,
so I would be grateful for a chance to serve its community as a member of the PSF board.
I believe my experience has prepared me for doing so effectively:
I co-authored the PEP that added sets to the language,
am a Fellow of the PSF,
helped make Python the first-year teaching language at Canada&rsquo;s largest university,
and have written several books showing how to apply it to real-world problems.</p>
<p>I also launched and then led a non-profit organization called Software Carpentry
that now has thousands of instructors running workshops on basic computing skills in dozens of countries.
Building that gave me first-hand experience of the challenges that non-profit organizations face;
I hope that what I learned about fundraising, governance, community management, committee work,
and managing changes in leadership
will allow me to contribute to the PSF in meaningful ways.</p>
<p>My other reason for nominating myself is that I don&rsquo;t like to leave things half-done.
The first generation of open source contributors proved that
volunteers working together can create world-class infrastructure and tools,
but we are still struggling to make such work a viable career.
Many people struggle to balance their desire to contribute with their need to pay their bills,
while other simply burn out.
If elected,
I hope to help the PSF take the lead in tackling the sustainability crisis,
and by doing so,
help ensure that the Python community grows and thrives. </p>
