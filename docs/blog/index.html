  <p>Everyone knows the story:
Lucy keeps telling Charlie Brown he can kick the football and then pulls it away at the last moment,
while Charlie Brown keeps trying because he&rsquo;s just not very smart.
But there are two other versions of the story.
In one,
Charlie Brown knows Lucy will pull the ball away
but keeps trying to kick it
because he has internalized everything people have said about him
and believes repeated disappointment is all he deserves.
In the other,
he&rsquo;s waiting for Lucy to grow bored and ask,
&ldquo;Why do you keep trying?&rdquo;
so that he can say,
&ldquo;Because I love you and am here to help you get past this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the outside, it&rsquo;s hard to tell these stories apart.</p>

  <p><time datetime="2025-01-11" class="post-date">2025-01-11</time></p>
  <p>This series of posts is about course projects designed to prepare students for real jobs.
How companies get this wrong contributes to how they sometimes build things that harm society
(and embarrass their creators).
It easy to avoid these mistakes if you are willing to look beyond the code you write;
that first step is often the hardest,
but I hope this discussion will help.</p>
<h2>How Tech Companies Get Hiring Wrong</h2>
<p>In 1905,
Harvard began selecting students based on their College Entrance Exam Board results.
As a result,
Jewish enrolment began to rise,
and by the early 1920s they made up more than a fifth of the incoming class.
This wasn&rsquo;t an outcome the establishment was willing to accept,
but neither were explicit quotas,
so they moved the goalposts [<a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780618773558">Karabel2006</a>].
Admissions officers began asking questions about the &ldquo;character&rdquo; of prospective students,
and the university began asking for personal essays
that could be graded however the university found most convenient.
By 1933,
the rate of Jewish admission was back down to an &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; 15%.</p>
<p>Harvard&rsquo;s decision to turn away more capable people in favor of less capable ones
seems ridiculous if you think that a university&rsquo;s job is to find and train the smartest people it can.
It makes more sense when you realize that
most institutions&rsquo; first priority is to perpetuate themselves:
if it wasn&rsquo;t,
they probably wouldn&rsquo;t still be around.</p>
<p>Similarly,
the hiring process at many tech companies isn&rsquo;t designed to find the best programmers.
Instead,
it is designed (or more often has just evolved)
to find people who are like those doing the hiring.
&ldquo;Cultural fit&rdquo; almost always means &ldquo;like me&rdquo;:
consciously or not,
we are all biased toward those who look like us,
talk like us,
and make the same pop culture references as us,
which has nothing to do with on-the-job ability
[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-295x.102.1.4">Greenwald1995</a>,<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.riob.2009.10.001">Jost2009</a>].</p>
<p>One way this bias shows up is in whiteboard coding questions about linked lists,
dynamic programming,
and other topics from computer science classes on data structures and algorithms.
As <a href="https://hillelwayne.com/">Hillel Wayne</a> discovered when he looked at <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/linked-lists/">their history</a>,
they might have indicated how much experience someone had using C or Pascal in the 1980s,
but they have no more to do with on-the-job performance today
than the essay questions used by Ivy League schools have to do with your ability to learn.
When April Christina Curley,
a recruiter at Google,
began coaching Black students how to prepare for interviews with Google that included questions like these,
the company shut her downâ€”even though
schools like Stanford had been running coaching sessions for their students for years [<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/04/google-hbcu-recruiting/">Tiku2021</a>].</p>
<p>[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/VLHCC.2019.8818836">Behroozi2019</a>,<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3377815.3381372">Behroozi2020a</a>,<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3368089.3409712">Behroozi2020b</a>]
summarize many other things that often go wrong in hiring in tech,
from long delays waiting for feedback
to asking candidates to spend several days working for free on programming assignments.
These aren&rsquo;t just signs of dysfunctional company culture:
they also make hiring harder for some people than others.
For example,
a single parent or someone caring for a relative with chronic illness
may not be able to devote ten hours to an unpaid side project.
If the interview process requires that,
the company is effectively selecting for people who are economically secure and have lots of free time,
which doesn&rsquo;t correlate with how well they can program in a full-time job.</p>
<div class="callout">
<p><strong>A sign of privilege</strong></p>
<p>You probably won&rsquo;t be treated with any more respect on the job than you were while interviewing.
However, when suggested in an early draft of this post that,
&ldquo;If a company does any of these things, go find another one,&rdquo;
one reviewer replied,
&ldquo;It must be nice to be able to walk away.&rdquo;
They were right:
most people aren&rsquo;t as financially secure as me,
so they aren&rsquo;t able to be as finicky about who they work for as I am.
In other words,
I made the same mistake as a team lead who assumed that
since their evenings and weekends were theirs to do with as they wished,
everyone else&rsquo;s would be too.</p>
</div>
<p>As a student looking for your first full-time job
you probably won&rsquo;t have any control over the hiring process,
but seeing whether the company does it well or not
gives you valuable information about how well run it is.
Here are a few positive indicators:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Write inclusive, accessible job ads.</dt>
<dd>[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/a0022530">Gaucher2011</a>] is just one of many studies showing
that gendered wording in job ads reinforces gender inequality in male-dominated occupations.
<a href="http://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/">Gender Decoder</a> and <a href="http://gendermag.org/">GenderMag</a> can help you find bugs like this
in ads and software [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3377811.3380371">Hilderbrand2020</a>].
Tools for finding and eliminating racial bias and other problems aren&rsquo;t as common,
but [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3366792">Washington2020</a>] will tell you what to aim for,
and if <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WebAIM WAVE</a> doesn&rsquo;t give your online job ads a clean bill of health,
please fix the accessibility problems it reports.</dd>
<dt>Post a public description of the hiring process.</dt>
<dd>Does the company share a page with you (or an email)
that lays out what&rsquo;s going to happen in what order,
how much time is expected,
and the principles everything is based on?</dd>
<dt>Use blinded screening.</dt>
<dd>Everyone has implicit biases,
and many of the rules scientists follow when running experiments are designed
to prevent such biases contaminating their results.
The same is true of hiring;
for example,
companies should redact things like a candidate&rsquo;s age, race, and gender
when circulating resumes for internal review.</dd>
<dt>Use diverse interview panels.</dt>
<dd>Giving people from under-represented backgrounds a say in who&rsquo;s hired next
gives other people with similar backgrounds a better chance of being treated fairly.</dd>
<dt>Have candidates solve realistic problems with their preferred tools.</dt>
<dd>Most programmers have laptops,
and video calls are now a part of everyday life in industrialized countries,
so there&rsquo;s no reason <em>not</em> to give people an hour to show what they can do using the IDE of their choice.
There is also no reason to stop them using online search or AI tools while they do this:
every working programmer relies on our external collective memory,
so telling a candidate they can&rsquo;t during an interview
is like telling a chef to make a meal without using saucepans or knives.</dd>
</dl>
<p>These guidelines apply to school and courses as well.
Are course descriptions and course websites inclusive?
Are instructors required to use blinded grading to ensure that personal likes and dislikes don&rsquo;t affect grades?
If the answers are &ldquo;no&rdquo;, what can you and your classmates do to fix things?</p>
<div class="callout">
<p><strong>Questions to ask</strong></p>
<p>I have interviewed people who didn&rsquo;t ask a single question about the company,
what an average day would look like, or how their career might evolve.
<a href="https://jvns.ca/">Julia Evans</a> has a good list of <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2013/12/30/questions-im-asking-in-interviews/">questions to ask in interviews</a>,
and <a href="https://another.rodeo/">T. Carter Baxter</a> has <a href="https://github.com/tBaxter/questions-for-employers">another</a>.
There won&rsquo;t be time to get to them all,
but asking two or three will impress your interviewer
as well as giving you valuable information.</p>
</div>
<h2>On the Job</h2>
<p>Unfair treatment doesn&rsquo;t end after people are hired.
Study after study has shown that men and women are treated differently on the job:
women have to work twice as hard to be given half as much credit,
they are listened to less often or given less credit for new ideas,
and what is seen as confidence in men is seen as pushiness or stridency in women [<a href="https://hbr.org/2017/12/what-research-tells-us-about-how-women-are-treated-at-work">Gavett2017</a>].
People of color are undermined and discounted in the same way in majority-white workplaces in Europe and North America,
and discrimination based on race, faith, and caste are endemic in the rest of the world as well.</p>
<p>Many companies have taken steps to remedy this during hiring.
However,
hiring more people from under-represented groups doesn&rsquo;t make a difference
if they have to work twice as hard to be taken half as seriously,
if they are constantly passed over for promotion,
or if discussions about promotion continue to take place in the men&rsquo;s locker room
after the department&rsquo;s Friday afternoon hockey game.
There are no easy fixes to these problems,
but there are things you can ask for even as a junior hire:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Share data on how well the company has been doing recently.</dt>
<dd>It&rsquo;s reasonable to ask what proportion of a company&rsquo;s staff (technical and otherwise)
come from under-represented backgrounds
and about the average length of stay at the company.
If the interviewer doesn&rsquo;t know the answer,
they should be able to get it;
if the company doesn&rsquo;t have that data or won&rsquo;t share it,
you&rsquo;ve just learned something.
(However,
see the note above about my privilege:
I can afford to make an interviewer uncomfortable
in a way that most juniors looking for their first job cannot.)</dd>
<dt>Have an org chart.</dt>
<dd>As I said when talking about <a href="../2025/01/06/making-decisions/">making decisions</a>,
every organization has a power structure:
the only question is whether it&rsquo;s public and accountable
or whether the organization runs on who you know and how willing people are to barge in on strangers.</dd>
<dt>Have written criteria for performance reviews.</dt>
<dd>This is a legal requirement in many places,
and these are something a company can share before hiring you.
(Asking for them is a good way to impress interviewers.)
If a company doesn&rsquo;t have criteria,
or if performance reviews are only done when an employee asks for one,
the system is once again biased toward extroverts and the well-connected.</dd>
<dt>Specify how much time employees can take off.</dt>
<dd>Some tech companies have an &ldquo;unlimited vacation&rdquo; policy,
meaning that employees can take as much time off as they want as long as their work gets done.
This sounds attractive,
but <a href="https://library.namely.com/hr-mythbusters-2017">people actually take <em>less</em> time off</a> under these policies
than the legal minimum in most jurisddictions,
both because they feel guilty and because they worry about taking too much.
It also saves companies money:
the company has to compensate people for unused vacation days if the person is laid off,
but not if there&rsquo;s no target.</dd>

      Grades
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2025-01-10" class="post-date">2025-01-10</time></p>
  <p>Many organizations make the mistake of focusing on outputs rather than on outcomes
[<a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781491973790">Perri2018</a>].
In software companies,
this usually takes the form of measuring progress by the number of features added to a product
rather than by whether changes to the product are actually making people&rsquo;s lives easier.
The equivalent mistake in a project course is to focus on writing lots of code
instead of on what the grading scheme will actually reward,
so once you have <a href="@root2025/01/07/forming-teams/">formed a team</a> and figured out <a href="@root2025/01/08/division-of-labor/">who&rsquo;s doing what</a>,
it&rsquo;s time to figure out how the work will be assessed.</p>
<p>Courses with names like &ldquo;Senior Thesis Project&rdquo; or &ldquo;Computer Science Capstone&rdquo;
generally share three characteristics [<a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781852333577">Fincher2001</a>,<a href="https://leanpub.com/teachingteamcollaboration">Scharlau2023</a>]:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Learning how to work in a team is an explicit goal
    (versus courses in which
    you work in a team but are not taught how to do so).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your grade depends on how you work as well as what you build.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are supposed to work as if you were trying to meet the needs of a real customer.
    You might start with a blank sheet of paper
    or have to fix and extend an existing application,
    but you and your team are responsible for some or all of
    requirements analysis,
    design,
    implementation,
    testing,
    documentation,
    packaging,
    deployment,
    handoff,
    and review.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="callout">
<p><strong>Move along</strong></p>
<p>One goal of project courses is to move learners from left to right in
the learning model shown below.
The instructor&rsquo;s job is to mentor rather than to lecture;
most of the learning will take place in the team or on your own.
Putting it another way,
a project course is where your school starts treating you like a competent practitioner
rather than like a novice.</p>
<p><img src="../files/2025/four-models-of-instruction.svg" alt="four models of instruction"></p>
</div>
<p>Your grade in a project course is typically based on:</p>
<dl>
<dt>The software you produce.</dt>
<dd>Does it build and run?
Does it meet the customer&rsquo;s requirements (or the instructor&rsquo;s specifications if you don&rsquo;t have a real customer)?
Is the source code readable?
Is the program efficient?
(Using an exponential algorithm instead of one that runs in linear time certainly <em>ought</em> to cost you marksâ€¦)</dd>
<dt>The process you followed.</dt>
<dd>Some instructors insist you use a traditional analyze-design-code-test methodology.
Others structure the course around short sprints (typically a couple of weeks long)
during which you refactor the application,
extend it,
test your changes,
and deploy the new version.</dd>
<dt>A final report.</dt>
<dd>This may be a handoff report
(i.e., documentation to help whoever inherits the software from you get up to speed),
a summary of your experiences,
or some combination thereof.</dd>
<dt>A final exam.</dt>
<dd>This may focus on the theoretical side of the course
(&ldquo;Describe the four main functions of Quality Assuranceâ€¦&rdquo;)
but smart instructors will include some questions to test your understanding of the project
in order to determine who actually did the work and who was just along for the ride.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="callout">
<p><strong>Give me good newsâ€”lie if you have to</strong></p>
<p>As pointed out previously,
<a href="@root2025/01/03/time-management/">time management</a> is harder for students than for professionals in industry
because students typically have four or five bosses who don&rsquo;t coordinate deadlines with each other.
Asking students to follow a particular process like waterfall or agile
is therefore functionally equivalent to asking them to lie:
they simply aren&rsquo;t going to be able to spend a couple of hours every day on this project
<em>and</em> meet their other commitments.
A fair grading scheme should take that into account.</p>
</div>
<p>Here are some of the things that students might be required to produce:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Requirements analysis</dt>
<dd>What the problem is, who the stakeholders are (i.e., who wants the problem
solved), and what their needs are.</dd>
<dt>Design</dt>
<dd>What the user interface should look like, how data will flow through the
system, what its major modules will be, and how they&rsquo;ll interact.</dd>
<dt>Application code</dt>
<dd>The software that will be delivered to the end user.  This is inextricably
entangled with:</dd>
<dt>Test code</dt>
<dd>Coding and testing should not be separate activities: doing them
concurrently greatly improves your project&rsquo;s chances of success.</dd>
<dt>Documentation</dt>
<dd>Human-readable explanations of the software&rsquo;s structure and use.  The first
is intended for whoever inherits the software from you; the second, for its
users.  It is almost always a mistake to try to combine the two or to write
them as if they were going to be read by the same people.</dd>
<dt>Packaging</dt>
<dd>A program is a piece of software that runs for you on your machine.  A
product is a piece of software that will run for anyone on <em>their</em> machine.
Products take longer to build than programs: the packaging needed to let
someone else download, install, configure, and run the program has often not
been covered in software engineering courses, but good instructors will
insist that you create it.</dd>
<dt>Deployment</dt>
<dd>These days the project&rsquo;s aim might not be to create something that can be
downloaded and installed.  Instead, its aim might be to create a web site or
web service or make something else directly available to users.  Like
packaging, deployment can be a major development issue in its own right, and
the effort required to do it is almost always underestimated.</dd>
<dt>Handoff</dt>
<dd>If you don&rsquo;t put effort into passing the project on to whoever comes after
you, your hard work will almost certainly count for nought.  While it isn&rsquo;t
usual for undergraduate projects to be handed on from one term to another,
some courses require teams to swap code mid-term.  If this happens,
instructors may grade you on how complete and up-to-date your wiki pages,
bug database, and build scripts are at the time of handoff.</dd>
<dt>Review</dt>
<dd>The only way to get better at something is to reflect on how you&rsquo;ve done and
what you could have done better.  Every project should therefore end with a
postmortem in which team members talk about what went right and what went
wrong.  As mentioned earlier, this may then be the subject of the final
report.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long list,
and in my experience it isn&rsquo;t practical to try to grade all of these,
since you wind up with things being worth just a few percent of the overall result.
In the past,
students have found something more granular works better:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Warmup exercise (0%)</dt>
<dd>The warmup exercise takes up the first week; its purpose is to give students a
chance to familiarize themselves with the problem domain, tools, and
software they&rsquo;ll be using for the rest of the term, and to propose a grading
scheme for the rest of their work. This exercise isn&rsquo;t graded in itself,
but lays the foundation for everything that is.</dd>
<dt>Code (20%)</dt>
<dd>Yes, that&rsquo;s right: the code is only worth 20% of the final grade, even
though it&rsquo;s where students spend the bulk of their time.  I do this because
(1) if you don&rsquo;t know how to program you shouldn&rsquo;t be in this course and (2)
if you don&rsquo;t create some code you can&rsquo;t test, do a demo, or write your final
report.</dd>
<dt>Testing (20%)</dt>
<dd>Testing is just as important as coding, so it&rsquo;s given the same weight.
Note, though, that only automated tests count: if I can&rsquo;t check the project
out of version control and re-run the tests (possibly after editing a
configuration file) then as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, the code hasn&rsquo;t been
tested.</dd>
<dt>Demos (20%)</dt>
<dd>I used to require students to prepare a 20-minute lecture on a topic of
their choosing and deliver it to their coursemates or a junior class.  It
was a valuable experience, but it ate up a lot of time, so I switched to
having students do 10-minute demos instead.  I usually give students two
shots at this: one after which their peers give them feedback, and a second
that&rsquo;s actually graded.  This is valuable practice for job interviews and a
good reality check on how much progress has actually been made.</dd>
<dt>Teamwork (20%)</dt>
<dd>Everyone starts with 10 out of 10; marks come off if you always do your work
at the last moment, check in code that breaks the build, or are
disrespectful.</dd>
<dt>Final state of project (20%)</dt>
<dd>Most of my projects carry forward from term to term and team to team, so I
award one fifth of the overall mark based on the state each team leaves the
project in.  Does everything build?  Have issues been filed for all known
bug?  Does the README explain how to install the code, and do those
instructions actually work?</dd>

      Managing Conflict

  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2025-01-09" class="post-date">2025-01-09</time></p>
  <p>You just missed an important deadline, and people are unhappy.
The sick feeling in the pit of your stomach has turned to anger:
you did <em>your</em> part,
but Sylvie didn&rsquo;t finish her stuff until the very last minute,
which meant that no one else had time to spot the two big mistakes she&rsquo;d made,
and Surinder didn&rsquo;t deliver at all.
If something doesn&rsquo;t change, you&rsquo;re going to fail this course.</p>
<p>Conflicts like this come up all the time.
We can deal with them in four ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Cross our fingers and hope that things will get better on their own,
    even though they didn&rsquo;t the last three times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do extra work to make up for others&rsquo; shortcomings.
    This strategy avoids the stress of confronting others in the short run,
    but the time for that &ldquo;extra&rdquo; has to come from somewhere.
    Sooner or later,
    our personal lives or other responsibilities will suffer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lose our temper.
    People often displace anger into other parts of their lives:
    they may yell at someone for taking an extra few seconds to make coffee
    when what they really need to do is tell their teammates that
    they aren&rsquo;t going to miss another dinner with their family
    in order to clean up a mess that someone else made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix the underlying problem.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of us find the first option easiest,
even though it doesn&rsquo;t fix the problem.
The fourth option is harder because we don&rsquo;t like confrontation.
Managed properly, though, it can be much less bruising,
which means that we don&rsquo;t have to be as afraid of it.
And if people believe that we will take steps when they lie,
bully,
procrastinate,
or do a half-assed job,
they will often avoid making it necessary.</p>

<p><strong>A few bad apples</strong></p>
<p>An internal study at Facebook in 2021 found that
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/14/facebook-vaccine-hesistancy-qanon/">just over 100 people were the source of almost half of harmful disinformation about COVID-19 vaccination</a>.
Similarly, one of the designers of the game <em>Ultima Online</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/ZenOfDesign/status/1371347166736834560">reported</a>,
&ldquo;â€¦we asked players what percentage of the player base were degenerate player killers.
Players responded with 10%.
The metrics told us the answer was closer to 0.1%.&rdquo;
These findings and many others tell us that
a small number of people cause a disproportionate amount of grief in our communities (online and otherwise),
and that they seem much more common than they are
because incidents of abuse and conflict loom large in our memories.</p>
<p>The irony is that <em>The Walking Dead</em> and <em>Mad Max</em> have it completely backward:
when a real disaster strikes, most people actually rise to the occasion.
As [<a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780143118077">Solnit2010</a>] describes,
neighbors don&rsquo;t turn on each other in the aftermath of an earthquake or a hurricane.
Instead,
they are more likely to look out for each other than under normal circumstances.
That doesn&rsquo;t make for exciting viewing, though,
and the powerful have always wanted the rest of us to believe that
the only alternative to their rule is chaos.</p>
</div>
<h2>What to Do</h2>
<p>The first rule for <a href="../2025/01/04/meetings/">meetings</a> was to agree on what the rules are
so that everyone knows what&rsquo;s expected of them.
A shared understanding of how to handle conflict helps in the same way:
as with first aid training,
having some idea of what to do makes you more likely to act when the time comes.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Make sure you are not guilty of the same sin.</dt>
<dd>You won&rsquo;t get very far complaining about someone else interrupting in meetings
if you do it just as frequently.</dd>
<dt>Check expectations.</dt>
<dd>Are you sure the offender knows what standards they are supposed to be meeting?</dd>
<dt>Check the situation.</dt>
<dd>Is someone dealing with an ailing parent or immigration woes?
Do they have deadlines for three other projects that we don&rsquo;t know about?
Use open questions like, &ldquo;Can you help me understand this?&rdquo; when checking in.
This gives them the freedom to explain something you may not have expected
and avoids the pressure of being asked directly about something they don&rsquo;t want to discuss.</dd>
<dt>Document the offense.</dt>
<dd>Write down what the offender has actually done and why it&rsquo;s not good enough.
Doing this helps you clarify what you&rsquo;re upset about
and is essential if you have to escalate.</dd>
<dt>Check with other team members.</dt>
<dd>Are you alone in feeling that the offender is letting the team down?
If so, you aren&rsquo;t necessarily wrong,
but it&rsquo;ll be a lot easier to fix things if you have the support of the rest of the team.
Finding out who else on the team is unhappy can be the hardest part of the whole process:
you can&rsquo;t even ask the question without letting on that you are upset,
and word will almost certainly get back to whoever you are asking about,
who might then accuse you of stirring up trouble.</dd>
<dt>Talk with the offender.</dt>
<dd>This should be a team effort:
put it on the agenda for a meeting,
present the complaint,
and make sure that the offender understands it.
This is sometimes enough to solve the problem:
if someone realizes that they&rsquo;re going to be held accountable,
they will often change their ways.</dd>
<dt>Escalate as soon as there&rsquo;s a second offense.</dt>
<dd>People who don&rsquo;t have good intentions count on us giving them one last chance after another
until the project is finished and they can go suck the life out of their next victim.
<em>Don&rsquo;t fall into this trap.</em>
If someone stole your laptop,
you would report it right away.
If someone steals your time,
it&rsquo;s foolish to give them a chance to do it again and again.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In a course project,
&ldquo;escalation&rdquo; means &ldquo;taking the issue to the instructor&rdquo;.
Of course,
they have probably had dozens of students complain to them over the years
about teammates not doing their share,
and it isn&rsquo;t uncommon to have both halves of a pair say that they&rsquo;re doing all the work.
In order to get them to take you seriously and help you fix the problem,
you should send them an email signed by several people
that describes what&rsquo;s happened and the steps already taken.
Make sure the offender gets a copy as well,
and ask the instructor to arrange a meeting to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>One technique your instructor may ask you to use in a meeting of this kind is <em>active listening</em>.
When one person makes a point,
the person on the other side of the issue explains it back to them,
as in,
&ldquo;So what I think Igor is saying isâ€¦&rdquo;
This confirms that the second person has actually paid attention to what the first person said,
and can defuse a lot of tension,
since explaining your position clearly forces the other person to see the world through your eyes,
if only for a few moments.</p>
<div class="callout">
<p><strong>Hitchhikers</strong></p>
<p>Hitchhikers who show up but never actually do anything are particularly difficult to manage,
in part because they are usually very good at appearing reasonable.
They will nod as you present our case, then say, &ldquo;Well, yes, butâ€¦&rdquo;
and list a bunch of minor exceptions
or cases where others on the team have also fallen short of expectations.
Tracking progress and contributions is essential for handling them.
If you can&rsquo;t back up your complaint,
the instructor may be left with the impression that the whole team is dysfunctional.</p>
</div>
<p>Finally, it&rsquo;s important to recognize that good principles sometimes conflict [<a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780374527174">Berlin2000</a>].
For example,
suppose that a student has a medically diagnosed attention disorder
that requires them to talk to themselves quite loudly while programming in order to stay focused,
but other members of their team find this very distracting.
Asking the student in question to program somewhere else
would be punishing them for something they can&rsquo;t control,
while asking everyone else to put on headphones would make their interaction more difficult
and their work less fun.
There might not be a solution that satisfies everyone;
in such cases, the best guide is to do the kindest thing possible.</p>
<h2>Escalation</h2>
<p>What can you do if conflict becomes more personal and heated?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Be short, simple, and firm.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Don&rsquo;t try to be funny.</em>
    It almost always backfires, or will later be used against you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Play for the audience.</em>
    You probably won&rsquo;t change the mind of the person you are calling out,
    but you might change the minds or strengthen the resolve of people who are observing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Pick your battles.</em>
    You can&rsquo;t challenge everyone, every time,
    without exhausting yourself and deafening our audience.
    An occasional sharp retort will be much more effective than constant criticism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Call things what they are.</em>
    For example,
    don&rsquo;t call someone stupid when what you really mean is that they&rsquo;re racist or homophobic.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://captainawkward.com/">Captain Awkward</a> and <a href="https://www.askamanager.org/">Ask a Manager</a>
have useful advice for discussions like these,
and <a href="https://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Charles%27_Rules_of_Argument">Charles&rsquo; Rules of Argument</a> are very useful online.</p>
<h2>Starting Over</h2>
<p>Sometimes the problem isn&rsquo;t just one person;
sometimes, the whole team is dysfunctional.
In the mid-1990s,
for example,
I worked in a data visualization startup.
Individually, we were all smart, decent people.
Put us all in a room, though,
and our IQs seemed to cancel out
so that collectively we were as dumb as a sack full of hammers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a lot you can do in cases like this except start over.
Instructors can allow for this by announcing at the start of the course
that teams will be dissolved and re-formed halfway through the project
unless every member on the team submits a separate signed request to stay together.
There&rsquo;s a bit of psychology here:
if people are required to ask for their team to be dissolved,
they will often think it&rsquo;s more trouble than it&rsquo;s worth.
If dissolution is the default,
though,
then students will be less inhibited.</p>
<p>Students also usually understand that
dissolving their team and forming a new one takes time
that could be invested in earning a higher grade.
In practice,
therefore,
teams usually stick together if they see that troublemakers are actually being dealt with.</p>
<div class="callout">
<p><strong>Who gets to keep the cat?</strong></p>
<p>If the instructor allows or requires teams to re-form partway through the project,
they should explain at the start of the course what will happen
to the work the team has done up to that point.
Can each member of the team that is dissolving
use everything the whole team has built up to that point?
Do they have to re-start with whatever has been written by the teams they are joining?
Knowing this in advance helps everyone decide whether breaking up is worth it.</p>

      Division of Labor
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2025-01-08" class="post-date">2025-01-08</time></p>
  <p>All right, you&rsquo;ve <a href="../2025/01/07/forming-teams/">formed a team</a>:
now what?
How do you decide who does what?
How do you make sure that everyone actually does what they&rsquo;re supposed to?
And most importantly, how do you do this fairly?</p>
<p>Some jobs have higher social status than others,
and what is or isn&rsquo;t considered important
usually reflects racial and gender divides within societyâ€”so much so that
sociologists use the phrase &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_work">women&rsquo;s work</a>&rdquo; to describe the phenomenon.
It is also known as &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_issues_faced_by_black_quarterbacks">quarterback syndrome</a>&rdquo;:
two thirds of NFL players overall in the United States are Black,
but only 17% of quarterbacks,
which is the position on a team with the highest social status.</p>
<p>Among programmers,
writing operating systems or other software that is close to the hardware
has higher status than building user interfaces;
people doing the former are both paid more and more likely to be male
than people doing the latter,
regardless of ability or value delivered to the employer.
This creates a feedback loop:
white and Asian men pursue certain career paths because they have high status
(they want to be &ldquo;real programmers&rdquo;),
and the fact that they are pursuing those careers is what maintains their higher status.
It also creates a confirmation loop:
since women and people of color get fewer chances to do certain tasks,
they are less good at them,
which &ldquo;confirms&rdquo; the initial bias.</p>
<p>All of this starts in the classroom.
In mixed-gender teams,
for example,
female students are more likely to be given responsibility for taking notes,
writing documentation,
and other low-status tasks.
Some have experienced this so often that they have come to accept it as
the price they have to pay for being in tech.
Others protest, but those who do are often dismissed as being &ldquo;difficult&rdquo;.
Many take a third path and decide to leave programmingâ€”after all,
why play a game that&rsquo;s unfair?</p>
<div class="callout">
<p><strong>In the beginning</strong></p>
<p>Programming was originally considered a female occupation,
but as it became more lucrative it came to be viewed as &ldquo;naturally&rdquo; male.
[<a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780262534536">Abbate2012</a>] and [<a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780262517966">Ensmenger2012</a>] describe how this happened,
while [<a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780262535182">Hicks2018</a>] looks at how Britain lost its early dominance in computing
by systematically discriminating against its most qualified workers:
women.
Some men become quite uncomfortable whenever this is brought up,
but we need to learn how to discuss our own history
if we want to be able to think clearly about how the things we&rsquo;re doing today
might change society tomorrow.</p>
</div>
<p>There are many ways to divide project work between team members,
but no matter how you do it,
the software you get will reflect the division of labor
(a phenomenon known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_law">Conway&rsquo;s Law</a>
or socio-technical congruence [<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1414004.1414008">Cataldo2008</a>]).
In a <em>modular decomposition</em>,
each person is responsible for one part of the program.
For example,
one person might design and build the GUI
while another writes the database interface
and a third implements the business rules.
Having people own parts of the code like this produces lower failure rates in industry [<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2025113.2025119">Bird2011</a>],
but is generally a bad strategy in a course project:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It leads to <em>big bang integration</em>
    in which all the components meet each other for the first time
    right at the end of the project.
    Big bang almost always fails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each team member only really understands one aspect of the project,
    which often proves fragile.
    (Imagine what happens if someone gets sick or drops the courseâ€¦)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It increases the risk of people from marginalized groups being assigned lower-status work,
    since self-appointed alpha geeks will usually snag jobs like architecture and coding,
    leaving less appealing work to people who aren&rsquo;t as pushy, privileged, or self-confident.
    This tends to reinforce existing inequities;
    it also tends to lower the team&rsquo;s overall grade,
    since there&rsquo;s often little relationship between how outspoken people are
    and how well they work.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With <em>functional decomposition</em>,
each person is responsible for one type of task,
i.e.,
one person does the testing,
another handles the documentation,
a third does the bulk of the coding,
and the fourth takes care of build and deployment.
This strategy has the same drawbacks as modular decomposition.</p>
<p>I therefore recommend that student teams use <em>feature decomposition</em>:
instead of owning an entire subsystem for the life of the project,
each team member handles the design, coding, testing, and documentation of one feature.
There isn&rsquo;t as much need for close collaboration between students
as there is with the previous two strategies,
but feature decomposition is more robust and more equitable.</p>
<p>Any of these strategies is better than <em>chaotic decomposition</em>,
which unfortunately is the most common approach.
If people have different ideas about who&rsquo;s supposed to do what,
some things won&rsquo;t be done at all while others will be done several times over.
(You can tell if your decomposition is chaotic by counting how often people say,
&ldquo;I thought <em>you</em> were doing that!&rdquo; or &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve already done that!&rdquo;)
All other decompositions tend toward chaos under pressure,
so it&rsquo;s important to establish rules early
and stick to them when the going is easy
so that the instinct to do the right thing will be there
when mid-terms other deadlines strike.</p>
<div class="callout">
<p><strong>Clarity</strong></p>
<p>No matter how you allocate work, make sure that everyone understands who is doing what, when.
As [<a href="https://peerj.com/articles/cs-241/">Barke2019</a>] found,
actual roles can be fluid;
what matters most is that team members understand and accept their responsibilities
and everyone else&rsquo;s at any particular moment.</p>

      Forming Teams
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2025-01-07" class="post-date">2025-01-07</time></p>
  <p>Most people learn better together than they do on their own [<a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781579220860">Michaelson2004</a>].
As long as their teams work well they achieve higher grades,
retain information longer,
are less likely to drop out of school,
and graduate with better communication skills
and a better understanding of what will be expected of them in their subsequent careers.</p>
<p>But that &ldquo;as long as&rdquo; is important.
A badly-run team is worse than no team at all,
since people will waste hours or days arguing with one another,
duplicating or undoing each other&rsquo;s work,
and wishing that they had gone into gardening instead.
These conflicts are more wearying than any number of buffer overruns or accidentally erased files,
which is why most computer science courses stick to individual assignments.
It doesn&rsquo;t take much to make a team work smoothly, though.
The rules for running meetings <a href="../2025/01/04/meetings/">posted earlier</a> are a good start;
this post looks at a few other things you can do,
and [<a href="https://www.ijee.ie/1atestissues/Vol35-6B/05_ijee3838.pdf">Parker2019</a>] goes into more detail.</p>
<div class="callout">
<p><strong>Team size</strong></p>
<p>I once heard an anthropologist ask, &ldquo;How big is a sports team?&rdquo;
When people said it depends on the sport,
she explained that in fact they all have about half a dozen members.
Anything larger than that splits into smaller groups:
the forwards and backs in rugby,
the infield and outfield in baseball,
and so on.
She went on to explain that hunting parties in non-agricultural societies are usually that size as well,
as are basic military units around the world
(a platoon is two squads of six people).
Since we can only keep a handful of things in our short-term memory at once,
that&rsquo;s as big as a team can practically be.</p>
<p>The same rule applies to software development.
Three or four people can work tightly on a single piece of code,
but when there are more they define some interfaces and develop in parallel.
Tools like GitHub help groups coordinate more effectively,
but the groups themselves stay the same size.</p>
</div>
<p>Teams of three to five provide a good balance between skills and accountability.
A team of two may not have enough breadth and background to tackle a large piece of work;
more importantly,
one or the other person is likely to take a dominant role.
If you put six or eight people in a team,
on the other hand,
you may not be able to divide up the work
in a way that will keep everyone engaged and busy.
Teams that size or larger also make scheduling meetings much more difficult
and increase the odds that at least one member will be a hitchhiker.</p>
<p>Many students prefer to select their teammates,
and students with high grades tend to want teammates with a similar profile.
[<a href="https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/josotl/article/view/24128">Post2020</a>] found that matching students by grade led to a small improvement in outcomes,
with a larger impact on team grades than on individual ones.
he same study found that members of self-selected teams
were more likely to already have friends on their team,
but that this was <em>negatively</em> correlated with outcomes
(possibly because people are less willing to hold friends accountable for missed work).</p>
<p>One surprising finding is that having students with a range of grades in the same team
either has no effect or improves outcomes for everyone
[<a href="https://www.lifescied.org/doi/10.1187/cbe.17-12-0283">Donovan2018</a>,<a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002945923015395">Farland2019</a>,<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9274203">Auvinen2020</a>].
It&rsquo;s easy to see how this benefits teams of weak students:
they are likely to get coaching from their stronger teammates.
One theory for why it also helps stronger students is that
the best way to learn something is to explain it to someone else;
bringing a weaker teammate up to speed will usually do more for your grade
than spending those same hours hacking or reading.</p>
<p>In my experience,
teams of strong students are also more likely to use a divide and conquer strategy,
effectively reducing the project to a set of parallel sub-projects handled by one person each.
This may feel more efficient,
but most of the benefits of working in a team are lost:
there&rsquo;s less back-and-forth discussion of design issues
and little improvement in communication skills.
Those may not be important to you at first,
but if there is a final exam in your course with questions about the project work,
your mark on it may depend on how much you know about your teammates&rsquo; work.</p>
<p>The most powerful argument for instructors selecting teams,
though,
is that&rsquo;s how it works in the real world.
You probably won&rsquo;t get to pick your colleagues if you join a company or an academic research group.
Instead, you&rsquo;ll be put on a project and expected to work well with whoever else is on it.
Your performance will depend as much on your ability to get along with others
as it will on your raw technical ability,
so you might as well start practicing those skills now.</p>
<p>If instructors create teams,
they should avoid isolating at-risk students.
Women and members of racial minority groups are more likely to drop out of computer science than other students,
particularly in first and second year,
and one of the main reasons is feeling isolated or out of place.
Research has shown that putting at-risk students together in the first couple of years can mitigate this problem
[<a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780262632690">Margolis2002</a>].
t is less necessary in upper years,
since by then students have a stronger commitment to whatever program they&rsquo;re in,
but it still helps to prevent some of the problems discussed in the next section.</p>
<p>The biggest headache when instructors select teams is scheduling.
COVID-19 has made distributed work more normal,
but the University of Toronto has three campuses spread across a large metropolitan area,
which means some students commute an hour and a half each way to get to classes.
Instructors should therefore take students&rsquo; schedules into account when forming teams.
If the class is small,
the simplest way is to get each student to fill in a weekly timesheet showing when they&rsquo;re available
and then group people who have large blocks of overlap.
If the class is larger,
a web-based calendaring tool may be easier.
Instructors can even try to use whatever software the university uses to figure out course timetables,
although that usually doesn&rsquo;t scale down to in-class scheduling.</p>
<p>Another factor to take into account is that some people are naturally early birds while others are night owls.
Putting the two on the same team pretty much guarantees that someone will miss meetings
or sleep through them
no matter when they&rsquo;re held.
Simply asking people, &ldquo;Do you prefer to work in the morning, or the evening?&rdquo;
can be surprisingly effective [<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01752v1">Zavgorodniaia2021</a>].</p>
<p>However people are put together,
each team should have at least one block of two hours to work together each week outside of class.
Teams should also try to find a second block that&rsquo;s half an hour long for a weekly meeting.
Try to keep the two blocks separate
so that it&rsquo;s clear to everyone when they&rsquo;re supposed to be talking about the project
and when they&rsquo;re supposed to be doing design, writing code, testing, and so on.
If the two are scheduled back-to-back,
the meeting will drag on into working time or vice versa.</p>

      Making Decisions
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2025-01-06" class="post-date">2025-01-06</time></p>
  <p>The first release of GitHub&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/github/MVG">Minimum Viable Governance</a> guidelines
included this:</p>
<div class="callout">
<p><strong>2.1. Consensus-Based Decision Making</strong></p>
<p>Projects make decisions through consensus of the Maintainers.
While explicit agreement of all Maintainers is preferred,
it is not required for consensus.
Rather,
the Maintainers will determine consensus based on their good faith consideration of a number of factors,
including the dominant view of the Contributors and nature of support and objections.
The Maintainers will document evidence of consensus in accordance with these requirements.</p>
</div>
<p>It sounds reasonable,
but it&rsquo;s wrong-headed.
Every team has a power structure:
the question is whether it&rsquo;s formal or informalâ€”in other words,
whether it&rsquo;s accountable or unaccountable [<a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/528558">Freeman2013</a>].
In the latter case,
decisions will effectively be made by the people
who are the most self-confident or stubborn
rather than by those with the most insight.</p>
<p>To guard against this,
groups need to spell out who has the authority to make which decisions
and how to achieve consensus.
In short,
they need explicit governance.</p>
<p>Martha&rsquo;s Rules [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/088610998600100206">Minahan1986</a>]
are a practical way to do this in groups of up to a few dozen people,
and work very well for smaller teams too:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Before each meeting, anyone who wishes may sponsor a proposal.
    Proposals must be filed at least 24 hours before a meeting in order to be considered,
    and must include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a one-line summary</li>
<li>the full text of the proposal</li>
<li>any required background information</li>
<li>pros and cons</li>
<li>possible alternatives</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A quorum is established in a meeting if half or more of voting members are present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once a person has sponsored a proposal,
    the group may not discuss or vote on the issue
    unless the sponsor or their delegate is present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the sponsor presents the proposal a <em>sense vote</em> is cast:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thumbs up: who likes the proposal?</li>
<li>Thumbs down: who is uncomfortable with the proposal?</li>
<li>Thumbs sideways: who can live with?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If everyone likes or can live with the proposal,
    it passes with no further discussion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the majority is uncomfortable with the proposal,
    it is sent back to its sponsor for further work.
    (The sponsor may decide to drop it if it&rsquo;s clear the majority isn&rsquo;t ever going to support it.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise,
    the group has a brief moderated discussion.
    After 10 minutes,
    or when no one has anything further to add,
    the moderator calls for a straight yes-or-no vote on the proposal.
    If a majority votes &ldquo;yes&rdquo; it is adopted;
    otherwise,
    it is returned to the sponsor for further work.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Every group that uses Martha&rsquo;s Rules must make two procedural decisions:</p>
<dl>
<dt>How are proposals put forward?</dt>
<dd>The easiest way to do this in a software project
is to file an issue in the project&rsquo;s issue tracker
tagged <code>proposal</code>.
Team members can comment on it there
so that the sponsor can revise it before bringing it to a vote.</dd>
<dt>Who gets to vote?</dt>
<dd>In a course project the answer is &ldquo;whoever is part of the team,&rdquo;
but a more explicit rule is needed for larger or longer-lived projects.
One method is for existing members to nominate new ones,
and for the team to hold a straight yes-or-no vote on each.
Another is to automatically include anyone whose changes to the code
were accepted by existing members,
though this under-values non-programming contributions
like doing code reviews
or testing new releases.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Rules that people don&rsquo;t know about can&rsquo;t help them.
Once your team agrees on a decision-making procedure,
document it for newcomers
(and to prevent disputes among people already in the team).
You can put this in the project&rsquo;s <code>README</code> file
or in a separate file called <code>CONTRIBUTING</code>.
Wherever it goes,
remember that the easier it is for people to figure out how to contribute,
the more likely they are to do so [<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2593702.2593704">Steinmacher2014</a>].</p>
<h2>Nothing about us without us</h2>
<p>The rules laid out above were created
by and for people near the middle of the bell curve with respect to focus and attention span.
People who are neurodivergent
(i.e., whose brains work differently from the average
when it comes to sociability, learning, attention, and mood)
may find that other approaches work better for them.</p>
<p>But while society accepts that
people of different heights need different desks and seating to be comfortable,
there is still a lot of stigma
associated with differences in mental function,
which are often classified according to how inconvenient they are to other people.
One example is how tests for
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are phrased.
&ldquo;Subject is overly talkative&rdquo;: compared to who?
&ldquo;Subject does X when it is inappropriate&rdquo;: by whose rules?
&ldquo;Struggles to pay attention&rdquo;: in fact,
most people with ADHD can pay very close attention,
but not when they are in environments like noisy classrooms
that are full of distractions.</p>
<p>Decisions that affect people should only be made
with the full participation of those who will be affected.
If you are neurodivergent,
you probably have a set of strategies for managing time and attention.
If you are neurotypical and have neurodivergent teammates,
ask them what works well for them rather than ignoring the difference
or guessing what they might want.
Please do the same if you have teammates who have difficulty seeing, hearing, or moving about:
they have expertise you don&rsquo;t.</p>
