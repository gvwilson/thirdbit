    <a href="../2025/03/29/tooling-for-snailz/">
      Tooling for Snailz
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2025-03-29" class="post-date">2025-03-29</time></p>
  <p>I built <a href="https://github.com/gvwilson/snailz">a synthetic data generator</a> last year to use in a &ldquo;software design for data scientists&rdquo; tutorial
that I never finished writing.
Over the last week I rewrote it as a way of exploring some new tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The command-line interface to <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview">Claude</a>.
    I&rsquo;m disgusted by the amorality of the AI industry,
    but am now convinced that the coding tools are here to stay:
    writing tests and refactoring code with Claude&rsquo;s help was <em>much</em> faster than doing it by hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/"><code>uv</code></a> for managing the packages and virtual environment and for running commands.
    It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve used it as itself rather than running <code>uv pip whatever</code>;
    never going back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/"><code>ruff</code></a> and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyright/"><code>pyright</code></a> for checking the code.
    <code>ruff</code> is a joy,
    but checking type annotations with <code>pyright</code> cost me a couple of hours.
    It&rsquo;s not the tool&rsquo;s fault, though:
    figuring out how to annotate the last 5% of the code led to me writing my first <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0544/">protocol</a>
    and then throwing up my hands and replacing it with <code>Any</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/"><code>pydantic</code></a> for storing and validating records,
    including the data that <code>snailz</code> generates and the parameters used in generation.
    I started with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html"><code>dataclasses</code></a>,
    but switched as soon as I found myself<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> adding methods that <code>pydantic</code> already had.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pydoit.org/"><code>doit</code></a> to run commands instead of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Make</a>.
    I&rsquo;m more comfortable with the latter,
    but I recognize that writing Makefiles is a dying art.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/"><code>mkdocs</code></a> for documentation instead of <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/">Sphinx</a> or <a href="https://pdoc.dev/"><code>pdoc</code></a><sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.
    I find <code>mkdocs</code> easier to work with than Sphinx,
    and <code>pdoc</code> doesn&rsquo;t support &ldquo;extra&rdquo; Markdown pages as well as <code>mkdocs</code>.
    (If the folks at <a href="https://astral.sh/">Astral</a> are looking for new product ideas,
    a better documentation generator would have at least one paying customer the day it launched…)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://docs.pytest.org/"><code>pytest</code></a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyfakefs/"><code>pyfakefs</code></a>, and <a href="https://faker.readthedocs.io/"><code>faker</code></a> for testing
    and <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/"><code>click</code></a> for building the command-line interface instead of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html"><code>argparse</code></a>.</p>

  <p>I wish we didn&rsquo;t have to talk about this,
but given the Trump administration&rsquo;s brutal assault on science
and its equally brutal bullying of scientists,
we need to start making plans.
What happens if they come for you, your research, and your data?
What happens if Nadella doesn&rsquo;t kiss ass hard enough or fast enough
and Musk gets a judge to restrict access to GitHub?
(It wouldn&rsquo;t be hard:
find a repository with some DEI-related content or copyrighted material and say,
&ldquo;Turn it off until everything can be reviewed.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>I wish there were more training programs like <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/learning-reflections/keeping-those-on-the-front-lines-of-change-safe-five-years-of-the-ford-foundation-grantee-safety-program/">this one</a>.
Until there are,
here are my thoughts on what you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accept that the threat is both real and random.<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s a continuum of risk, but everyone scientist in the US is now a potential target.<ul>
<li>As with censorship, the turmoil is the point: hurt a few to frighten the rest into acquiescence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And the damage might spread:
    Canada&rsquo;s previous Conservative prime minister <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/second-opinion-scientists-muzzled-1.4588913">muzzled scientists</a>,
    and the current Conservative leader will undoubtedly go further if he wins the upcoming election.</li>
<li>Remember, nobody at the Climate Research Unit thought they might be a target until <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatic_Research_Unit_email_controversy">Climategate</a> happened.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Threat models (taken from <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008563">this paper</a> with modifications):<ul>
<li>Casual threat (&ldquo;drive by&rdquo;): opportunistic but not determined (but see &ldquo;institutional threat&rdquo; below).</li>
<li>Intimate threat: a life partner (not a big one for this conversation).</li>
<li>Insider threat: &ldquo;inside the fortress&rdquo; (i.e., the departmental sys admin is a DOGE appointee or MAGA sympathizer).</li>
<li>Institutional threat: the rules change and now you&rsquo;re a target: this was loony tunes two months ago and is now our reality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Recognize that getting people to adopt secure habits is as hard as getting people to practice safe sex was in the 1980s.<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Security theatre&rdquo; on the part of institutions is a big part of the problem.</li>
<li>&ldquo;We will send your performance review as a Word document&rdquo; practically trains people to be unsafe.</li>
<li>Programmers have made security needlessly painful.<ul>
<li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1251421.1251435">&ldquo;Why Johnny Can&rsquo;t Encrypt&rdquo;</a> was published a quarter of a century ago and nothing has gotten easier.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Immediate actions (in order):<ol>
<li>Don&rsquo;t open that attachment, install that software, or click on that link without checking.<ul>
<li>Or talk to the &ldquo;journalist&rdquo; who just cold-called you without verifying their credentials.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Put open licenses on everything you can, make sure colleagues have copies, and <a href="https://sciop.net/datasets/">copy their data and code</a> return.<ul>
<li>This isn&rsquo;t just about human threats: talk to anyone who lost work because of Hurricane Katrina.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use a password manager (I recommend <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>),
    two-factor authentication,
    and <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> (it&rsquo;s the only trustworthy messaging app out there).</li>
<li>Identify services you could migrate to,
    e.g., <a href="https://www.sync.com/">Sync</a> (hosted in Canada) and <a href="https://whereby.com/">Whereby</a> (in Norway) instead of Dropbox and Zoom (US).</li>
<li>Ask (require) IT to make &ldquo;what if&rdquo; plans <em>and test them out</em>.<ul>
<li>E.g., make nightly backups of your GitHub issues (which aren&rsquo;t stored in the Git repositories),
your Slack conversations,
and everything in your Google Drive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lobby your professional association to put policies and plans in place <em>and enforce them</em>.<ul>
<li>The Royal Society&rsquo;s decision not to expel Musk was as shortsighted as it was cowardly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And now a request:
if you are taking steps like these right now,
I would be very grateful if you could <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">share your experience</a>
(or better yet, a checklist of what you&rsquo;ve done that other people could do).
I&rsquo;m not looking for &ldquo;we could X&rdquo;, &ldquo;you should Y&rdquo;, or &ldquo;maybe it&rsquo;s time to think about Z&rdquo;,
but rather a list of what you&rsquo;ve done and what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>

  <p><time datetime="2025-03-08" class="post-date">2025-03-08</time></p>
  <p>Suppose you are building a static site generator that turns a bunch of Markdown files into HTML pages.
The Markdown files include links to external sites;
to ensure these are consistent between pages,
you have decided to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>All links to external sites are written as <code>[text][some_key]</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The keys and their associated URLs are stored in a YAML file like this:
    <div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>- key: first
  url: https://first.site
- key: second
  url: https://second.site
</code></pre></div></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The static site generator reads the YAML file and converts the content to a block of text
    like the one shown below,
    then appends that text to each Markdown file in memory before translating to HTML:
    <div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>[first]: https://first.site
[second]: https://second.site
</code></pre></div></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now comes the hard part.
Your static site generator includes a linting tool that checks for common mistakes,
such as improperly-nested headings or undefined bibliography references.
You want to check that every link reference corresponds to an entry in the YAML file
and that everyone entry in the YAML file is used at least once.
Your first attempt uses a regular expression to find patterns of the form <code>[some][url]</code> in the Markdown,
then does the obvious two-sided check with the URLs.
However,
your Markdown files also include snippets of Python code;
these may contain chained subscripts like <code>grid[x][y]</code>,
which cause your linter to produce spurious error reports.
What should you do?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Implement some sort of &ldquo;known problem&rdquo; list to suppress the spurious error messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use regular expressions to erase code chunks from your Markdown files before searching for link references.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait until the Markdown has been converted to HTML,
    then walk the DOM tree and check all the text that isn&rsquo;t in code chunks.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution #1 requires users to do extra work (and re-work as their content changes),
so let&rsquo;s set it aside.
It&rsquo;s easier to implement a first version of Solution #2 than of Solution #3,
but Solution #2 turns out to be surprisingly tricky to get right:
Markdown allows for indented code blocks,
and inline code sections might be marked with <code>&lt;code&gt;…&lt;/code&gt;</code> rather than with single backticks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are other solutions,
some of which may be better than the ones I&rsquo;ve outlined,
but the point of this post is that when I say &ldquo;software design&rdquo;,
what I mean is &ldquo;answers to questions like these and the justifications behind them&rdquo;.
I wish there were more worked examples that discussed the pros and cons of possible solutions—I feel like
I still have a lot to learn.</p>

  <p>There&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; to know.
You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say.
Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong,
if you aren&rsquo;t positive yourself.
Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words…although
I&rsquo;ve seen scripts where I know words weren&rsquo;t spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all.
So I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s too important.
Anyway, you come to the last page you write in &lsquo;Fade out&rsquo;

      Human Connection
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2025-01-26" class="post-date">2025-01-26</time></p>
  <p>I was an enthusiastic proponent of MOOCs (self-paced online video courses) when they first appeared.
Like many people,
I believed that recording the best teachers in the world
and putting those recordings online with auto-graded exercises
would democratize education on a global scale.
I eventually realized that I was guilty of a category error:
the real divide in teaching and learning isn&rsquo;t in-person versus online,
but interactive versus directive.
If you and I are riffing off each other&rsquo;s ideas in real time,
it doesn&rsquo;t matter (much) if we&rsquo;re sitting side by side or on a video call:
we have a human connection that isn&rsquo;t present if you record a video for me to watch
or write a book for me to read.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this as I&rsquo;ve been doing reviews on <a href="https://www.scribophile.com/">Scribophile</a>,
teaching myself <a href="https://gleam.run/">Gleam</a> on <a href="https://exercism.org/">Exercism</a>,
supervising some <a href="../projects/">undergraduate students</a> at the University of Toronto,
and trying to figure out how I feel about AI coding tools:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Doing reviews&rdquo; means commenting other people&rsquo;s work as well as posting my own fiction,
    because doing the former is the only way to earn the points needed to do the latter.
    It&rsquo;s a simple, transparent, and remarkably effective mechanism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m not actually &ldquo;teaching myself&rdquo; on Exercism.
    Instead,
    I&rsquo;m being taught indirectly by the people who have contributed exercises for me to do
    and by those other learners who have posted their solutions for me to compare mine against.
    I don&rsquo;t have to post mine or take part in communal code reviews in the way that I do on Scribophile,
    but I learn a lot faster (and enjoy learning more) if I do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the students I&rsquo;m working with use AI tools
    as frequently and un-self-consciously as the students I had 15 years ago used Stack Overflow.
    One of them said it&rsquo;s like pair programming with someone who knows a lot but thinks he knows everything;
    another student I spoke to at <a href="https://2025.cusec.net/">CUSEC</a> a couple of weeks ago said that
    she mostly uses AI for &ldquo;why not?&rdquo; questions,
    as in,
    &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t this piece of code work?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m really intrigued by <a href="https://getunblocked.com/">Unblocked</a>,
    which uses LLM technology to answer questions about legacy code bases.
    Why do we have to test these three conditions in this precise order?
    Why do we have to repeat this configuration value in two places?
    Unblocked can answer these questions as well as
    someone who worked on the code two years ago and hasn&rsquo;t touched it since,
    but only if it&rsquo;s fed the whole conversation:
    code review comments, chat, docs, and everything else.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What ties all these together in my mind (this morning at least) is that &ldquo;interactive vs. directive&rdquo; continuum.
Are LLMs just (or &ldquo;just&rdquo;) a way to interact with other people indirectly?
When I ask an LLM a question,
its answer is a statistical amalgam of answers that people I&rsquo;ve never met might have given;
should I put that in the same mental bucket as viewing other people&rsquo;s exericse solutions on Exercism,
reading other people&rsquo;s answers to questions on Stack Overflow,
or looking through old chat logs and code review comments?
It certainly feels more like that to me than watching a video or reading a blog post like this one.</p>
<p>I realize that LLMs only provide the illusion of a human connection,
but does that have to be the case?
Can an LLM be an extra voice when <a href="https://youtu.be/2LbuoxAy56o">a group of students debate each other</a>
rather than a substitute for person-to-person interaction?
Can the AI in my IDE tell me who on the team I should talk to
rather than trying to be spicy auto-complete?
I think that investigating those questions will help us avoid making
the same kind of category error I made all those years ago.</p>

  <p>Everyone knows the story:
Lucy keeps telling Charlie Brown he can kick the football and then pulls it away at the last moment,
while Charlie Brown keeps trying because he&rsquo;s just not very smart.
But there are two other versions of the story.
In one,
Charlie Brown knows Lucy will pull the ball away
but keeps trying to kick it
because he has internalized everything people have said about him
and believes repeated disappointment is all he deserves.
In the other,
he&rsquo;s waiting for Lucy to grow bored and ask,
&ldquo;Why do you keep trying?&rdquo;
so that he can say,
&ldquo;Because I love you and am here to help you get past this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the outside, it&rsquo;s hard to tell these stories apart.</p>
