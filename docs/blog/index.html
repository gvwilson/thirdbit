<p>When I was a PhD student, I attended a talk by the late Robin Milner where he said two things that have stuck with me.
The first, I repeat quite often.
He argued that credit for an invention did not belong to the first person to invent something
but to the first person to explain it well enough that no one needed to invent it again.
His first historical example was Leibniz publishing calculus and then Newton claiming he invented it first:
it didn&rsquo;t matter if he did or not,
he failed to explain it to anyone and so the fact that Leibniz needed to independently invent it was Newton&rsquo;s failure.</p>

  <p><em>I&rsquo;m going to ask a favor, but I need to tell a story first.</em></p>
<p>Back in 2017,
in the wake of Trump&rsquo;s first inauguration and the Muslim travel ban,
I tried to get a bunch of people to write a chapter each for
<a href="../ideas/sdgc/">a book</a> that would explain basic ideas in politics, economics, and justice to programmers.
The model had succeeded before:
<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/beautiful-code/9780596510046/"><em>Beautiful Code</em></a>,
<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/making-software/9780596808310/"><em>Making Software</em></a>,
and <a href="https://aosabook.org/"><em>The Architecture of Open Source Applications</em></a>
were all widely read,
so I thought something that covered regulatory capture,
how it is that &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; became &ldquo;property&rdquo;,
why people routinely vote against their own interests,
and so on would find an audience.</p>
<p>The project never really got off the ground.
The programmers who volunteered to help didn&rsquo;t really know the subjects themselves
(though a couple of them tried valiantly to learn as much as they could in a hurry).
As for the social scientists I approached,
they were either too busy with their own projects,
(quite reasonably) wanted to be paid,
or simply didn&rsquo;t know how to talk to people in tech
with essentially no background in the humanities.
Their idea of &ldquo;basic&rdquo; was what they would teach in freshman college course;
unfortunately,
most programmers are at a tenth-grade level
when it comes to understanding how society works.
In fact it&rsquo;s worse than that:
most programmers (including me) know as little about politics and economics
as the average political science major knows about recursion,
but we <em>think</em> we know a lot more.</p>
<p>So here we are eight years later.
I think it&rsquo;s more important than ever
to offer an accessible, compelling alternative
to the self-serving libertarian brogrammer bullshit that is
Silicon Valley&rsquo;s default setting,
but before I break my &ldquo;no new projects&rdquo; rule and try to get something off the ground,
I&rsquo;d like to ask the favor I mentioned at the start of this post.
If you were part of something post-2016 that actually had an impact in tech,
I&rsquo;d be very grateful if you could <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">let me know</a>
what you did,
what it changed,
and how you know.
The Ford Foundation&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/learning-reflections/keeping-those-on-the-front-lines-of-change-safe-five-years-of-the-ford-foundation-grantee-safety-program/">Grantee Safety Program</a> is a great example:
thank you in advance for pointers to others.</p>

      Stained Glass

  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2024-11-07" class="post-date">2024-11-07</time></p>
  <p>Many years ago,
a slightly inebriated graduate student told me that
stained glass windows have their roots in Gnosticism.
According to her,
some Gnostics believed that creating the universe was so great an effort
that it shattered God into pieces.
Each of us has one of those piecesâ€”we call it a soulâ€”and
our purpose in this world is to reassemble them to re-create the divine.
That&rsquo;s what stained glass portrays:
fragments of something greater brought together to be made whole.
But no piece is completed by just one other;
instead,
each piece is only where it belongs when it&rsquo;s joined with several others.</p>
<p>Time to make another cup of tea.
If you came in peace, be welcome.</p>

  <p>My desktop background says &ldquo;no new projects&rdquo;
but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I can&rsquo;t dream.
It has been twelve years since we published the first two volumnes of
<a href="https://aosabook.org/"><em>The Architecture of Open Source Applications</em></a>:
if someone was going to put together a sequel with chapter-length descriptions of
the architectures of open source projects that have risen to prominence since then,
what would you want it to include?
Candidates so far include:</p>

<li><a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Two things stand out for me:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There&rsquo;s a definite bias toward Python in this list,
    and a lamentable lack of distributed/fault-tolerant projects.
    Both are reflections of my biases and the biases of my circle of online acquaintances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think this would be a great collection,
    but I&rsquo;m just as interested in a book on
    the architecture of open source <em>organizations</em>.
    People talk about &ldquo;the&rdquo; open source community,
    but in practice we are hundreds or thousands of intersecting collections of people
    who have evolved many different ways to organize ourselves.
    I would love to read a collection of case studies of those different models,
    including commercial models.
    (Full disclore:
    my <a href="https://plotly.com/">current employer</a> is an open-core company,
    but our particular model is just one of many.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever put either book together,
but if you&rsquo;re interested,
I&rsquo;d be happy to offer advice.</p>

      A Wish List

  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2024-10-20" class="post-date">2024-10-20</time></p>
  <p>Earlier this year I wrote <a href="../2024/02/25/my-last-to-dont-list/">my last to-don&rsquo;t list</a>.
As the leaves turn and the days get shorter,
here&rsquo;s a list of things I hope I <em>will</em> get to do.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dive the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Blue_Hole">Great Blue Hole</a> in Belize with my wife.
    We both love diving,
    but we&rsquo;ve never done it together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visit <a href="https://bcparks.ca/cape-scott-park/">Cape Scott National Park</a> with my family.
    I grew up on Vancouver Island but have never been further north than Alert Bay;
    we were planning to go a couple of years ago
    but spent the week in bed with COVID instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revisit Japan, also with my family.
    I had a week in Kyoto back in 1993,
    but I spent most of it in a basement,
    and I&rsquo;ve always regretted that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spend a year or two programming with and for young scientists.
    It would be nice if something from this turned into an open source package
    that other people picked up,
    but that would be a bonus;
    what I want most is just to feel useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Publish some books for young readers.
    I&rsquo;ve been working on several for years;
    I&rsquo;ll be disappointed if I&rsquo;m remaindered before any of them are on the shelf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Play Semisonic&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGytDsqkQY8"><em>Closing Time</em></a> on stage in a band,
    mostly for the practice sessions beforehandâ€”I miss jamming with friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eat a meal at a fancy restaurant that was prepared by my daughter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Celebrate my fortieth wedding anniversary.
    I&rsquo;d like to see my fiftieth,
    but I&rsquo;m trying to be realisticâ€¦</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bring my wife tea in the morning every day until that anniversary
    and for many years afterward.
    (I&rsquo;d like to bring tea to my daughter every day as well,
    but I expect she&rsquo;ll want to move out at some point.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave this world believing that it&rsquo;s going to be OK.</p>
</li>

  <h2 class="post-title">
    <a href="../2024/10/18/student-project-proposals/">
      Student Project Proposals
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2024-10-18" class="post-date">2024-10-18</time></p>
  <p>My laptop screensaver says &ldquo;no new projects&rdquo; but I&rsquo;d make an exception
to supervise a team of 2-4 undergraduates who wanted to tackle one of
the challenges described below. If you are teaching an undergraduate
capstone course and might be interested, please reach out.</p>
<h2>Browsercast</h2>
<p>Tools like PowerPoint aren&rsquo;t web-friendly.  When you export a
slideshow to present on the web, what you actually get is a bunch of
images.  There&rsquo;s no text, just pixels arranged in the shapes of
letters; no hyperlinks; and nothing search engines or disability aids
can read.  What&rsquo;s worse, if you want something people can replay, you
have to make a screencast, which are just as opaque to search engines
and disability aids and probably several times larger than the
original slides.</p>
<p>Browsercast is our solution to this problem.  It plays snippets of
audio in your browser as you move through your slides.  &ldquo;View Source&rdquo;,
links, CSS, screen readers, and search work as they should because
it&rsquo;s all still web-native HTML.  And since it&rsquo;s just text and audio,
it&rsquo;s a fraction of the size of a video, which makes it ideal for
mobile devices.</p>
<p>Our prototype uses just 5kb of JavaScript and is available under the
MIT License. There are many open questions; we are looking for a team
of 2-4 students with strong JavaScript skills and an interest in user
experience design to explore ways we can make it better.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2>Marimo and H5P</h2>
<p>Marimo is a next-generation computational notebook that enables data
scientists to mix code, discussion, and results in a reproducible way.
Its plugin system relies on AnyWidget, which specifies a simple
contract between extensions and Marimo&rsquo;s rendering and execution
engine.</p>
<p>The aim of this project is to design, build, and test a set of Marimo
plugins that can be used for classroom exercises similar to those in
the H5P toolkit: multiple choice, fill in the blanks, and so on. We
are looking for a team of 2-4 students with both JavaScript and Python
skills who have an interest in both user experience design and
teaching.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://marimo.io/">Marimo Notebook</a></li>
<li><a href="https://anywidget.dev/">AnyWidget</a></li>
<li><a href="https://h5p.org/content-types-and-applications">H5P Content Types</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Dragnet</h2>
<p>One type of exercise that H5P <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> support is adding labels to
diagrams. <a href="https://iezer.github.io/dragnet/">This prototype</a> takes an SVG with some
specially-marked labels, moves those labels to the side, and then lets
the user try to drag them back into the right places.  A deployable
version would need to do a lot more, such as dealing with scaling
transformations; the goal of this project is to turn the demo into
something a classroom teacher could use.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://iezer.github.io/dragnet/">Dragnet</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>A Tutorial Simulation of Network Protocols</h2>
<p><a href="https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/"><em>Software Design by Example in Python</em></a> deliberately ignored
concurrency, partial failure, and everything else associated with
modern distributed applications. The aim of this project is to (start
to) fix that by building scale models of real network protocols such
as TCP and the BitTorrent protocol using either <a href="https://pydes.readthedocs.io/">Py-DES</a> or
<a href="https://simpy.readthedocs.io/">SimPy</a>. The tutorials will use simulators so that the
accompanying lessons could illustrate edge cases in reproducible ways;
making the implementations work on a real network as well will be a
good stretch goal.</p>
<h2>Software Design by Example in Gleam</h2>
<p>For decades, functional programming (FP) has offered an alternative to
the imperative, procedural model used by most languages. As highly
concurrent systems have become the norm, FP&rsquo;s promise of preventing
entire classes of bugs by avoiding mutable state has led a growing
number of programmers to re-examine it, but there is still often a
gulf between the kinds of examples language designers find
interesting and the kinds of things most working programmers build.</p>
<p><a href="https://gleam.run/">Gleam</a> is a modern functional language that runs on the
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/">Erlang/OTP</a> platform (and can also be compiled to
JavaScript). The aim of this project is to translate examples from
<a href="https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/"><em>Software Design by Example in Python</em></a> into Gleam to help
people coming from Python and other mainstream languages understand
how to use FP in practice.</p>
