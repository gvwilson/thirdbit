    <a href="../2024/12/01/more-student-project-proposals/">
      More Student Project Proposals
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2024-12-01" class="post-date">2024-12-01</time></p>
  <p>Six weeks ago I posted some <a href="../2024/10/18/student-project-proposals/">undergraduate software projects</a>
that I would be excited about supervising.  Two of those—Browsercast
and the Marimo plugins—have been picked up by students at the
University of Toronto.  The other three are still available, and I&rsquo;ve
added a couple of others (see below). If you&rsquo;re a senior looking for
a capstone project or a professor looking for projects with a
supervisor, please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">get in touch</a>.</p>
<h2>Dragnet</h2>
<p>One type of exercise that H5P <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> support is adding labels to
diagrams. <a href="https://iezer.github.io/dragnet/">This prototype</a> takes an SVG with some
specially-marked labels, moves those labels to the side, and then lets
the user try to drag them back into the right places.  A deployable
version would need to do a lot more, such as dealing with scaling
transformations; the goal of this project is to turn the demo into
something a classroom teacher could use.</p>
<h2>Tutorial Simulations of Distributed Systems</h2>
<p><a href="https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/"><em>Software Design by Example in Python</em></a> deliberately ignored
concurrency, partial failure, and everything else associated with
modern distributed applications. The aim of this project is to (start
to) fix that by building scale models of distributed protocols and
systems from TCP to BitTorrent and load-balancing tools using either
<a href="https://pydes.readthedocs.io/">Py-DES</a> or <a href="https://simpy.readthedocs.io/">SimPy</a>. The tutorials will use simulators
so that the accompanying lessons could illustrate edge cases in
reproducible ways.</p>
<h2>Software Design by Example in Gleam</h2>
<p><a href="https://gleam.run/">Gleam</a> is a modern functional language that runs on the
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/">Erlang/OTP</a> platform (and can also be compiled to
JavaScript). The aim of this project is to translate examples from
<a href="https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/"><em>Software Design by Example in Python</em></a> into Gleam to help
people coming from Python and other mainstream languages understand
how to use FP in practice.</p>
<h2>Parallelizing Marimo Notebooks</h2>
<p><a href="https://marimo.io/">Marimo</a> is a next-generation computational notebook that (a)
stores everything as Python source code and (b) analyzes code to
prevent out-of-order execution of cells. <a href="https://dagster.io/">Dagster</a> and
<a href="https://metaflow.org/">Metaflow</a> are computational workflow tools that allow users
to add decorators to functions and methods to specify computational
chunks. The goal of this project is to see if the two can be married,
i.e., to see if it&rsquo;s possible to add decorators to cell functions in
Marimo to parallelize notebooks directly.</p>
<h2>Extending Lox</h2>
<p>Lox is a simple interpreted language created by Robert Nystrom for his
(excellent) book <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/"><em>Crafting Interpreters</em></a>. Many people have
extended it in various ways; in this project, students would re-create
Lox by working through the second half of Nystrom&rsquo;s book, then add
operator overloading, cooperative concurrency, and a few other features
to bring the language up to par with <a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>.</p>
<h2>Automatic Identification of Variable Roles</h2>
<p>Sajaniemi et al&rsquo;s work on <a href="https://www.ppig.org/files/2005-PPIG-17th-sajaniemi.pdf">roles of variables</a> identified and
named ten small patterns in the way variables are used in novice
programs. This project would build static and dynamic analysis tools
to detect those patterns (and possibly others) in programs as an aid
to teaching, debugging, and code review.</p>
<h2>Entity-Relationship Diagrams for Dataframes</h2>
<p>Entity-relation (ER) diagrams are one of the few graphical notations
that programmers actually use voluntarily.  This project would use
static and dynamic analysis to extract ER diagrams from programs that
use dataframe libraries like <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> and <a href="https://pola.rs/">Polars</a> to
show how dataframes are being combined, e.g., to infer foreign key
relationships.</p>
<h2>The Impact of Calibrated Peer Review</h2>
<p>Give a novice programmer a one-page program and have them score it
using a checklist, then grade them on how closely their scoring
matches the instructor’s. (They start with 100%, and lose one mark for
each false positive or false negative.) After doing this a handful of
times, they should learn to see code through the instructor’s
eyes. Does this help them write better code? If so, how quickly and
how well?</p>

    <a href="../2024/11/30/another-ssg-for-lessons/">
      Another Static Site Generator for Lessons
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2024-11-30" class="post-date">2024-11-30</time></p>
  <p>I built a very simple static site generator (SSG) called <a href="https://github.com/lessonomicon/mccole">McCole</a>
to support the lessons I mentioned in <a href="../2024/11/24/unfinished-projects/">my previous post</a>.
I could have stuck with <a href="https://www.dmulholl.com/docs/ark/main/">Ark</a>
(which I use to build this site and books like <a href="../sdxpy/"><em>Software Design in Python</em></a>),
but writing my own helped me figure out what I actually need,
and might someday serve as the basis for a tutorial of some sort.
In no particular order, <a href="https://github.com/lessonomicon/mccole">McCole</a>&rsquo;s features are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read configuration from the project&rsquo;s <code>pyproject.toml</code> file.</li>
<li>Convert all the Markdown files in or below the project&rsquo;s root directory to HTML
    using <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/">Jinja</a> templates.</li>
<li>Rename a few files along the way:<ul>
<li><code>README.md</code> becomes <code>index.html</code></li>
<li><code>CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</code> becomes <code>code_of_conduct.html</code></li>
<li><code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> becomes <code>contributing.html</code></li>
<li><code>LICENSE.md</code> becomes <code>license.html</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create an HTML page corresponding to every source code file
    so that (for example) <code>a/b.py</code> is visible online as <code>a/b.py.html</code>.</li>
<li>Replace <code>@root</code> at the start of URLs with the relative path to the site&rsquo;s root directory.</li>
<li>Replace links to Markdown files with links to the corresponding HTML files.
    I do this so that links would work properly when people view the Markdown files on GitHub.</li>
<li>Rewrite the URL in something like <code>[label](b:key)</code> to <code>[label](@root/bibliography.html#key)</code>
    to make it easy for authors to link to bibliographic citations.
    These special links <em>don&rsquo;t</em> work when files are viewed on GitHub,
    but it&rsquo;s a lot less typing that the alternative.
    (I use the <a href="https://github.com/dmulholl/shortcodes">shortcodes</a> package to do this with <a href="https://www.dmulholl.com/docs/ark/main/">Ark</a> sites,
    but after a bit of experimentation I decided to special-case these links in <a href="https://github.com/lessonomicon/mccole">McCole</a>.)</li>
<li>Similarly,
    <a href="https://github.com/lessonomicon/mccole">McCole</a> rewrites <code>[term](g:key)</code> to <code>[term](@root/glossary.html#key)</code>
    so that authors can easily insert glossary references.</li>
<li>If a page contains any glossary references,
    <a href="https://github.com/lessonomicon/mccole">McCole</a> creates a list of defined terms at the top of the page.
    (In my experience,
    this is the most useful way to tell a would-be instructor what the lesson is actually about.)</li>
<li>I tried using shortcodes to format figures consistently,
    but once I decided not to use them for the glossary and bibliography,
    it didn&rsquo;t seem worth keeping them for figures.
    Instead,
    I check their properties during linting (see below).</li>
<li>My tutorials focus on programming,
    so I need to be able to include snippets of source code in pages.
    &ldquo;Snippets&rdquo; makes the problem more complex:
    I often want to include just one function or a couple of methods rather than an entire source file.
    My previous SSG had a couple of hundred lines of code
    to pull sections out of source files in various ways;
    <a href="https://github.com/lessonomicon/mccole">McCole</a> just checks that the text in the Markdown file
    is contained in the source file.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lessonomicon/mccole">McCole</a> defines a class for each inclusion like <code>language-py</code> or <code>language-sql</code>
    so that inclusions from different languages can be styled differently.
    I haven&rsquo;t included syntax highlighting,
    partly because I want to keep this SSG simple
    but also because the highlighting rules I choose probably <em>won&rsquo;t</em> match what learners see
    in their editor or IDE.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lessonomicon/mccole">McCole</a> includes a tool for linting sites,
    i.e.,
    for checking that links resolve,
    glossary entries are mentioned somewhere,
    and so on.
    It turned out to be a lot simpler to check for problems
    than to generate correct content automatically,
    at least for small lessons.
    <a href="https://github.com/lessonomicon/mccole">McCole</a> also uses <a href="https://pypi.org/project/html5validator/">html5validator</a>
    to check the formatting of the HTML pages it generates;
    specific lessons use tools like <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/">ruff</a> to check source code as well.</li>
</ol>
<p>So what <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> <a href="https://github.com/lessonomicon/mccole">McCole</a> include that a full-featured lesson SSG would?
The most important thing is probably some sort of support for exercises:
styling them,
numbering them,
keeping track of solutions,
and so on.
I could also add CSS styling for various kinds of callouts,
but I&rsquo;m not trying to reproduce something like <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/">the Carpentries Workbench</a>:
<a href="https://github.com/lessonomicon/mccole">McCole</a> is a multi-bit screwdriver,
not a fully-equipped machine shop.</p>

<p>When I was a PhD student, I attended a talk by the late Robin Milner where he said two things that have stuck with me.
The first, I repeat quite often.
He argued that credit for an invention did not belong to the first person to invent something
but to the first person to explain it well enough that no one needed to invent it again.
His first historical example was Leibniz publishing calculus and then Newton claiming he invented it first:
it didn&rsquo;t matter if he did or not,
he failed to explain it to anyone and so the fact that Leibniz needed to independently invent it was Newton&rsquo;s failure.</p>

  <p><em>I&rsquo;m going to ask a favor, but I need to tell a story first.</em></p>
<p>Back in 2017,
in the wake of Trump&rsquo;s first inauguration and the Muslim travel ban,
I tried to get a bunch of people to write a chapter each for
<a href="../ideas/sdgc/">a book</a> that would explain basic ideas in politics, economics, and justice to programmers.
The model had succeeded before:
<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/beautiful-code/9780596510046/"><em>Beautiful Code</em></a>,
<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/making-software/9780596808310/"><em>Making Software</em></a>,
and <a href="https://aosabook.org/"><em>The Architecture of Open Source Applications</em></a>
were all widely read,
so I thought something that covered regulatory capture,
how it is that &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; became &ldquo;property&rdquo;,
why people routinely vote against their own interests,
and so on would find an audience.</p>
<p>The project never really got off the ground.
The programmers who volunteered to help didn&rsquo;t really know the subjects themselves
(though a couple of them tried valiantly to learn as much as they could in a hurry).
As for the social scientists I approached,
they were either too busy with their own projects,
(quite reasonably) wanted to be paid,
or simply didn&rsquo;t know how to talk to people in tech
with essentially no background in the humanities.
Their idea of &ldquo;basic&rdquo; was what they would teach in freshman college course;
unfortunately,
most programmers are at a tenth-grade level
when it comes to understanding how society works.
In fact it&rsquo;s worse than that:
most programmers (including me) know as little about politics and economics
as the average political science major knows about recursion,
but we <em>think</em> we know a lot more.</p>
<p>So here we are eight years later.
I think it&rsquo;s more important than ever
to offer an accessible, compelling alternative
to the self-serving libertarian brogrammer bullshit that is
Silicon Valley&rsquo;s default setting,
but before I break my &ldquo;no new projects&rdquo; rule and try to get something off the ground,
I&rsquo;d like to ask the favor I mentioned at the start of this post.
If you were part of something post-2016 that actually had an impact in tech,
I&rsquo;d be very grateful if you could <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">let me know</a>
what you did,
what it changed,
and how you know.
The Ford Foundation&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/learning-reflections/keeping-those-on-the-front-lines-of-change-safe-five-years-of-the-ford-foundation-grantee-safety-program/">Grantee Safety Program</a> is a great example:

  <p>Many years ago,
a slightly inebriated graduate student told me that
stained glass windows have their roots in Gnosticism.
According to her,
some Gnostics believed that creating the universe was so great an effort
that it shattered God into pieces.
Each of us has one of those pieces—we call it a soul—and
our purpose in this world is to reassemble them to re-create the divine.
That&rsquo;s what stained glass portrays:
fragments of something greater brought together to be made whole.
But no piece is completed by just one other;
instead,
each piece is only where it belongs when it&rsquo;s joined with several others.</p>
<p>Time to make another cup of tea.

<p>Two things stand out for me:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There&rsquo;s a definite bias toward Python in this list,
    and a lamentable lack of distributed/fault-tolerant projects.
    Both are reflections of my biases and those of my acquaintances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think this would be a great collection,
    but I&rsquo;m just as interested in a book on
    the architecture of open source <em>organizations</em>.
    People talk about &ldquo;the&rdquo; open source community,
    but in practice we are hundreds or thousands of intersecting collections of people
    who have evolved many different ways to organize ourselves.
    I would love to read a collection of case studies of those different models,
    including commercial ones.
    (Full disclore:
    my <a href="https://plotly.com/">current employer</a> is an open-core company.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever put either book together,
but as with the original volumes,
I think that assembling this would be a <em>great</em> project
for a graduate class in software architecture.
