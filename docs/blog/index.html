      A Wish List
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2024-10-20" class="post-date">2024-10-20</time></p>
  <p>Earlier this year I wrote <a href="../2024/02/25/my-last-to-dont-list/">my last to-don&rsquo;t list</a>.
As the leaves turn and the days get shorter,
here&rsquo;s a list of things I hope I <em>will</em> get to do.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dive the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Blue_Hole">Great Blue Hole</a> in Belize with my wife.
    We both love diving,
    but we&rsquo;ve never done it together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visit <a href="https://bcparks.ca/cape-scott-park/">Cape Scott National Park</a> with my family.
    I grew up on Vancouver Island but have never been further north than Alert Bay;
    we were planning to go a couple of years ago
    but spent the week in bed with COVID instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revisit Japan, also with my family.
    I had a week in Kyoto back in 1993,
    but I spent most of it in a basement,
    and I&rsquo;ve always regretted that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help create and deliver a workshop on
    <a href="../ideas/leadership/">leadership skills for open science</a>.
    We&rsquo;ve tried hard work and sacrifice for twenty-five years;
    it&rsquo;s time to be more deliberate,
    and I would enjoy being part of this community one more time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spend a year or two programming with and for young scientists.
    It would be nice if something from this turned into an open source package
    that other people picked up,
    but that would be a bonus;
    what I want most is just to feel useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Publish some books for young readers.
    I&rsquo;ve been working on several for years;
    I&rsquo;ll be disappointed if I&rsquo;m remaindered before any of them are on the shelf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Play Semisonic&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGytDsqkQY8"><em>Closing Time</em></a> on stage in a band,
    mostly for the practice sessions beforehand—I miss jamming with friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work on a winning election campaign.
    (I&rsquo;ve never worked for a candidate who won.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eat a meal at a fancy restaurant that was prepared by my daughter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Celebrate my fortieth wedding anniversary.
    I&rsquo;d like to see my fiftieth,
    but I&rsquo;m trying to be realistic…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bring my wife tea in the morning every day until that anniversary
    and for many years afterward.
    (I&rsquo;d like to bring tea to my daughter every day as well,
    but I expect she&rsquo;ll want to move out at some point.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave this world believing that it&rsquo;s going to be OK.</p>
</li>
</ul>

  <h2 class="post-title">
    <a href="../2024/10/18/student-project-proposals/">
      Student Project Proposals
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2024-10-18" class="post-date">2024-10-18</time></p>
  <p>My laptop screensaver says &ldquo;no new projects&rdquo; but I&rsquo;d make an exception
to supervise a team of 2-4 undergraduates who wanted to tackle one of
the challenges described below. If you are teaching an undergraduate
capstone course and might be interested, please reach out.</p>
<h2>Browsercast</h2>
<p>Tools like PowerPoint aren&rsquo;t web-friendly.  When you export a
slideshow to present on the web, what you actually get is a bunch of
images.  There&rsquo;s no text, just pixels arranged in the shapes of
letters; no hyperlinks; and nothing search engines or disability aids
can read.  What&rsquo;s worse, if you want something people can replay, you
have to make a screencast, which are just as opaque to search engines
and disability aids and probably several times larger than the
original slides.</p>
<p>Browsercast is our solution to this problem.  It plays snippets of
audio in your browser as you move through your slides.  &ldquo;View Source&rdquo;,
links, CSS, screen readers, and search work as they should because
it&rsquo;s all still web-native HTML.  And since it&rsquo;s just text and audio,
it&rsquo;s a fraction of the size of a video, which makes it ideal for
mobile devices.</p>
<p>Our prototype uses just 5kb of JavaScript and is available under the
MIT License. There are many open questions; we are looking for a team
of 2-4 students with strong JavaScript skills and an interest in user
experience design to explore ways we can make it better.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gvwilson/browsercast">Browsercast</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Marimo and H5P</h2>
<p>Marimo is a next-generation computational notebook that enables data
scientists to mix code, discussion, and results in a reproducible way.
Its plugin system relies on AnyWidget, which specifies a simple
contract between extensions and Marimo&rsquo;s rendering and execution
engine.</p>
<p>The aim of this project is to design, build, and test a set of Marimo
plugins that can be used for classroom exercises similar to those in
the H5P toolkit: multiple choice, fill in the blanks, and so on. We
are looking for a team of 2-4 students with both JavaScript and Python
skills who have an interest in both user experience design and
teaching.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://marimo.io/">Marimo Notebook</a></li>
<li><a href="https://anywidget.dev/">AnyWidget</a></li>
<li>[H5P Content Types][h5]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dragnet</h2>
<p>One type of exercise that H5P <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> support is adding labels to
diagrams. <a href="https://iezer.github.io/dragnet/">This prototype</a> takes an SVG with some
specially-marked labels, moves those labels to the side, and then lets
the user try to drag them back into the right places.  A deployable
version would need to do a lot more, such as dealing with scaling
transformations; the goal of this project is to turn the demo into
something a classroom teacher could use.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://iezer.github.io/dragnet/">Dragnet</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>A Tutorial Simulation of Network Protocols</h2>
<p><a href="https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/"><em>Software Design by Example in Python</em></a> deliberately ignored
concurrency, partial failure, and everything else associated with
modern distributed applications. The aim of this project is to (start
to) fix that by building scale models of real network protocols such
as TCP and the BitTorrent protocol using either <a href="https://pydes.readthedocs.io/">Py-DES</a> or
<a href="https://simpy.readthedocs.io/">SimPy</a>. The tutorials will use simulators so that the
accompanying lessons could illustrate edge cases in reproducible ways;
making the implementations work on a real network as well will be a
good stretch goal.</p>
<h2>Software Design by Example in Gleam</h2>
<p>For decades, functional programming (FP) has offered an alternative to
the imperative, procedural model used by most languages. As highly
concurrent systems have become the norm, FP&rsquo;s promise of preventing
entire classes of bugs by avoiding mutable state has led a growing
number of programmers to re-examine it, but there is still often a
gulf between the kinds of examples language designers find
interesting and the kinds of things most working programmers build.</p>
<p><a href="https://gleam.run/">Gleam</a> is a modern functional language that runs on the
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/">Erlang/OTP</a> platform (and can also be compiled to
JavaScript). The aim of this project is to translate examples from
<a href="https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/"><em>Software Design by Example in Python</em></a> into Gleam to help
people coming from Python and other mainstream languages understand
how to use FP in practice.</p>

  <p><time datetime="2024-10-14" class="post-date">2024-10-14</time></p>
  <p>Over the weekend I read Kevin Young&rsquo;s book
<a href="https://abolishingfossilfuels.com/"><em>Abolishing Fossil Fuels: Lessons from Movements That Won</em></a>.
The first couple of chapters are an opinionated look at
the current state of fossil fuel politics in the United States;
the next few dive deep into four grassroots victories in US history
(the abolition of slavery, unionization, civil rights, and clean air).</p>
<p>Young&rsquo;s contention is that most popular and scholarly accounts of those victories misrepresent them.
In all four cases,
the people striving for change did not have the majority on their side
until well after they won,
and did not achieve their aims through the ballot box.
Instead,
they succeeded by bringing economic pressure to bear.
(Young quotes one abolitionist as writing,
&ldquo;The quickest way to a white man&rsquo;s conscience is through his pocketbook.&rdquo;)
The lesson Young draws from this is that
present-day attempts to elect environmentally-minded politicians are unlikely to make a difference.
Instead,
decarbonization advocates&rsquo; successes have come from targeting banks and businesses
in ways that make fossil fuels economically risky.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know enough of the history to judge Young&rsquo;s arguments,
and I suspect 99% of readers won&rsquo;t either.
(Union organizers of the 1930s are hardly household names.)
His version of history rings true, though,
and leaves me wishing for a book like this one
about the successes and failures of the open source, open science, and open data movements.
I don&rsquo;t want polemics, advocacy, or how-to guides:
I&rsquo;ve read (and written) enough of those.
What I want,
and what I think our movements are ready for,
is a set of critical, historically-informed case studies
that analyze how and why specific initiatives won or lost.
If anyone is working on something like this,
please let me know how I can help and thank you in advance</p>

      Browsercast Revisited
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2024-10-12" class="post-date">2024-10-12</time></p>
  <p>Shakespeare wrote sonnets;
we write PowerPoint
A lot of people blame it for bad presentations,
but that&rsquo;s like blaming fountain pens for bad poetry.
The real problem with tools like PowerPoint is that they aren&rsquo;t web-friendly.
When you export a slideshow to present on the web,
what you actually get is a bunch of images.
There&rsquo;s no text,
just pixels arranged in the shapes of letters;
no hyperlinks;
and nothing search engines or disability aids can read.
What&rsquo;s worse,
if you want something people can replay,
you have to make a screencast.
These are just as opaque to search engines and disability aids,
and probably several times larger than the original slides.</p>
<p>A decade ago,
we built a solution called Browsercast
that played audio in sync with an HTML slideshow.
&ldquo;View Source&rdquo;, links, CSS, screen readers, and search worked as they should
because everything was web-native HTML.
And since it was just text and audio,
it was a fraction of the size of a video,
which made it ideal for mobile devices.</p>
<p>Browsercast never caught on,
but I&rsquo;m hoping <a href="https://gvwilson.github.io/browsercast/">this new version</a> will.
It&rsquo;s just 5kb of JavaScript and 1.5kb of CSS,
and,
like its predecessor,
is available under the MIT License.
However,
there&rsquo;s still a lot to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The first challenge is to find a better way to manage replay.
    If the <code>audio</code> element on the first slide doesn&rsquo;t display controls,
    browsers refuse to play any of the sound clips
    because the user hasn&rsquo;t interacted with the page.
    (Try removing <code>control=true</code> from the first <code>audio</code> element
    and then check the error messages in browser&rsquo;s console log to confirm this.)
    This behavior prevents pop-up audio ads,
    but in this case it makes for a poor user experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, we need a better way to manage the audio clips themselves.
    It&rsquo;s easiest for a person to record their presentation as a single audio file,
    but the <code>audio</code> elements in the slides would then need start and end time markers,
    which are annoying to find and copy into the browsercast file.
    On the other hand,
    splitting one file into a couple of dozens short clips
    or recording the presentation in a couple of dozen bursts
    is equally annoying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This prototype replays narration every time a slide comes into view,
    which means the audience hears a clip repeated
    when the presenter backs up to a previous slide.
    The JavaScript could keep track of which clips have already played
    and not replay them unless asked to,
    but should that be controlled by hot keys?
    Or should the audio control on the first slide be repeated on subsequent slides?
    Or should we approach this problem in some other way entirely?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://yihui.org/en/2023/09/snap-slides/">snap-scroll technique</a> for presenting slides
    does not behave gracefully when a slide is too tall to fit on the screen.
    We would like to clip slides to fit the viewport
    and to report clipped slides to authors as they are developing slideshows,
    but need ways to implement and present this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally [sic],
    we need to think about captioning and internationalization.
    Transcripts in different languages can easily be added to slides in hidden elements;
    how should the accompanying audio clips be added,
    and how should users indicate which set of clips they want to hear?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>My thanks to David Seifried,
Jeremy Banks,
David Wolever,
Gabriel Ivanica,
and Rémi Emonet for their work on Version 1,
and to Yihui Xie for inventing the <a href="https://yihui.org/en/2023/09/snap-slides/">snap-scroll technique</a>.</p>

  <p><time datetime="2024-10-11" class="post-date">2024-10-11</time></p>
  <p>Earlier this week
I gave a short presentation to some undergrads at the University of Toronto
on how to be interviewed for internships.
The points I made are listed below;
as always, I&rsquo;d be grateful for feedback.</p>
<h2>Why Should You Listen to Me?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Worked at six universities, a dozen companies, and a non-profit over 40 years</li>
<li>Supervised over 20 undergraduate interns and hired that many again for other people</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Shouldn&rsquo;t You Listen to Me?</h2>
<ul>
<li>I graduated in a tech boom 40 years ago — you are facing the toughest job market I&rsquo;ve ever seen</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re probably not a middle-aged straight white guy</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re probably not applying for the same jobs I would</li>

      First Draft of the Webonomicon
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2024-09-27" class="post-date">2024-09-27</time></p>
  <p>A few months ago I mused about what might go into a lesson on <a href="../2024/06/14/human-scale-software/">human-scale software</a>.
<a href="https://ikasten.io/">Juanan Pereira</a> and I have now sketched a rough outline,
tentatively titled <a href="https://lessonomicon.github.io/webonomicon/">The Webonomicon</a>.
The sections below shows the learner persona,

      A Bag of Hippos
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2024-09-23" class="post-date">2024-09-23</time></p>
  <p><img class="centered" src="../files/2024/pink-hippo.jpg" alt="pink hippo" width="25%"></p>
<p>Back when I was teaching at the University of Toronto,
I used to give little pink hippos to my students as prizes:
I had purchased a bag of 200 for reasons that aren&rsquo;t worth going into,
and this seemed like the best way to get rid of them.</p>
<p>I had a couple or three dozen left by the time I left that job,
so I put them in a bag in my knapsack.
Whenever I saw a kid being unhappy on the streetcar I asked their adult if it was OK to offer them a hippo.
Sometimes the answer was &ldquo;no&rdquo;,
but more often it was &ldquo;Sure, thank you, anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day—I think it was the summer of 2011 but I&rsquo;m not sure—there was a boy of four or five
who was particularly unhappy
and whose mother looked like she was having a particularly stressful day.
I pulled out a hippo and said,
&ldquo;Would this help?&rdquo;
The kid&rsquo;s eyes lit up and his mom said, &ldquo;Sure, thank you.&rdquo;
As he started playing with it on the seat she thanked me again and said,
&ldquo;Of course, he&rsquo;ll lose it as soon as I turn around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No problem,&rdquo; I said,
and I handed her the bag with the remaining hippos
and got off the streetcar without looking back.</p>
<p>Time to make another cup of tea.
If you came in peace, be welcome;
if not, be damned with you.</p>

    <a href="../2024/09/12/writing-project-labels-revisited/">
      Labels for Technical Writing Projects
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2024-09-12" class="post-date">2024-09-12</time></p>
  <p><em>(Originally posted in the <a href="https://ropensci.org/blog/2024/09/12/labels-writing-projects/">rOpenSci blog</a>—my thanks to <a href="https://yabellini.netlify.app/">Yanina Bellini Saibene</a> for editing.)</em></p>
<p>Over the past thirty years I have written five technical books,
co-written three others,
and edited a further six.
Since 2007 they have all lived in GitHub repositories,
as did the first versions of the <a href="https://carpentries.org/">Software Carpentry</a> lessons that I helped to write.</p>
<p>A few months ago I wrote about <a href="../2024/03/07/labels/">the GitHub issue labels I use</a>
for writing projects like these.
As I put that post together,
I realized that I wasn&rsquo;t actually using all of the labels I had created,
and that the problem of choosing good labels for a mixture of code and prose
is more complicated than it seems.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>GitHub only allows one set of labels per project,
    which means that the labels you would want to apply to issues
    are in the same pile as labels you&rsquo;d want to apply to pull requests (PRs).
    This overlap quickly leads to confusion:
    &ldquo;bug&rdquo; is the right label for an issue reporting a problem,
    but doesn&rsquo;t feel appropriate for the PR that fixes the problem.
    (&ldquo;Wait, is this PR adding a bug?&rdquo;)
    Most projects use two different labels (e.g., &ldquo;bug&rdquo; and &ldquo;fix&rdquo;),
    but after going back and forth,
    I&rsquo;ve settled on &ldquo;fix&rdquo; to mean both &ldquo;Please fix this&rdquo; (in an issue)
    and &ldquo;This contains a fix&rdquo; (in a PR).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By default,
    GitHub provides nine labels for issues and PRs.
    Fully a third of these—<code>duplicate</code>, <code>invalid</code>, and <code>wontfix</code>—describe reasons to close an issue
    or discard a PR.
    That seems excessive to me,
    and I feel it&rsquo;s polite to add a sentence or two of explanation as a comment.
    (You have to do this anyway when marking an issue or PR as <code>duplicate</code> to point at what it&rsquo;s duplicating.)</p>
<p><em>Note: I find it a bit ironic that GitHub provides three ways to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; but none for saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.
If I was going to use labels to mark closed issues,
I would include &ldquo;resolved&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;merged&rdquo;.</em></p>
<p><em>Also note: English doesn&rsquo;t have an antonym for &ldquo;mistake&rdquo;, i.e., we don&rsquo;t have a single word
that means, &ldquo;A thing done well.&rdquo;
We sometimes say &ldquo;a score&rdquo; or &ldquo;a win&rdquo; to mean this,
but those are the outcome, not the act itself.
I sometimes wonder what this absence says about English speakers&rsquo; view of the world…</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you create a new project on GitHub,
    you can select any of several widely-used licenses.
    However,
    all of those licenses apply to code:
    the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> licenses for prose (written work) aren&rsquo;t offered.
    I always wind up writing <a href="https://github.com/gvwilson/sql-tutorial/blob/main/LICENSE.md">a custom <code>LICENSE.md</code></a> to say that
    all of the written material is made available under the CC-BY-NC-4.0 license
    while the software is made available under the MIT License.</p>
<p>I mention this here because I find other things missing as well for writing projects.
One of GitHub&rsquo;s default issue labels is &ldquo;documentation&rdquo;,
but I don&rsquo;t think the prose in a lesson or chapter is documentation of code:
the code is there to support the writing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m using in my current writing projects:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>add</td>
<td>(request for) new feature</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>change</td>
<td>exists but could be better</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>code</td>
<td>in software</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>discussion</td>
<td>questions and conversations</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>fix</td>
<td>something is broken</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>good first issue</td>
<td>good for newcomers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>governance</td>
<td>meta-discussion of project management</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>prose</td>
<td>in written content</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>task</td>
<td>one-off task</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>tooling</td>
<td>infrastructure</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>add</code>, <code>change</code>, and <code>fix</code> are meant to be mutually exclusive</li>
<li><code>code</code> and <code>prose</code> can be used together (e.g., a new lesson adds both)</li>
<li><code>discussion</code> and <code>governance</code> are for project management</li>
<li><code>tooling</code> is used for the build system, page templates, etc.</li>
<li><code>task</code> is something that needs to be done once (e.g., &ldquo;publish a release&rdquo;)</li>
<li><code>good first issue</code> is there because we want people to feel welcome</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d enjoy hearing about what you&rsquo;re using—please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">email me</a>
if you&rsquo;d like to start a conversation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Later: someone mailed to ask why I use the &ldquo;NC&rdquo; (non-commercial) clause in my license.
The answer is that I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s sustainable for companies to take lesson material that people have made public
and profit from it without compensating the authors of that material.
If you, as an academic, want to re-use my notes and slides, you are very welcome to do so;
if Elsevier wants to bundle them up in a book and charge students €60 for it,
I want to be able to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;,
or to say, &ldquo;yes, but you have to give me some of that so that I can keep producing this material&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The NC clause is also part of my deal with my publisher (CRC Press):
they are OK with me putting an HTML version of <a href="https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/"><em>Software Design by Example</em></a> and other books online
for people to read for free,
but would <em>not</em> be OK with some other for-profit publisher taking that and republishing it without permission.
I think that&rsquo;s a fair bargain:
people who can&rsquo;t afford to buy the book can read it,
and the publisher can make money from the printed, PDF, and EPUB versions
as compensation for the effort they put into editing and publicizing the book.</p>
<p>Later: a collaborator pointed out an interesting inconsistency.
I follow <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/">Conventional Commits</a> style in my Git commit messages,
so the title line of each commit starts with a single word like &ldquo;fix&rdquo;,
&ldquo;feat&rdquo; (short for &ldquo;feature&rdquo;),
or &ldquo;publish&rdquo; (when all I&rsquo;m doing is rebuilding the HTML version of the lesson).
These words don&rsquo;t line up with the labels I use for issues and PRs:
I don&rsquo;t have a label for &ldquo;publish&rdquo;,
and I use &ldquo;feat&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;add&rdquo; for something new.
I&rsquo;m embarrassed that I didn&rsquo;t notice this before,
and now I need to think about what to do about it…</p>
