      Time Management
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2025-01-03" class="post-date">2025-01-03</time></p>
  <p>My <a href="../2025/01/02/crunch-mode/">previous post</a> explained why people are most productive
when they work at a steady pace and get lots of rest,
and [<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1584322.1584325">Edwards2009</a>] found that
starting assignments early and working consistently predicted good grades.
However,
while people in industry joke that having two bosses means living in hell,
students usually answer to four or five professors
whom don&rsquo;t coordinate due dates across their courses.
I remember a week where I had two major assignments due,
two mid-terms to write,
and a bad cold;
what can you do when this happens to you?</p>
<p>The best solution—or more honestly, the least bad—is to prioritize carefully.
Get a piece of paper and draw a 3×3 grid.
The X axis is effort: label its divisions &ldquo;minutes&rdquo;, &ldquo;hours&rdquo;, and &ldquo;days&rdquo;.
The Y axis is time: label it &ldquo;low&rdquo;, &ldquo;medium&rdquo;, and &ldquo;high&rdquo;.
You should wind up with something like this:</p>
<p><img src="../files/2025/effort-importance.svg" alt="effort-importance grid"></p>
<p>Next,
put everything you need to do somewhere on the grid,
and then throw away the high-effort, low-importance items in the bottom right—you
aren&rsquo;t going to get to those.
You can then start assembling the other items into a schedule,
starting with the upper-left corner.
These are the things that will give the highest return on invested time;
more importantly,
starting with these means that if you&rsquo;ve under-estimated effort,
you will still deliver <em>something</em>.</p>
<p>The tricky items are the ones on the diagonal.
Should you tackle one thing that is high effort and high importance
or three things that are individually less important
but require the same total effort?
Laying things out on a grid can&rsquo;t answer that question,
but at least it can tell you what the question is.</p>
<div class="callout">
<p>How to prioritize:
always finish first the tasks that will allow other people to continue/start/finish their work.
<br>
— <a href="https://yabellini.netlify.app/">Yanina Bellini Saibene</a></p>
</div>
<p>If any task on your list is more than an hour long,
break it down into smaller pieces and prioritize those separately.
Figuring out what those pieces are can take time,
so don&rsquo;t be embarrassed to make &ldquo;plan XYZ&rdquo; a task in its own right.
And remember that the future is approaching at a rate of 24 hours per day:
if something is going to take thirty hours to finish,
you had better allow at least five working days for it,
which means you&rsquo;d better start at least that far ahead of the deadline.</p>
<p>The point of all this organization and preparation is
to be able to immerse yourself in your problem.
[<a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/flow-mihaly-csikszentmihalyi">Csikszentmihalyi1991</a>] popularized the term flow for this;
athletes call it &ldquo;being in the zone&rdquo;,
while musicians talk about losing themselves in what they&rsquo;re playing.
The good news is that you&rsquo;re much more productive in this state
than when you&rsquo;re multi-tasking.
The bad news is that
it takes anywhere from several seconds to several minutes
to get back into this state after an interruption [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11219-010-9104-9">Parnin2010</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2702123.2702156">Borst2015</a>].
In other words,
if you are interrupted half a dozen times per hour
you are <em>never</em> at your productive peak.
Ironically,
the cost of self-interruptions may be even worse than the cost for external interruptions [<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3210459.3210471">Abad2018</a>].</p>
<div class="callout">
<p><strong><em>Open offices suck</em></strong></p>
<p>Open offices were created
so that (mostly male) managers could keep an eye on (mostly female) office workers,
and to reduce air conditioning costs [<a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780140169126">Eley1995</a>].
They lower productivity in every other way we can measure [<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2017.0239">Bernstein2018</a>];
sadly,
the same is true of other interruption-rich environments
like your favorite coffee shop.
If you really want to be productive,
you should avoid both.</p>
</div>
<p>Finally,
you will be more productive in the long run if your back doesn&rsquo;t ache,
and being away from the keyboard
gives your brain a chance to reflect on what you&rsquo;ve just been doing.
You should therefore take a five-minute break every hour.
Checking email doesn&rsquo;t count:
get up and stretch,
refill your water bottle,
or go and restack the dishwasher.
You&rsquo;ll be amazed at how often you can solve a problem that&rsquo;s been baffling you for an hour
by taking a short walk.</p>

      Crunch Mode
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2025-01-02" class="post-date">2025-01-02</time></p>
  <p>I&rsquo;m supervising some undergraduate students at the University of Toronto this semester.
It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve done this in almost 15 years,
and it&rsquo;s giving me a chance to re-think and re-write the advice I used to give
when I was doing this regularly.</p>
<div class="callout">
<p>My starting point is [<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icse.2017.20">Sedano2017</a>],
which found that software development projects have nine types of waste:
building the wrong feature or product,
mismanaging the backlog,
rework,
unnecessarily complex solutions,
extraneous cognitive load,
psychological distress,
waiting and multitasking,
knowledge loss,
and ineffective communication.
<em>None of these are software issues,</em>
so if you only think about the code in your project and not about the people writing it,
everything will take longer and hurt more than it needs to.</p>
</div>
<p>I used to brag about the hours I was working.
Not in so many words, of course—I had <em>some</em> social skills—but
I&rsquo;d show up for work around noon,
unshaven and yawning,
and casually mention how I&rsquo;d been up until 6:00 a.m. working on some monster bug.</p>
<p>Looking back,
I can&rsquo;t remember who I was trying to impress.
Instead,
what I remember is how much of the code I wrote in those all-nighters I threw away
once I&rsquo;d had some sleep.
My mistake was to confuse &ldquo;long hours&rdquo; with &ldquo;getting things done&rdquo;.
You can&rsquo;t produce software (or anything else) without doing some work,
but you can easily do lots of work without producing anything of value.
Scientific study of overwork goes back to at least the 1890s—see
[<a href="https://igda.org/resources-archive/why-crunch-mode-doesnt-work-six-lessons-2005/">Robinson2005</a>] for a short, readable summary.
The most important results are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Working more than eight hours a day for more than a couple of weeks of time
    lowers your total productivity,
    not just your hourly productivity—i.e., you get less done <em>in total</em> in crunch mode
    than when you work regular hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working over 21 hours in a stretch
    increases the odds of you making a catastrophic error
    just as much as being legally drunk.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These facts have been verified through hundreds of experiments
over the course of more than a century,
including some on novice software developers [<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8357494">Fucci2020</a>].
The data behind them is as solid as the data linking smoking to lung cancer.
However,
while most smokers will at least acknowledge that their habit is killing them,
people in the software industry still talk and act as if
they were somehow immune to science.
To quote Robinson&rsquo;s article:</p>
<div class="callout">
<p>When Henry Ford famously adopted a 40-hour workweek in 1926,
he was bitterly criticized by members of the National Association of Manufacturers.
But his experiments,
which he&rsquo;d been conducting for at least 12 years,
showed him clearly that cutting the workday from ten hours to eight hours—and
the workweek from six days to five days—increased
total worker output and reduced production cost…
the core of his argument was that reduced shift length meant more output.</p>
<p>…many studies,
conducted by businesses, universities, industry associations and the military,
…support the basic notion that,
for most people,
eight hours a day,
five days per week,
is the best sustainable long-term balance point between output and exhaustion.
Throughout the 30s, 40s, and 50s, these studies were apparently conducted by the hundreds;
and by the 1960s,
the benefits of the 40-hour week were accepted almost beyond question in corporate America.
In 1962,
the Chamber of Commerce even published a pamphlet extolling the productivity gains of reduced hours.</p>
<p>But, somehow, Silicon Valley didn&rsquo;t get the memo…</p>
</div>
<p>I spent two years at a data visualization startup.
Three months before our first release,
the head of development &ldquo;asked&rdquo; us to start coming in on Saturdays.
We were already pulling one late night a week at that point
(without overtime pay—our boss seemed to think that
ten dollars&rsquo; worth of pizza
was adequate compensation for four hours of work)
and most of us were also working at least a couple of hours at home in the evenings.
To no one&rsquo;s surprise,
we missed our &ldquo;can&rsquo;t miss&rdquo; deadline by ten weeks,
and had to follow up our 1.0 release with a 1.1 and then a 1.2
to fix the crash-and-lose-data bugs we&rsquo;d created.
We were all zombies, and zombies can&rsquo;t code.</p>
<p>Hours like these are sadly still normal in many parts of the software industry,
and may actually be worse now that so many people are working from home.
Designing and building software is a creative act that requires a clear head;
it only takes a couple of minutes to create a bug
that will take hours to track down later.
As Robinson writes:</p>
<div class="callout">
<p>Productivity varies over the course of the workday,
with the greatest productivity occurring in the first four to six hours.
After enough hours,
productivity approaches zero;
eventually it becomes negative.</p>
</div>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to quantify the productivity of programmers, testers, and UI designers
[<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-4221-6">Sadowski2019</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3454122.3454124">Forsgren2021</a>],
but five eight-hour days per week has been proven to maximize long-term total output
in every industry that has ever been studied.
There is no reason to believe that ours is any different.</p>
<p>Ah, you say, but that&rsquo;s <em>long-term</em> output.
What about short bursts now and then,
like pulling an all-nighter to meet a deadline?
That&rsquo;s been studied too,
and the results aren&rsquo;t pleasant [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.02544">Fucci2018</a>].
Your ability to think drops by 25 points for each 24 hours you&rsquo;re awake.
Put it another way,
the average person&rsquo;s IQ is only 75 after one all-nighter,
which puts them in the bottom 5% of the population.
Two all nighters in a row and their effective IQ is 50—the level at which
people are considered incapable of independent living.</p>
<p>The catch in all of this is that people usually don&rsquo;t notice their abilities declining.
Just like drunks who think they&rsquo;re still able to drive,
people who are deprived of sleep don&rsquo;t realize that they&rsquo;re not finishing their sentences (or thoughts).
They certainly don&rsquo;t realize that they&rsquo;re calling functions with parameters in the wrong order
or that the reason the tests are failing is that
they&rsquo;ve forgotten to redeploy the application—again.</p>
<p>The first and most important lesson is therefore
to think about what&rsquo;s more important—how much you produce
or how much of a martyr you appear to be—and to pace yourself accordingly.</p>

  <p>A junk &ldquo;study&rdquo; about &ldquo;ghost engineers&rdquo; popped up a few weeks ago claiming that 9.5% of software developers do nothing.
The author, Yegor Denisov-Blanch, has consistently dodged questions about methodology and refused to share data,
but I&rsquo;m willing to bet his work has been seen by more practitioners in the past 30 days
than every careful, peer-reviewed piece of empirical software engineering research published this year.
I think it would be very cool if an enterprising grad student proved this,
i.e.,
estimated the number of times Denisov-Blanch&rsquo;s work has been viewed or mentioned
and compared it to the number of views and mentions of work from ICSE or <em>Empirical Software Engineering</em>.</p>
<p>More importantly,
I think the software engineering research community should ask themselves
why stuff like this gets so much attention when their work doesn&rsquo;t,
and ask themselves what they should do in order to have that kind of impact.
Public health researchers are doing this kind of critical reflection right now
to figure out how anti-vaccination conspiracy theories have displaced actual science in so many people&rsquo;s minds
so that they can fight back;
if people who study software and software developers want to do more than just observe—if they want
to have some actual impact—I think they would do well to look at why bullshit finds such a large audience.</p>

    <a href="../2024/12/27/not-very-scalable/">
      Not Very Scalable
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2024-12-27" class="post-date">2024-12-27</time></p>
  <p>I have been teaching some informal lessons to colleagues based on
the Python version of <a href="../sdxpy/"><em>Software Design by Example</em></a>,
and one thing that has bothered me is the sizing of the diagrams.
It&rsquo;s not too bad in a chapter like <a href="../sdxpy/glob/">this one</a>,
but when those same SVG files are displayed in <a href="../sdxpy/glob/slides/#2">slides like these</a>
they are a bit hard to read.</p>
<p>I thought the solution would be simple:
&ldquo;SVG&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;Scalable Vector Graphics&rdquo;,
so I should just be able to apply a scaling factor via CSS to enlarge the diagrams
when they are displayed in slide files.
(Modifying the source isn&rsquo;t an option:
they are all carefully sized for the print edition,
and I&rsquo;m not going to duplicate 107 diagrams to solve what is in reality a minor annoyance.)</p>
<p>But what scaling factor should I apply and how should I apply it?
I can&rsquo;t specify an absolute width or a page-relative fraction:
the source diagrams have different intrinsic sizes,
so either of those options would result in different diagrams being scaled by different amounts.
Doing this wouldn&rsquo;t actually be so bad if they just contained lines,
but they all have text as well,
and if some of the diagrams are effectively scaled from (for example) 12-point to 15-point
while others are scaled from 12-point to 18-point,
it really stands out.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s worse is that when I scale up the SVG by a fixed amount (e.g., 120%)
it overlaps with the text below it.
A bit of poking around revealed that the browser lays out the text on the slide
using the SVG&rsquo;s original (intrinsic) size,
and <em>then</em> resizes the SVG.
It isn&rsquo;t noticeable if the figure is the last or only thing on the slide,
but that&rsquo;s not always the case.</p>
<p>The best solution so far comes from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/camerondecoster/">Cameron DeCoster</a>,
and relies on the fact that all of these SVG images are contained in <code>figure</code> elements:</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still not perfect:
as the image below shows,
the rescaled figure is no longer centered.
As Cameron explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The centering issue is due to the fact that there&rsquo;s a cyclic dependency between two elements:
the image and the container.
Using flexbox on the figure with center justified content means that
the content of the container (the image) will set the width.
However, we&rsquo;re using a percentage for the width on the image,
which depends on the width of the parent (the container).
The W3C resolves this as stated <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#cyclic-percentage-contribution">here</a>.
The result is that the initial width calculation is performed using the original size of the image,
then the container is centered,
then the image is scaled.
Unfortunately,
that means that the image centering calculation is done with a different width than the image we see,
and things look wonky.</p>

<p>SVG is now 25 years old.
I think &ldquo;scale this up&rdquo; ought to be a lot easier than it is,
but my real gripe is that I have no idea how the average person
would ever figure this out.

    <a href="../2024/12/15/wrapping-up-the-year/">
      Wrapping Up the Year
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2024-12-15" class="post-date">2024-12-15</time></p>
  <p>Another year, another look back.</p>
<h2>What I Did</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I left <a href="../2024/04/05/moving-on/">Deep Genomics</a> and <a href="../2024/04/29/new-job-at-plotly/">joined Plotly</a>,
    where I deleted several hundred GitHub repositories
    and closed several thousand stale issues.
    I still enjoy coding and teaching more than I enjoy managing,
    but most tech companies don&rsquo;t realize they need teachers,
    and most seem uncomfortable when faced with 61-year-olds who want to code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Python version of <a href="../sdxpy/"><em>Software Design by Example</em></a> came out.
    Reviewers seemed to like it,
    but sales and website traffic have been disappointing.
    I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m not working hard enough to get the word out,
    whether long-form prose is out of fashion,
    or whether I&rsquo;m barking up the wrong tree,
    but as <a href="../2024/12/14/snailz/">I wrote</a> a couple of weeks ago,
    I&rsquo;ve shelved <a href="https://lessonomicon.github.io/rsdx/">a planned follow-up</a> as a result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On a related note,
    I wrote <a href="https://lessonomicon.github.io/querynomicon/">a tutorial on SQL</a> for data scientists.
    I started a couple of others,
    but since I don&rsquo;t have an audience or venue lined up,
    I doubt I&rsquo;ll ever finish them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I ran <a href="../t3/">the teaching workshop</a> a couple of times to raise money for <a href="https://www.rainbowrailroad.org/">Rainbow Railroad</a>,
    who need support now more than ever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I appeared on the <a href="https://codeforthought.buzzsprout.com/1326658/episodes/15010367-en-carpentries-for-all-greg-wilson">Code for Thought</a>,
    <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5wS3jB1d3Hq3hhWo4pFunA">CoRecursive</a>,
    and <a href="https://pod.link/1602572955/episode/7de37354dfa00eb3308e523467f410aa">Software Unscripted</a> podcasts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I went to <a href="https://www.scipy2024.scipy.org/">a conference</a> for the first time since COVID
    and visited the <a href="https://www.capbridge.com/">Capilano Suspension Bridge</a> for the first time in fifty years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We wound down <a href="https://neverworkintheory.org/">It Will Never Work in Theory</a> and wrote <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/so/5555/01/10424425/1Ulj1Qa8tJ6">a retrospective</a> about it.
    I still post one-line summaries of interesting papers <a href="../ideas/nwit/">on this site</a>,
    but after fourteen years,
    it was time to acknowledge that
    working programmers aren&rsquo;t going to care about software engineering research in my lifetime,
    and that researchers aren&rsquo;t going to care enough about that to change what they do or how they do it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I ran for the board of the Python Software Foundation and <a href="../2024/07/01/psf-board-nomination/">came seventh</a>.
    In retrospect I&rsquo;m not surprised:
    I haven&rsquo;t really been involved in open source communities in years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I started playing the penny whistle,
    which is the only thing I&rsquo;ve tried that doesn&rsquo;t aggravate my tendon problems.
    I find the sound quite shrill compared to the tenor sax,
    but it&rsquo;s definitely improving my lung capacity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t finish any of the children&rsquo;s books I&rsquo;ve been writing working on for the last few years,
    write any new short stories,
    or find a writing group in Toronto.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I took the family trailbiking for the first time,
    almost had my (regular) bike stolen,
    spent Thanksgiving at the cottage,
    and went to the gym less than I should have.</p>
</li>

<h2>The Year to Come</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect to cross anything off <a href="../2024/10/20/wish-list/">my wish list</a> this year,
but life is full of surprises.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My daughter will finish high school in June and leave home in August to start college.
    I don&rsquo;t know how we&rsquo;re going to fill our evenings and weekends without her,
    but I imagine we&rsquo;ll finally get around to terracing our back yard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be supervising some <a href="https://github.com/gvwilson/browercast/">undergrad</a> <a href="https://github.com/gvwilson/mossball/">projects</a> at the University of Toronto
    for the first time in 15 years.
    I&rsquo;m also going to be speaking at <a href="https://2025.cusec.net/">CUSEC 2025</a>;
    I hope this talk will age better than <a href="../2024/12/01/never-look-back/">my last one</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;d really like to do an internship this summer.
    I understand why tech companies and universities and everyone else aren&rsquo;t geared up for this,
    and I realize it would be unfair of me to take a position
    that might otherwise go to someone trying to start their career
    in the worst job market in my working lifetime,
    but it would be fun to be learning again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Record some videos for <a href="../sdxpy/"><em>Software Design by Example</em></a>?
    Maybe, but it&rsquo;s a lot of work and I&rsquo;m not sure who they would help.
    The same goes for writing some of <a href="../ideas/not-on-the-shelves/2024/">these books</a>;
    I&rsquo;d really like to cross one or two off the list,
    but see my note above about tech companies not realizing how much they need teachers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I probably won&rsquo;t organize <a href="../2024/10/28/what-would-be-in-a-new-aosa/">another volume</a> of <a href="https://aosabook.org/"><em>The Architecture of Open Source Applications</em></a>,
    but if you want to, please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">reach out</a>:
    I&rsquo;d be happy to offer advice and support.
    Similarly,
    I might finish <a href="https://lessonomicon.github.io/webonomicon/">this tutorial</a> on human-scale web development if I can find a writing partner;
    please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">email me</a> if you&rsquo;d like to help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to keep trying to write fiction,
    but without peers to write for or the prospect of a market,
    it&rsquo;s hard to stay motivated.
    The same holds for the penny whistle:
    if I don&rsquo;t find a teacher or a group to play with, I probably won&rsquo;t stick with it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
