      Resilience Advice
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2025-03-12" class="post-date">2025-03-12</time></p>
  <p>I wish we didn&rsquo;t have to talk about this,
but given the Trump administration&rsquo;s brutal assault on science
and its equally brutal bullying of scientists,
we need to start making plans.
What happens if they come for you, your research, and your data?
What happens if Nadella doesn&rsquo;t kiss ass hard enough or fast enough
and Musk gets a judge to restrict access to GitHub?
(It wouldn&rsquo;t be hard:
find a repository with some DEI-related content or copyrighted material and say,
&ldquo;Turn it off until everything can be reviewed.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>I wish there were more training programs like <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/learning-reflections/keeping-those-on-the-front-lines-of-change-safe-five-years-of-the-ford-foundation-grantee-safety-program/">this one</a>.
Until there are,
here are my thoughts on what you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accept that the threat is both real and random.<ul>
<li>Nobody at the Climate Research Unit thought they were might be a target until <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatic_Research_Unit_email_controversy">Climategate</a> happened.<ul>
<li>Ask Anthony Fauci how safe he feels these days…</li>
<li>…or anyone involved in reproductive health care for women in the US.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a continuum of risk, but everyone in science in the US is now at risk.</li>
<li>And the damage might spread:
    Canada&rsquo;s previous Conservative prime minister <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/second-opinion-scientists-muzzled-1.4588913">muzzled scientists</a>,
    and the current Conservative leader will undoubtedly go further if he wins the upcoming election.</li>
<li>As with censorship, the turmoil is the point: hurt a few to frighten the rest into acquiescence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Threat models (taken from <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008563">this paper</a> with modifications):<ul>
<li>Casual threat (&ldquo;drive by&rdquo;): opportunistic but not determined (but see &ldquo;institutional threat&rdquo; below).</li>
<li>Intimate threat: a life partner (not a big one for this conversation).</li>
<li>Insider threat: &ldquo;inside the fortress&rdquo; (i.e., the departmental sys admin is a DOGE appointee or MAGA sympathizer).</li>
<li>Institutional threat: the rules change and now you&rsquo;re a target: this was loony tunes two months ago and is now our reality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Recognize that getting people to adopt secure habits is as hard as getting people to practice safe sex was in the 1980s.<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Security theatre&rdquo; on the part of institutions is a big part of the problem.</li>
<li>&ldquo;We will send your performance review as a Word document&rdquo; practically trains people to be unsafe.</li>
<li>Programmers have made security needlessly painful.<ul>
<li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1251421.1251435">&ldquo;Why Johnny Can&rsquo;t Encrypt&rdquo;</a> was published a quarter of a century ago and nothing has gotten easier.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Immediate actions (in order):<ol>
<li>Don&rsquo;t open that attachment, install that software, or click on that link without checking.<ul>
<li>Or talk to the &ldquo;journalist&rdquo; who just cold-called you without verifying their credentials.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Put open licenses on everything you can, make sure colleagues have copies, and <a href="https://sciop.net/datasets/">copy their data and code</a> return.<ul>
<li>This isn&rsquo;t just about human threats: talk to anyone who lost work because of Hurricane Katrina.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use a password manager (I recommend <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>),
    two-factor authentication,
    and <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> (it&rsquo;s the only trustworthy messaging app out there).</li>
<li>Identify services you could migrate to,
    e.g., <a href="https://www.sync.com/">Sync</a> (hosted in Canada) and <a href="https://whereby.com/">Whereby</a> (in Norway) instead of Dropbox and Zoom (US).</li>
<li>Ask (require) IT to make &ldquo;what if&rdquo; plans <em>and test them out</em>.<ul>
<li>E.g., make nightly backups of your GitHub issues (which aren&rsquo;t stored in the Git repositories),
your Slack conversations,
and everything in your Google Drive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lobby your professional association to put policies and plans in place <em>and enforce them</em>.<ul>
<li>The Royal Society&rsquo;s decision not to expel Musk was as shortsighted as it was cowardly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And now a request:
if you are taking steps like these right now,
I would be very grateful if you could <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">share your experience</a>
(or better yet, a checklist of what you&rsquo;ve done that other people could do).
I&rsquo;m not looking for &ldquo;we could X&rdquo;, &ldquo;you should Y&rdquo;, or &ldquo;maybe it&rsquo;s time to think about Z&rdquo;,
but rather a list of what you&rsquo;ve done and what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>

      What We Mean by Software Design
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2025-03-08" class="post-date">2025-03-08</time></p>
  <p>Suppose you are building a static site generator that turns a bunch of Markdown files into HTML pages.
The Markdown files include links to external sites;
to ensure these are consistent between pages,
you have decided to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>All links to external sites are written as <code>[text][some_key]</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The keys and their associated URLs are stored in a YAML file like this:
    <div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>- key: first
  url: https://first.site
- key: second
  url: https://second.site
</code></pre></div></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The static site generator reads the YAML file and converts the content to a block of text
    like the one shown below,
    then appends that text to each Markdown file in memory before translating to HTML:
    <div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>[first]: https://first.site
[second]: https://second.site
</code></pre></div></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now comes the hard part.
Your static site generator includes a linting tool that checks for common mistakes,
such as improperly-nested headings or undefined bibliography references.
You want to check that every link reference corresponds to an entry in the YAML file
and that everyone entry in the YAML file is used at least once.
Your first attempt uses a regular expression to find patterns of the form <code>[some][url]</code> in the Markdown,
then does the obvious two-sided check with the URLs.
However,
your Markdown files also include snippets of Python code;
these may contain chained subscripts like <code>grid[x][y]</code>,
which cause your linter to produce spurious error reports.
What should you do?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Implement some sort of &ldquo;known problem&rdquo; list to suppress the spurious error messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use regular expressions to erase code chunks from your Markdown files before searching for link references.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait until the Markdown has been converted to HTML,
    then walk the DOM tree and check all the text that isn&rsquo;t in code chunks.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution #1 requires users to do extra work (and re-work as their content changes),
so let&rsquo;s set it aside.
It&rsquo;s easier to implement a first version of Solution #2 than of Solution #3,
but Solution #2 turns out to be surprisingly tricky to get right:
Markdown allows for indented code blocks,
and inline code sections might be marked with <code>&lt;code&gt;…&lt;/code&gt;</code> rather than with single backticks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are other solutions,
some of which may be better than the ones I&rsquo;ve outlined,
but the point of this post is that when I say &ldquo;software design&rdquo;,
what I mean is &ldquo;answers to questions like these and the justifications behind them&rdquo;.
I wish there were more worked examples that discussed the pros and cons of possible solutions—I feel like
I still have a lot to learn.</p>

  <p>There&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; to know.
You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say.
Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong,
if you aren&rsquo;t positive yourself.
Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words…although
I&rsquo;ve seen scripts where I know words weren&rsquo;t spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all.
So I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s too important.
Anyway, you come to the last page you write in &lsquo;Fade out&rsquo;

      Human Connection
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2025-01-26" class="post-date">2025-01-26</time></p>
  <p>I was an enthusiastic proponent of MOOCs (self-paced online video courses) when they first appeared.
Like many people,
I believed that recording the best teachers in the world
and putting those recordings online with auto-graded exercises
would democratize education on a global scale.
I eventually realized that I was guilty of a category error:
the real divide in teaching and learning isn&rsquo;t in-person versus online,
but interactive versus directive.
If you and I are riffing off each other&rsquo;s ideas in real time,
it doesn&rsquo;t matter (much) if we&rsquo;re sitting side by side or on a video call:
we have a human connection that isn&rsquo;t present if you record a video for me to watch
or write a book for me to read.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this as I&rsquo;ve been doing reviews on <a href="https://www.scribophile.com/">Scribophile</a>,
teaching myself <a href="https://gleam.run/">Gleam</a> on <a href="https://exercism.org/">Exercism</a>,
supervising some <a href="../projects/">undergraduate students</a> at the University of Toronto,
and trying to figure out how I feel about AI coding tools:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Doing reviews&rdquo; means commenting other people&rsquo;s work as well as posting my own fiction,
    because doing the former is the only way to earn the points needed to do the latter.
    It&rsquo;s a simple, transparent, and remarkably effective mechanism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m not actually &ldquo;teaching myself&rdquo; on Exercism.
    Instead,
    I&rsquo;m being taught indirectly by the people who have contributed exercises for me to do
    and by those other learners who have posted their solutions for me to compare mine against.
    I don&rsquo;t have to post mine or take part in communal code reviews in the way that I do on Scribophile,
    but I learn a lot faster (and enjoy learning more) if I do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the students I&rsquo;m working with use AI tools
    as frequently and un-self-consciously as the students I had 15 years ago used Stack Overflow.
    One of them said it&rsquo;s like pair programming with someone who knows a lot but thinks he knows everything;
    another student I spoke to at <a href="https://2025.cusec.net/">CUSEC</a> a couple of weeks ago said that
    she mostly uses AI for &ldquo;why not?&rdquo; questions,
    as in,
    &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t this piece of code work?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m really intrigued by <a href="https://getunblocked.com/">Unblocked</a>,
    which uses LLM technology to answer questions about legacy code bases.
    Why do we have to test these three conditions in this precise order?
    Why do we have to repeat this configuration value in two places?
    Unblocked can answer these questions as well as
    someone who worked on the code two years ago and hasn&rsquo;t touched it since,
    but only if it&rsquo;s fed the whole conversation:
    code review comments, chat, docs, and everything else.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What ties all these together in my mind (this morning at least) is that &ldquo;interactive vs. directive&rdquo; continuum.
Are LLMs just (or &ldquo;just&rdquo;) a way to interact with other people indirectly?
When I ask an LLM a question,
its answer is a statistical amalgam of answers that people I&rsquo;ve never met might have given;
should I put that in the same mental bucket as viewing other people&rsquo;s exericse solutions on Exercism,
reading other people&rsquo;s answers to questions on Stack Overflow,
or looking through old chat logs and code review comments?
It certainly feels more like that to me than watching a video or reading a blog post like this one.</p>
<p>I realize that LLMs only provide the illusion of a human connection,
but does that have to be the case?
Can an LLM be an extra voice when <a href="https://youtu.be/2LbuoxAy56o">a group of students debate each other</a>
rather than a substitute for person-to-person interaction?
Can the AI in my IDE tell me who on the team I should talk to
rather than trying to be spicy auto-complete?
I think that investigating those questions will help us avoid making
the same kind of category error I made all those years ago.</p>

  <p>Everyone knows the story:
Lucy keeps telling Charlie Brown he can kick the football and then pulls it away at the last moment,
while Charlie Brown keeps trying because he&rsquo;s just not very smart.
But there are two other versions of the story.
In one,
Charlie Brown knows Lucy will pull the ball away
but keeps trying to kick it
because he has internalized everything people have said about him
and believes repeated disappointment is all he deserves.
In the other,
he&rsquo;s waiting for Lucy to grow bored and ask,
&ldquo;Why do you keep trying?&rdquo;
so that he can say,
&ldquo;Because I love you and am here to help you get past this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the outside, it&rsquo;s hard to tell these stories apart.</p>

  <p>This series of posts is about course projects designed to prepare students for real jobs.
How companies get this wrong contributes to how they sometimes build things that harm society
(and embarrass their creators).
It easy to avoid these mistakes if you are willing to look beyond the code you write;
that first step is often the hardest,
but I hope this discussion will help.</p>
<h2>How Tech Companies Get Hiring Wrong</h2>
<p>In 1905,
Harvard began selecting students based on their College Entrance Exam Board results.
As a result,
Jewish enrolment began to rise,
and by the early 1920s they made up more than a fifth of the incoming class.
This wasn&rsquo;t an outcome the establishment was willing to accept,
but neither were explicit quotas,
so they moved the goalposts [<a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780618773558">Karabel2006</a>].
Admissions officers began asking questions about the &ldquo;character&rdquo; of prospective students,
and the university began asking for personal essays
that could be graded however the university found most convenient.
By 1933,
the rate of Jewish admission was back down to an &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; 15%.</p>
<p>Harvard&rsquo;s decision to turn away more capable people in favor of less capable ones
seems ridiculous if you think that a university&rsquo;s job is to find and train the smartest people it can.
It makes more sense when you realize that
most institutions&rsquo; first priority is to perpetuate themselves:
if it wasn&rsquo;t,
they probably wouldn&rsquo;t still be around.</p>
<p>Similarly,
the hiring process at many tech companies isn&rsquo;t designed to find the best programmers.
Instead,
it is designed (or more often has just evolved)
to find people who are like those doing the hiring.
&ldquo;Cultural fit&rdquo; almost always means &ldquo;like me&rdquo;:
consciously or not,
we are all biased toward those who look like us,
talk like us,
and make the same pop culture references as us,
which has nothing to do with on-the-job ability
[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-295x.102.1.4">Greenwald1995</a>,<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.riob.2009.10.001">Jost2009</a>].</p>
<p>One way this bias shows up is in whiteboard coding questions about linked lists,
dynamic programming,
and other topics from computer science classes on data structures and algorithms.
As <a href="https://hillelwayne.com/">Hillel Wayne</a> discovered when he looked at <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/linked-lists/">their history</a>,
they might have indicated how much experience someone had using C or Pascal in the 1980s,
but they have no more to do with on-the-job performance today
than the essay questions used by Ivy League schools have to do with your ability to learn.
When April Christina Curley,
a recruiter at Google,
began coaching Black students how to prepare for interviews with Google that included questions like these,
the company shut her down—even though
schools like Stanford had been running coaching sessions for their students for years [<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/04/google-hbcu-recruiting/">Tiku2021</a>].</p>
<p>[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/VLHCC.2019.8818836">Behroozi2019</a>,<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3377815.3381372">Behroozi2020a</a>,<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3368089.3409712">Behroozi2020b</a>]
summarize many other things that often go wrong in hiring in tech,
from long delays waiting for feedback
to asking candidates to spend several days working for free on programming assignments.
These aren&rsquo;t just signs of dysfunctional company culture:
they also make hiring harder for some people than others.
For example,
a single parent or someone caring for a relative with chronic illness
may not be able to devote ten hours to an unpaid side project.
If the interview process requires that,
the company is effectively selecting for people who are economically secure and have lots of free time,
which doesn&rsquo;t correlate with how well they can program in a full-time job.</p>
<div class="callout">
<p><strong>A sign of privilege</strong></p>
<p>You probably won&rsquo;t be treated with any more respect on the job than you were while interviewing.
However, when suggested in an early draft of this post that,
&ldquo;If a company does any of these things, go find another one,&rdquo;
one reviewer replied,
&ldquo;It must be nice to be able to walk away.&rdquo;
They were right:
most people aren&rsquo;t as financially secure as me,
so they aren&rsquo;t able to be as finicky about who they work for as I am.
In other words,
I made the same mistake as a team lead who assumed that
since their evenings and weekends were theirs to do with as they wished,
everyone else&rsquo;s would be too.</p>
</div>
<p>As a student looking for your first full-time job
you probably won&rsquo;t have any control over the hiring process,
but seeing whether the company does it well or not
gives you valuable information about how well run it is.
Here are a few positive indicators:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Write inclusive, accessible job ads.</dt>
<dd>[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/a0022530">Gaucher2011</a>] is just one of many studies showing
that gendered wording in job ads reinforces gender inequality in male-dominated occupations.
<a href="http://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/">Gender Decoder</a> and <a href="http://gendermag.org/">GenderMag</a> can help you find bugs like this
in ads and software [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3377811.3380371">Hilderbrand2020</a>].
Tools for finding and eliminating racial bias and other problems aren&rsquo;t as common,
but [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3366792">Washington2020</a>] will tell you what to aim for,
and if <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WebAIM WAVE</a> doesn&rsquo;t give your online job ads a clean bill of health,
please fix the accessibility problems it reports.</dd>
<dt>Post a public description of the hiring process.</dt>
<dd>Does the company share a page with you (or an email)
that lays out what&rsquo;s going to happen in what order,
how much time is expected,
and the principles everything is based on?</dd>
<dt>Use blinded screening.</dt>
<dd>Everyone has implicit biases,
and many of the rules scientists follow when running experiments are designed
to prevent such biases contaminating their results.
The same is true of hiring;
for example,
companies should redact things like a candidate&rsquo;s age, race, and gender
when circulating resumes for internal review.</dd>
<dt>Use diverse interview panels.</dt>
<dd>Giving people from under-represented backgrounds a say in who&rsquo;s hired next
gives other people with similar backgrounds a better chance of being treated fairly.</dd>
<dt>Have candidates solve realistic problems with their preferred tools.</dt>
<dd>Most programmers have laptops,
and video calls are now a part of everyday life in industrialized countries,
so there&rsquo;s no reason <em>not</em> to give people an hour to show what they can do using the IDE of their choice.
There is also no reason to stop them using online search or AI tools while they do this:
every working programmer relies on our external collective memory,
so telling a candidate they can&rsquo;t during an interview
is like telling a chef to make a meal without using saucepans or knives.</dd>
</dl>
<p>These guidelines apply to school and courses as well.
Are course descriptions and course websites inclusive?
Are instructors required to use blinded grading to ensure that personal likes and dislikes don&rsquo;t affect grades?
If the answers are &ldquo;no&rdquo;, what can you and your classmates do to fix things?</p>
<div class="callout">
<p><strong>Questions to ask</strong></p>
<p>I have interviewed people who didn&rsquo;t ask a single question about the company,
what an average day would look like, or how their career might evolve.
<a href="https://jvns.ca/">Julia Evans</a> has a good list of <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2013/12/30/questions-im-asking-in-interviews/">questions to ask in interviews</a>,
and <a href="https://another.rodeo/">T. Carter Baxter</a> has <a href="https://github.com/tBaxter/questions-for-employers">another</a>.
There won&rsquo;t be time to get to them all,
but asking two or three will impress your interviewer
as well as giving you valuable information.</p>
</div>
<h2>On the Job</h2>
<p>Unfair treatment doesn&rsquo;t end after people are hired.
Study after study has shown that men and women are treated differently on the job:
women have to work twice as hard to be given half as much credit,
they are listened to less often or given less credit for new ideas,
and what is seen as confidence in men is seen as pushiness or stridency in women [<a href="https://hbr.org/2017/12/what-research-tells-us-about-how-women-are-treated-at-work">Gavett2017</a>].
People of color are undermined and discounted in the same way in majority-white workplaces in Europe and North America,
and discrimination based on race, faith, and caste are endemic in the rest of the world as well.</p>
<p>Many companies have taken steps to remedy this during hiring.
However,
hiring more people from under-represented groups doesn&rsquo;t make a difference
if they have to work twice as hard to be taken half as seriously,
if they are constantly passed over for promotion,
or if discussions about promotion continue to take place in the men&rsquo;s locker room
after the department&rsquo;s Friday afternoon hockey game.
There are no easy fixes to these problems,
but there are things you can ask for even as a junior hire:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Share data on how well the company has been doing recently.</dt>
<dd>It&rsquo;s reasonable to ask what proportion of a company&rsquo;s staff (technical and otherwise)
come from under-represented backgrounds
and about the average length of stay at the company.
If the interviewer doesn&rsquo;t know the answer,
they should be able to get it;
if the company doesn&rsquo;t have that data or won&rsquo;t share it,
you&rsquo;ve just learned something.
(However,
see the note above about my privilege:
I can afford to make an interviewer uncomfortable
in a way that most juniors looking for their first job cannot.)</dd>
<dt>Have an org chart.</dt>
<dd>As I said when talking about <a href="../2025/01/06/making-decisions/">making decisions</a>,
every organization has a power structure:
the only question is whether it&rsquo;s public and accountable
or whether the organization runs on who you know and how willing people are to barge in on strangers.</dd>
<dt>Have written criteria for performance reviews.</dt>
<dd>This is a legal requirement in many places,
and these are something a company can share before hiring you.
(Asking for them is a good way to impress interviewers.)
If a company doesn&rsquo;t have criteria,
or if performance reviews are only done when an employee asks for one,
the system is once again biased toward extroverts and the well-connected.</dd>
<dt>Specify how much time employees can take off.</dt>
<dd>Some tech companies have an &ldquo;unlimited vacation&rdquo; policy,
meaning that employees can take as much time off as they want as long as their work gets done.
This sounds attractive,
but <a href="https://library.namely.com/hr-mythbusters-2017">people actually take <em>less</em> time off</a> under these policies
than the legal minimum in most jurisddictions,
both because they feel guilty and because they worry about taking too much.
It also saves companies money:
the company has to compensate people for unused vacation days if the person is laid off,
but not if there&rsquo;s no target.</dd>
