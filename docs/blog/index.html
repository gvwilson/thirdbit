      Long Evenings

  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2024-12-12" class="post-date">2024-12-12</time></p>
  <p>When my brother and I cleaned out my mum&rsquo;s place,
I brought home a slab of fudge that she had made shortly before she died.
She was supposed to come to Ontario that month,
and my guess is that she&rsquo;d planned to bring it for me as a surprise for my birthday.
I just ate the last piece of it,
and it reminded me of how long the evenings sometimes were when I was growing up.
The sun didn&rsquo;t just set, at least not in the summer.
Instead,
the light ebbed little by little,
so gradually that you barely noticed it was getting darker
until something—a store closing or a light coming on in a window—made you realize
that another day had ended.</p>
<p>Time to make another cup of tea.
If you came in peace, be welcome.</p>

  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2024-12-08" class="post-date">2024-12-08</time></p>
  <p>I caught up with some former colleagues this week,
and one of the questions that came up was,
&ldquo;What would you do if you could have any job you wanted?&rdquo;
I have two answers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A &ldquo;scholar in residence&rdquo; position where I spend my time connecting people,
    mentoring junior colleagues and their projects,
    and generally trying to nudge the world (or at least my corner of our profession)
    in a slightly healthier direction.
    I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed this,
    and while <a href="https://aosabook.org/"><em>The Architecture of Open Source Applications</em></a>
    and <a href="https://neverworkintheory.org/">It Will Never Work in Theory</a> didn&rsquo;t become what I hoped they would,
    other ideas might.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A mid-level developer position building software for scientists.
    I say &ldquo;for scientists&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s so rewarding,
    &ldquo;building&rdquo; because I miss being neck-deep in code,
    and &ldquo;mid-level&rdquo; because I&rsquo;d really like to learn
    a few of the things that slid by me over the past twenty years.
    <a href="https://gleam.run/">Gleam</a>?
    <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a>?
    <a href="https://marimo.io/">Marimo</a>?
    <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>?
    It wouldn&rsquo;t really matter as long as I felt every day
    that I understood something I hadn&rsquo;t understood the day before.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I could combine these two roles
because I always put programming to the side if I&rsquo;m managing and networking.
I also think that it would be easier for me to get the first role than the second:
our industry doesn&rsquo;t know what to do with people who want to take (what is viewed as)
a step down in their career for personal satisfaction.</p>
<p>The most surprising thing is that &ldquo;teaching full-time&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t on my list
for the first time in two decades.
I built <a href="https://lessonomicon.github.io/querynomicon/">a tutorial on SQL</a> earlier this year,
and started on three others,
but it feels a bit like wandering the halls in my old high school.
I don&rsquo;t know anything well enough to teach it
that I didn&rsquo;t already know ten or fifteen years ago;
while there&rsquo;s a lot to be said for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xR50ty5DZ0">playing the standards</a>,
my daughter will be moving out in a few months to start college,
and I need to find something to occupy my mind when she does.</p>
<p>p.s. one other thing I&rsquo;d put on the wish list is an office within cycling distance.
I miss being able to grab a coffee with my co-workers once or twice a week…</p>

  <p><time datetime="2024-12-03" class="post-date">2024-12-03</time></p>
  <p>I have read the following recent-ish books about software engineering management
(or in a few cases, read the first couple of chapters and just skimmed the rest).
For the most part they treat the Silicon Valley model as a given,
and if they touch on things like labor rights
or what systemic discrimination reveals about how the system actually works,
they do so only in passing.
If you know of other books that are specifically about managing software development teams,
were published after 2010,
and grapple with <a href="../2018/11/24/afraid-of-change/">things VCs would rather not talk about</a>,
I&rsquo;d be grateful for pointers.</p>

      Never Look Back

  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2024-12-01" class="post-date">2024-12-01</time></p>
  <p>I gave a keynote at <a href="http://cusec.net/">CUSEC</a> in 2010 about evidence-based software engineering.
A recording was available on Vimeo for several years,
but it disappeared some time after 2016.
A few days ago,
though,
I got mail out of the blue from someone who had found a copy.
They shared it with me in case I wanted to post it somewhere,
so I downloaded it and watched it through,
and now I feel a little bit sad.
In increasing order:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A lot of what I said was wrong,
    either because the claims I made were stronger than they should have been
    or because the science itself has turned out to be flawed.
    (Stereotype threat, anyone?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was rude to a couple of people in order to get laughs from the audience.
    I don&rsquo;t expect any of them will read this,
    but if they do,
    I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really did believe things would get better.
    They haven&rsquo;t:
    students don&rsquo;t learn any more about research practices or empirical results in software engineering today
    than they did fifteen years ago,
    and programmers in industry are just as oblivious as they ever were.
    I really did think that <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/making-software/9780596808310/"><em>Making Software</em></a> and <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/so/2024/03/10424425/1Ulj1Qa8tJ6">It Will Never Work in Theory</a>
    would have an impact on more than a few scattered individuals;
    I&rsquo;m disappointed that they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ll post the video in a few days,
but I honestly found parts of it hard to watch.
I&rsquo;ll be speaking at CUSEC again in January;
here&rsquo;s hoping that talk holds up better.</p>
<p>Time to make another cup of tea.
If you came in peace, be welcome.</p>

      More Student Project Proposals
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2024-12-01" class="post-date">2024-12-01</time></p>
  <p>Six weeks ago I posted some <a href="../2024/10/18/student-project-proposals/">undergraduate software projects</a>
that I would be excited about supervising.  Two of those—Browsercast
and the Marimo plugins—have been picked up by students at the
University of Toronto.  The other three are still available, and I&rsquo;ve
added a couple of others (see below). If you&rsquo;re a senior looking for
a capstone project or a professor looking for projects with a
supervisor, please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">get in touch</a>.</p>
<h2>Dragnet</h2>
<p>One type of exercise that H5P <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> support is adding labels to
diagrams. <a href="https://iezer.github.io/dragnet/">This prototype</a> takes an SVG with some
specially-marked labels, moves those labels to the side, and then lets
the user try to drag them back into the right places.  A deployable
version would need to do a lot more, such as dealing with scaling
transformations; the goal of this project is to turn the demo into
something a classroom teacher could use.</p>
<h2>Tutorial Simulations of Distributed Systems</h2>
<p><a href="https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/"><em>Software Design by Example in Python</em></a> deliberately ignored
concurrency, partial failure, and everything else associated with
modern distributed applications. The aim of this project is to (start
to) fix that by building scale models of distributed protocols and
systems from TCP to BitTorrent and load-balancing tools using either
<a href="https://pydes.readthedocs.io/">Py-DES</a> or <a href="https://simpy.readthedocs.io/">SimPy</a>. The tutorials will use simulators
so that the accompanying lessons could illustrate edge cases in
reproducible ways.</p>
<h2>Software Design by Example in Gleam</h2>
<p><a href="https://gleam.run/">Gleam</a> is a modern functional language that runs on the
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/">Erlang/OTP</a> platform (and can also be compiled to
JavaScript). The aim of this project is to translate examples from
<a href="https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/"><em>Software Design by Example in Python</em></a> into Gleam to help
people coming from Python and other mainstream languages understand
how to use FP in practice.</p>
<h2>Parallelizing Marimo Notebooks</h2>
<p><a href="https://marimo.io/">Marimo</a> is a next-generation computational notebook that (a)
stores everything as Python source code and (b) analyzes code to
prevent out-of-order execution of cells. <a href="https://dagster.io/">Dagster</a> and
<a href="https://metaflow.org/">Metaflow</a> are computational workflow tools that allow users
to add decorators to functions and methods to specify computational
chunks. The goal of this project is to see if the two can be married,
i.e., to see if it&rsquo;s possible to add decorators to cell functions in
Marimo to parallelize notebooks directly.</p>
<h2>Extending Lox</h2>
<p>Lox is a simple interpreted language created by Robert Nystrom for his
(excellent) book <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/"><em>Crafting Interpreters</em></a>. Many people have
extended it in various ways; in this project, students would re-create
Lox by working through the second half of Nystrom&rsquo;s book, then add
operator overloading, cooperative concurrency, and a few other features
to bring the language up to par with <a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>.</p>
<h2>Automatic Identification of Variable Roles</h2>
<p>Sajaniemi et al&rsquo;s work on <a href="https://www.ppig.org/files/2005-PPIG-17th-sajaniemi.pdf">roles of variables</a> identified and
named ten small patterns in the way variables are used in novice
programs. This project would build static and dynamic analysis tools
to detect those patterns (and possibly others) in programs as an aid
to teaching, debugging, and code review.</p>
<h2>Entity-Relationship Diagrams for Dataframes</h2>
<p>Entity-relation (ER) diagrams are one of the few graphical notations
that programmers actually use voluntarily.  This project would use
static and dynamic analysis to extract ER diagrams from programs that
use dataframe libraries like <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> and <a href="https://pola.rs/">Polars</a> to
show how dataframes are being combined, e.g., to infer foreign key
relationships.</p>
<h2>The Impact of Calibrated Peer Review</h2>
<p>Give a novice programmer a one-page program and have them score it
using a checklist, then grade them on how closely their scoring
matches the instructor’s. (They start with 100%, and lose one mark for
each false positive or false negative.) After doing this a handful of
times, they should learn to see code through the instructor’s
eyes. Does this help them write better code? If so, how quickly and
how well?</p>

    <a href="../2024/11/30/another-ssg-for-lessons/">
      Another Static Site Generator for Lessons
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2024-11-30" class="post-date">2024-11-30</time></p>
  <p>I built a very simple static site generator (SSG) called <a href="https://github.com/lessonomicon/mccole">McCole</a>
to support the lessons I mentioned in <a href="../2024/11/24/unfinished-projects/">my previous post</a>.
I could have stuck with <a href="https://www.dmulholl.com/docs/ark/main/">Ark</a>
(which I use to build this site and books like <a href="../sdxpy/"><em>Software Design in Python</em></a>),
but writing my own helped me figure out what I actually need,
and might someday serve as the basis for a tutorial of some sort.
In no particular order, <a href="https://github.com/lessonomicon/mccole">McCole</a>&rsquo;s features are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read configuration from the project&rsquo;s <code>pyproject.toml</code> file.</li>
<li>Convert all the Markdown files in or below the project&rsquo;s root directory to HTML
    using <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/">Jinja</a> templates.</li>
<li>Rename a few files along the way:<ul>
<li><code>README.md</code> becomes <code>index.html</code></li>
<li><code>CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</code> becomes <code>code_of_conduct.html</code></li>
<li><code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> becomes <code>contributing.html</code></li>
<li><code>LICENSE.md</code> becomes <code>license.html</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create an HTML page corresponding to every source code file
    so that (for example) <code>a/b.py</code> is visible online as <code>a/b.py.html</code>.</li>
<li>Replace <code>@root</code> at the start of URLs with the relative path to the site&rsquo;s root directory.</li>
<li>Replace links to Markdown files with links to the corresponding HTML files.
    I do this so that links would work properly when people view the Markdown files on GitHub.</li>
<li>Rewrite the URL in something like <code>[label](b:key)</code> to <code>[label](@root/bibliography.html#key)</code>
    to make it easy for authors to link to bibliographic citations.
    These special links <em>don&rsquo;t</em> work when files are viewed on GitHub,
    but it&rsquo;s a lot less typing that the alternative.
    (I use the <a href="https://github.com/dmulholl/shortcodes">shortcodes</a> package to do this with <a href="https://www.dmulholl.com/docs/ark/main/">Ark</a> sites,
    but after a bit of experimentation I decided to special-case these links in <a href="https://github.com/lessonomicon/mccole">McCole</a>.)</li>
<li>Similarly,
    <a href="https://github.com/lessonomicon/mccole">McCole</a> rewrites <code>[term](g:key)</code> to <code>[term](@root/glossary.html#key)</code>
    so that authors can easily insert glossary references.</li>
<li>If a page contains any glossary references,
    <a href="https://github.com/lessonomicon/mccole">McCole</a> creates a list of defined terms at the top of the page.
    (In my experience,
    this is the most useful way to tell a would-be instructor what the lesson is actually about.)</li>
<li>I tried using shortcodes to format figures consistently,
    but once I decided not to use them for the glossary and bibliography,
    it didn&rsquo;t seem worth keeping them for figures.
    Instead,
    I check their properties during linting (see below).</li>
<li>My tutorials focus on programming,
    so I need to be able to include snippets of source code in pages.
    &ldquo;Snippets&rdquo; makes the problem more complex:
    I often want to include just one function or a couple of methods rather than an entire source file.
    My previous SSG had a couple of hundred lines of code
    to pull sections out of source files in various ways;
    <a href="https://github.com/lessonomicon/mccole">McCole</a> just checks that the text in the Markdown file
    is contained in the source file.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lessonomicon/mccole">McCole</a> defines a class for each inclusion like <code>language-py</code> or <code>language-sql</code>
    so that inclusions from different languages can be styled differently.
    I haven&rsquo;t included syntax highlighting,
    partly because I want to keep this SSG simple
    but also because the highlighting rules I choose probably <em>won&rsquo;t</em> match what learners see
    in their editor or IDE.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lessonomicon/mccole">McCole</a> includes a tool for linting sites,
    i.e.,
    for checking that links resolve,
    glossary entries are mentioned somewhere,
    and so on.
    It turned out to be a lot simpler to check for problems
    than to generate correct content automatically,
    at least for small lessons.
    <a href="https://github.com/lessonomicon/mccole">McCole</a> also uses <a href="https://pypi.org/project/html5validator/">html5validator</a>
    to check the formatting of the HTML pages it generates;
    specific lessons use tools like <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/">ruff</a> to check source code as well.</li>
</ol>
<p>So what <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> <a href="https://github.com/lessonomicon/mccole">McCole</a> include that a full-featured lesson SSG would?
The most important thing is probably some sort of support for exercises:
styling them,
numbering them,
keeping track of solutions,
and so on.
I could also add CSS styling for various kinds of callouts,
but I&rsquo;m not trying to reproduce something like <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/">the Carpentries Workbench</a>:
<a href="https://github.com/lessonomicon/mccole">McCole</a> is a multi-bit screwdriver,
not a fully-equipped machine shop.</p>

<li>Finishing <em>Iffy</em>, <em>All the Other Santas</em>, or the sequel to <em>Maddy Roo</em></li>

</ol>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve learned about myself:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have lots of ideas, most of which don&rsquo;t make as much sense to other people as they do to me.</li>
<li>I start things before I&rsquo;ve thought them through.</li>
<li>I have trouble finishing things (largely because of #2).</li>
<li>I enjoy tinkering with small pieces of software much more than I enjoy contributing to large ones.</li>
<li>I enjoy teaching and mentoring more than I enjoy managing.</li>
<li>I run out of steam when I&rsquo;m working on my own or don&rsquo;t have a specific audience and deadline.</li>
</ol>

  <p>I will be supervising some undergraduate projects at the University of Toronto next semester
for the first time in 15 years.
The map below shows the birthplaces (where I know them) of
the 146 students I supervised or co-supervised between 2002 and 2010;
I&rsquo;m looking forward to adding another few points.</p>
