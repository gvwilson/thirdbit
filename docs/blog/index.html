      A Bag of Hippos
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2024-09-23" class="post-date">2024-09-23</time></p>
  <p><img class="centered" src="../files/2024/pink-hippo.jpg" alt="pink hippo" width="25%"></p>
<p>Back when I was teaching at the University of Toronto,
I used to give little pink hippos to my students as prizes:
I had purchased a bag of 200 for reasons that aren&rsquo;t worth going into,
and this seemed like the best way to get rid of them.</p>
<p>I had a couple or three dozen left by the time I left that job,
so I put them in a bag in my knapsack.
Whenever I saw a kid being unhappy on the streetcar I asked their adult if it was OK to offer them a hippo.
Sometimes the answer was &ldquo;no&rdquo;,
but more often it was &ldquo;Sure, thank you, anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day—I think it was the summer of 2011 but I&rsquo;m not sure—there was a boy of four or five
who was particularly unhappy
and whose mother looked like she was having a particularly stressful day.
I pulled out a hippo and said,
&ldquo;Would this help?&rdquo;
The kid&rsquo;s eyes lit up and his mom said, &ldquo;Sure, thank you.&rdquo;
As he started playing with it on the seat she thanked me again and said,
&ldquo;Of course, he&rsquo;ll lose it as soon as I turn around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No problem,&rdquo; I said,
and I handed her the bag with the remaining hippos
and got off the streetcar without looking back.</p>
<p>Time to make another cup of tea.
If you came in peace, be welcome;
if not, be damned with you.</p>

    <a href="../2024/09/12/writing-project-labels-revisited/">
      Labels for Technical Writing Projects
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2024-09-12" class="post-date">2024-09-12</time></p>
  <p><em>(Originally posted in the <a href="https://ropensci.org/blog/2024/09/12/labels-writing-projects/">rOpenSci blog</a>—my thanks to <a href="https://yabellini.netlify.app/">Yanina Bellini Saibene</a> for editing.)</em></p>
<p>Over the past thirty years I have written five technical books,
co-written three others,
and edited a further six.
Since 2007 they have all lived in GitHub repositories,
as did the first versions of the <a href="https://carpentries.org/">Software Carpentry</a> lessons that I helped to write.</p>
<p>A few months ago I wrote about <a href="../2024/03/07/labels/">the GitHub issue labels I use</a>
for writing projects like these.
As I put that post together,
I realized that I wasn&rsquo;t actually using all of the labels I had created,
and that the problem of choosing good labels for a mixture of code and prose
is more complicated than it seems.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>GitHub only allows one set of labels per project,
    which means that the labels you would want to apply to issues
    are in the same pile as labels you&rsquo;d want to apply to pull requests (PRs).
    This overlap quickly leads to confusion:
    &ldquo;bug&rdquo; is the right label for an issue reporting a problem,
    but doesn&rsquo;t feel appropriate for the PR that fixes the problem.
    (&ldquo;Wait, is this PR adding a bug?&rdquo;)
    Most projects use two different labels (e.g., &ldquo;bug&rdquo; and &ldquo;fix&rdquo;),
    but after going back and forth,
    I&rsquo;ve settled on &ldquo;fix&rdquo; to mean both &ldquo;Please fix this&rdquo; (in an issue)
    and &ldquo;This contains a fix&rdquo; (in a PR).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By default,
    GitHub provides nine labels for issues and PRs.
    Fully a third of these—<code>duplicate</code>, <code>invalid</code>, and <code>wontfix</code>—describe reasons to close an issue
    or discard a PR.
    That seems excessive to me,
    and I feel it&rsquo;s polite to add a sentence or two of explanation as a comment.
    (You have to do this anyway when marking an issue or PR as <code>duplicate</code> to point at what it&rsquo;s duplicating.)</p>
<p><em>Note: I find it a bit ironic that GitHub provides three ways to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; but none for saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.
If I was going to use labels to mark closed issues,
I would include &ldquo;resolved&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;merged&rdquo;.</em></p>
<p><em>Also note: English doesn&rsquo;t have an antonym for &ldquo;mistake&rdquo;, i.e., we don&rsquo;t have a single word
that means, &ldquo;A thing done well.&rdquo;
We sometimes say &ldquo;a score&rdquo; or &ldquo;a win&rdquo; to mean this,
but those are the outcome, not the act itself.
I sometimes wonder what this absence says about English speakers&rsquo; view of the world…</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you create a new project on GitHub,
    you can select any of several widely-used licenses.
    However,
    all of those licenses apply to code:
    the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> licenses for prose (written work) aren&rsquo;t offered.
    I always wind up writing <a href="https://github.com/gvwilson/sql-tutorial/blob/main/LICENSE.md">a custom <code>LICENSE.md</code></a> to say that
    all of the written material is made available under the CC-BY-NC-4.0 license
    while the software is made available under the MIT License.</p>
<p>I mention this here because I find other things missing as well for writing projects.
One of GitHub&rsquo;s default issue labels is &ldquo;documentation&rdquo;,
but I don&rsquo;t think the prose in a lesson or chapter is documentation of code:
the code is there to support the writing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m using in my current writing projects:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>add</td>
<td>(request for) new feature</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>change</td>
<td>exists but could be better</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>code</td>
<td>in software</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>discussion</td>
<td>questions and conversations</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>fix</td>
<td>something is broken</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>good first issue</td>
<td>good for newcomers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>governance</td>
<td>meta-discussion of project management</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>prose</td>
<td>in written content</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>task</td>
<td>one-off task</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>tooling</td>
<td>infrastructure</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>add</code>, <code>change</code>, and <code>fix</code> are meant to be mutually exclusive</li>
<li><code>code</code> and <code>prose</code> can be used together (e.g., a new lesson adds both)</li>
<li><code>discussion</code> and <code>governance</code> are for project management</li>
<li><code>tooling</code> is used for the build system, page templates, etc.</li>
<li><code>task</code> is something that needs to be done once (e.g., &ldquo;publish a release&rdquo;)</li>
<li><code>good first issue</code> is there because we want people to feel welcome</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d enjoy hearing about what you&rsquo;re using—please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">email me</a>
if you&rsquo;d like to start a conversation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Later: someone mailed to ask why I use the &ldquo;NC&rdquo; (non-commercial) clause in my license.
The answer is that I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s sustainable for companies to take lesson material that people have made public
and profit from it without compensating the authors of that material.
If you, as an academic, want to re-use my notes and slides, you are very welcome to do so;
if Elsevier wants to bundle them up in a book and charge students €60 for it,
I want to be able to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;,
or to say, &ldquo;yes, but you have to give me some of that so that I can keep producing this material&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The NC clause is also part of my deal with my publisher (CRC Press):
they are OK with me putting an HTML version of <a href="https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/"><em>Software Design by Example</em></a> and other books online
for people to read for free,
but would <em>not</em> be OK with some other for-profit publisher taking that and republishing it without permission.
I think that&rsquo;s a fair bargain:
people who can&rsquo;t afford to buy the book can read it,
and the publisher can make money from the printed, PDF, and EPUB versions
as compensation for the effort they put into editing and publicizing the book.</p>
<p>Later: a collaborator pointed out an interesting inconsistency.
I follow <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/">Conventional Commits</a> style in my Git commit messages,
so the title line of each commit starts with a single word like &ldquo;fix&rdquo;,
&ldquo;feat&rdquo; (short for &ldquo;feature&rdquo;),
or &ldquo;publish&rdquo; (when all I&rsquo;m doing is rebuilding the HTML version of the lesson).
These words don&rsquo;t line up with the labels I use for issues and PRs:
I don&rsquo;t have a label for &ldquo;publish&rdquo;,
and I use &ldquo;feat&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;add&rdquo; for something new.
I&rsquo;m embarrassed that I didn&rsquo;t notice this before,
and now I need to think about what to do about it…</p>

  <h2 class="post-title">
    <a href="../2024/09/06/how-i-explain-code/">
      How I Explain Code
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2024-09-06" class="post-date">2024-09-06</time></p>
  <p>I recently built a very small static site generator because…
well, the reasons don&rsquo;t matter (and aren&rsquo;t actually compelling),
but sharing it with someone gave me an opportunity to think about
how I explain my code to someone else.
The explanation is below and the code follows;
I hope it&rsquo;s useful.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Start with the <code>main()</code> function</p>
<ul>
<li>Parse command-line arguments and store the result in <code>opt</code></li>
<li>Create an <code>Environment</code> for loading templates (explained below)</li>
<li>Create a set called <code>skip</code> of top-level directories to ignore</li>
<li>Find all the files that need to be rendered or just copied</li>
<li>For each file:<ul>
<li>If it&rsquo;s a Markdown file, render it</li>
<li>Otherwise, copy it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>So what&rsquo; an &ldquo;environment&rdquo;?</p>
<ul>
<li>This program uses Jinja2 to stuff content into HTML templates</li>
<li>Jinja2 needs to know where to find the HTML templates</li>
<li>So we create an <code>Environment</code> with a <code>FileSystemLoader</code>
    and tell that <code>FileSystemLoader</code> where to look</li>
<li><code>opt</code> holds the result of parsing command-line arguments,
    and <code>opt.templates</code> is the path to the templates directory</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s take a look at <code>find_files()</code></p>
<ul>
<li>It returns a dictionary whose keys are file paths
    and whose values are the contents of those files</li>
<li>It uses a dictionary comprehension to do this instead of a loop<ul>
<li>First line of the comprehension specifies key and value</li>
<li>Second line is what to look at</li>
<li>Third is the condition for inclusion</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We use <code>read_file()</code> to read a file<ul>
<li>If the file is a text file, use <code>read_text()</code></li>
<li>Otherwise, use <code>read_bytes()</code> (e.g., for images)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To find files we <em>might</em> be interested in we use a &ldquo;glob&rdquo;<ul>
<li>The name is short for &ldquo;global&rdquo; and is old-fashioned Unix terminology</li>
<li><code>opt.root</code> is the root directory of our project</li>
<li>The pattern <code>**/*.*</code> matches everything in subdirectories (<code>**/</code>)
    with a two-part name (<code>*.*</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The condition in the dictionary comprehension uses a function
    <code>is_interesting_file()</code><ul>
<li>If you&rsquo;re not a file, you&rsquo;re not interesting</li>
<li>If your name starts with <code>.</code> (as in <code>.gitignore</code>),
    you&rsquo;re not interesting</li>
<li>If your suffixes isn&rsquo;t in <code>SUFFIXES</code> (defined at the top of the file),
    you&rsquo;re not interesting</li>
<li>If your parent directory&rsquo;s name starts with <code>.</code> (as in <code>.git</code>),
    you&rsquo;re not interesting</li>
<li>If we have a set of things to skip
    and your path starts with one of those things,
    you&rsquo;re not interesting</li>
<li>Otherwise, OK, fine, you&rsquo;re interesting</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back to <code>main()</code> and the loop over files</p>
<ul>
<li>If the file <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> Markdown, we just copy it</li>
<li>…after making sure the output directory exists</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>And finally, <code>render_markdown()</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Use a library function <code>markdown()</code> to convert Markdown to HTML<ul>
<li><code>MARKDOWN_EXTENSIONS</code> (defined at the top of the file)
    is a list of extra features we want to enable,
    such as Markdown tables</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Next, load the <code>page.html</code> template<ul>
<li>A more sophisticated tool would allow authors to specify a template
    in the header of the Markdown file or as a command-line argument</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then ask the template to take the HTML produced from the Markdown
    and stuff it into the HTML template we just loaded<ul>
<li><code>page.html</code> has a placeholder to show where</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>We could stop here, but we want to fix up the generated HTML a bit</p>
<ul>
<li>So we parse the HTML produced by Jinja2 using Beautiful Soup
    to get a tree of objects in memory (as opposed to a great big string)</li>
<li>And then apply several functions to it in order</li>
<li>Each of these functions take the current document tree
    and returns a modified one</li>
<li>Once that&rsquo;s done, we make sure the output directory exists
    and then write the document tree as HTML text<ul>
<li>Potentially renaming it from upper case to lower case</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>So what are these transformations?</p>
<ul>
<li><code>do_markdown_links()</code> finds hyperlinks to <code>.md</code> files
    and turns them into hyperlinks to <code>.html</code> files<ul>
<li>We write hyperlinks to <code>.md</code> files in the source
    so that files will inter-link correctly when viewed on GitHub</li>
<li>But our final website will have <code>.html</code> files,
    so we need to convert</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>do_root_path_prefix()</code> looks for links whose names start with <code>@root</code>
    and turn them into relative links up to the root directory of the project<ul>
<li>For example, <code>@root/static/page.css</code> becomes <code>./static/page.css</code>
    if the Markdown file in in the root directory of the project
    but <code>../../static/page.css</code> if the file is two levels down</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>do_title()</code> finds the <code>H1</code> heading in the HTML page
    and copies its contents into the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element of the page</li>
<li>We can easily add more transformation functions<ul>
<li>And in fact the full version of this program has transformers
    to handle bibliography citations and glossary references</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In answer to a couple of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>I organize code more-or-less alphabetically out of habit;
    I know people who try to organize in calling order,
    but that breaks down as soon as you have utility functions that are called in multiple places.</li>
<li>I <em>explain</em> code more or less in execution order</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2024-08-12" class="post-date">2024-08-12</time></p>
  <p>I have maintained <a href="../not-on-the-shelves/">a list of unwritten books</a> for over 25 years
(see <a href="../not-on-the-shelves/2024/">this page</a> for the latest version).
It has only recently occurred to me that I should put together
a list of tutorials I would like to attend that apparently don&rsquo;t yet exist.
If you are delivering one of these any time soon,
please let me know;
if you&rsquo;re not,
but might be interested in creating one of them,
please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">get in touch</a>.</p>

<p><em>How to Build a Dashboard Engine</em>
    shows learners how to create tools like <a href="https://dash.plotly.com/">Dash</a> and <a href="https://shiny.posit.co/">Shiny</a>
    that let data scientists build interactive dashboards without writing JavaScript themselves.
    Along the way,
    the tutorial introduces some important ideas about real-world web development:
    for example,
    how to manage long-running server-side processes without the browser freezing up.</p>

<p><em>How to Build a Laboratory Information Management System</em>
    isn&rsquo;t really about building a LIMS—it&rsquo;s about all the design decisions that have to be made along the way,
    from handling authentication and access control
    to representing human workflows in software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>How to Build an Integrated Development Environment</em>
    has participants create a tool using <a href="https://www.textualize.io/">Textualize</a>
    that includes an editor, a breakpointing debugger, and a file browser,
    which will help them understand and use their actual IDE more proficiently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly,
    <em>A Web Browser in a Day</em> is a stripped-down version of <a href="https://browser.engineering/">this excellent tutorial</a>,
    and helps participants understand how their actual browser works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>NumPy from the Ground Up</em>
    builds a (very) simple version of <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a> from scratch
    to give learners a better understanding of how the real thing works.
    Low-level data manipulation could be done in C or Rust,
    or using something like <a href="https://pypi.org/project/bitarray/">bitarray</a> or the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html">array</a> module from Python&rsquo;s standard library
    to be more accessible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And speaking of Rust,
    <em>Rust for Python Programmers</em> is an introduction to a language that might,
    if its community can shed its cryptocurrency baggage,
    be the most important systems programming language of the next twenty years.
    This workshop culminates with participants building a small Python extension in Rust
    and turning it into a shareable package.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>What Every Data Scientist Needs to Know About Deploying an Application</em>
    addresses the same need as <a href="https://gvwilson.github.io/sys-tutorial/">this unfinished tutorial</a>:
    what do people who <em>aren&rsquo;t</em> sys admins need to know in order to put an application into production?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Product Management for Open Source</em>
    teaches exactly that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally,
    <em>Organizational Change for Software Developers</em> also teaches exactly what the title says.
    As I&rsquo;ve said many, many times before,
    open source and open science can&rsquo;t win unless and until we figure out
    how to change the organizations we&rsquo;re in,
    and we don&rsquo;t need to figure that out from scratch.</p>

    <a href="../2024/07/01/psf-board-nomination/">
      Python Software Foundation Board Nomination
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2024-07-01" class="post-date">2024-07-01</time></p>
  <p><em>Update: congratulations to Tania Allard, KwonHan Bae, and Cristián Maureira-Fredes on being elected to the PSF Board.</em></p>
<p>I have put myself forward as a candidate for election to the board of
the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf-landing/">Python Software Foundation</a>.
My pitch is below;
no matter what happens,
I hope I&rsquo;ll be able to continue to serve the community that has given me so much over so many years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Python has been an important part of my life for a quarter of a century,
so I would be grateful for a chance to serve its community as a member of the PSF board.
I believe my experience has prepared me for doing so effectively:
I co-authored the PEP that added sets to the language,
am a Fellow of the PSF,
helped make Python the first-year teaching language at Canada&rsquo;s largest university,
and have written several books showing how to apply it to real-world problems.</p>
<p>I also launched and then led a non-profit organization called Software Carpentry
that now has thousands of instructors running workshops on basic computing skills in dozens of countries.
Building that gave me first-hand experience of the challenges that non-profit organizations face;
I hope that what I learned about fundraising, governance, community management, committee work,
and managing changes in leadership
will allow me to contribute to the PSF in meaningful ways.</p>
<p>My other reason for nominating myself is that I don&rsquo;t like to leave things half-done.
The first generation of open source contributors proved that
volunteers working together can create world-class infrastructure and tools,
but we are still struggling to make such work a viable career.
Many people struggle to balance their desire to contribute with their need to pay their bills,
while other simply burn out.
If elected,
I hope to help the PSF take the lead in tackling the sustainability crisis,
and by doing so,
help ensure that the Python community grows and thrives. </p>

      Human-Scale Software

  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2024-06-14" class="post-date">2024-06-14</time></p>
  <p>I recently posted on Mastodon:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>I&rsquo;m going to write another tech book.</li>
<li>If I do, it will be about evidence-based software engineering and/or how big tech companies operate like drug cartels.</li>
<li>But I&rsquo;m still thinking about &ldquo;Human-Scale Software: A Guide for the 99.9% of Developers Who Don&rsquo;t Need Scalability&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>So what would I use for #3?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> for storage.
    (<a href="https://duckdb.org/">DuckDB</a> is cool, but I&rsquo;m being deliberately conservative in my choices.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t use an object-relational mapper:
    I&rsquo;ve used <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> for years,
    but I think embedded SQL is easier to debug than an ORM for small-to-medium use cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://bottlepy.org/">Bottle</a> on the back end
    because it has stayed small while <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/">Flask</a> keeps growing.
    Note that I wouldn&rsquo;t use type hints in the Python code:
    if I wanted to write Java, I&rsquo;d write Java.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.dmulholl.com/docs/ibis/master/">Ibis</a> templates because they&rsquo;re simpler than <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/">Jinja</a>.
    (See also <a href="../2024/02/25/community-norms/">this post</a>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://mamba.readthedocs.io/">mamba</a>, <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/">ruff</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a> for Python tooling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://alpinejs.dev/">Alpine.js</a> as a front-end framework
    because <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a> feels a bit left-field
    and <a href="https://react.dev/">React</a> and <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a> seem bent on cosplaying Enterprise Java.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a>, <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a>, and <a href="https://standardjs.com/">StandardJS</a> for JavaScript tooling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://ui.mantine.dev/">Mantine</a> for the UI,
    though I could be persuaded to stick to <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pa11y.org/">Pa11y</a> for accessibility testing
    (because <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/standalone">the standalone version of WebAIM WAVE</a> costs US$4000/year).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> for deployment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This list deliberately isn&rsquo;t <a href="../2024/04/18/a-new-stack/">an entirely new stack</a>,
but it&rsquo;s also not entirely conservative.
I know it should include a security auditing tool to sit beside Pa11y,
but while I&rsquo;ve watched people use <a href="https://snyk.io/">Snyk</a>
I don&rsquo;t have any experience with it or alternatives.</p>
<p>So much for tools:
what would I teach?
My learner persona is:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Carter has a BSc in bioinformatics
    and now works as a data scientist for a mid-sized therapeutics company.</li>
<li>They know Python well enough to analyze data for their colleagues
    and build dashboards using <a href="https://dash.plotly.com/">Dash</a>,
    but only ever did a couple of assignments using JavaScript.</li>
<li>Carter wants to build something to replace their company&rsquo;s aging PHP-based record keeping tools.</li>
<li>Carter has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_tremor">idiopathic tremor</a>
    that sometimes makes fine motor control difficult.
    As a result,
    they find many websites awkward or impossible to use
    and strongly prefer typing to using a mouse or a touch screen,</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The motivating example would be a <em>laboratory information management system</em> (LIMS)
    designed to handle field samples and laboratory experiments.
    Luckily,
    I already have <a href="https://github.com/gvwilson/snailz">a synthetic data generator for this</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Database schema design</em>:
    I&rsquo;d start with something simple and extend it chapter by chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>…which means the list above should have included a <em>database migration</em> tool like <a href="https://sqitch.org/">Sqitch</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building a <em>command-line user interface</em> (CLUI) for administration, batch operations, and testing.
    (Crap, that means adding <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/">pytest</a> and <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/">Click</a> to the list of tools.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Authentication</em>:
    it&rsquo;s straightforward to add this to the CLUI,
    but will require something like <a href="https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/">Flask-Login</a> for the web UI.
    I don&rsquo;t know of a framework-agnostic alternative,
    so I might have to revisit my decision to use Bottle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Routing URLs</em> to handler functions
    (and redirecting when authentication is needed).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Permissions</em>,
    which means <em>user roles</em>.
    Again,
    <a href="https://flask-user.readthedocs.io/">Flask-User</a> does this and I don&rsquo;t know of a framework-agnostic alternative,
    so yeah, Flask…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Generating pages from templates</em> and <em>form handling</em>.
    I hope we&rsquo;ve all outgrown single-page applications,
    so <em>site architecture design</em> as a complement to schema design will need to be here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Paging</em> for displaying large data sets and <em>plotting</em> for displaying data graphically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Responsive web design</em> because most a lot of people use their phones more than their laptops
    (particularly when they&rsquo;re in the field).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Accessibility</em> because I&rsquo;d be ashamed not to
    and because <a href="https://educate.elsevier.com/book/details/9780128044674">I&rsquo;m not getting any younger</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Security</em> is a hard one.
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">CORS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery">CSRF</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">SQL injection</a>, authentication, site certificates, and password management
    are all must-haves,
    but as <a href="https://exple.tive.org/blarg/">Mike Hoye</a> has observed,
    what we really need to teach people is things like,
    &ldquo;How to build websites that can&rsquo;t be exploited by abusive domestic partners.&rdquo;
    I really don&rsquo;t know what I could do here that wouldn&rsquo;t require a second book;
    I would try crowdsourcing it like <a href="https://aosabook.org/"><em>The Architecture of Open Source Applications</em></a>,
    but that didn&rsquo;t go anywhere <a href="../2024/01/23/the-votes-are-in/">the last time I tried it</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This book will probably never happen,
but probably isn&rsquo;t the same as definitely.
If you think of anything else that ought to be included,
please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">let me know</a>.</p>
<p>Later:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Irving Reid pointed out that running the application is as important as building it,
    and suggested the lessons should include creating and restoring backups,
    deploying updates,
    and observability
    (which involves more than creating log messages that are findable, comprehensible, and informative,
    but that would be a good start).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Someone else (name unknown) felt that dependency maintenance should be on the list as well,
    i.e.,
    that there should be a lesson about vulnerability scans and automating checks for dependency updates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Someone else (name also unknown) suggested that there ought to be a lesson on debugging full-stack applications,
    and that the lessons should show how to create good pull requests and how to review them.
    I strongly agree,
    but teaching verbs is a lot harder than teaching nouns,
    and this is already far too ambitious for something that would already take a year of unpaid work.</p>
</li>
</ul>

      Narconomics and Big Tech

  <p><time datetime="2024-06-14" class="post-date">2024-06-14</time></p>
  <p>I really enjoyed Wainwright&rsquo;s <em><a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/tom-wainwright/narconomics/9781610397704/">Narconomics</a></em>,
which explores the economics of the illegal drug trade.
It turns out that (for example) HR is more of a problem than you&rsquo;d think:
good accountants know they can actually make more money on Wall Street where crime is legal.
Marketing, dispute resolution, quality control: it&rsquo;s a very fun read.
But it sparked a thought:
I think a book comparing Big Tech to drug cartels would be awesome.
Both make money from selling addictive products and shrugging off externalities;
both needed new offerings to bring in new revenue (AI is to Google what meth was to the Juarez cartel);
both regard the legal system as merely an operating cost;
and both tend to be run by egomaniacal sociopaths.
(I expect Musk and Escobar would have gotten on well.)
If I knew enough, I&rsquo;d start writing today;
if you do, please start writing tomorrow.</p>
