      Things I'm Looking For
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2025-08-21" class="post-date">2025-08-21</time></p>
  <p>Following up on <a href="../2025/08/15/productivity-workshop-ideas/">my recent plea</a>
for material to use in a workshop on productivity for software engineers,
I&rsquo;d also be grateful for material on:</p>
<dl>
<dt>How to hand off or wind down a research project or open source software project.</dt>
<dd>For every beginning there must be an ending, but we don&rsquo;t like to talk about them.
For example, there are thousands of books in print about how to start a business,
but only a handful about how to pass one on or wind one down,
and many of those are really about how to sell out at the right time.
I think the reason is that mortality scares us,
but preparing for the end can make the end less likely,
and can help make what happens before then more enjoyable.
If you have ever shut something down or handed it over after several years,
please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">get in touch</a>.</dd>
<dt>A legal and business comparison of the new generation of software licenses.</dt>
<dd>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Source_License">Business Source License</a>
has attracted a lot of fire from open source zealots;
the <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/license">Unreal Engine license</a>
also puts restrictions on use,
but hasn&rsquo;t caused nearly as much yelling.
If anyone has written a level-headed compare-and-contrast of licenses
that the <a href="https://opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a> <em>hasn&rsquo;t</em> blessed,
but which give users more rights than a standard closed-source license,
I&rsquo;d be very grateful for a pointer—again,
please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">get in touch</a>.</dd>

      Productivity Workshop Ideas
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2025-08-15" class="post-date">2025-08-15</time></p>
  <p>Suppose you were going to build a one-day hands-on tutorial for software engineers
on what &ldquo;productivity&rdquo; means and how to observe it
(which might or might not include measuring it quantitatively).
You have 6x30 minutes to talk and 4x45 minutes for practical exercises.
(Yes, that&rsquo;s only six hours, but you need to leave time for questions, coffee breaks, lunch, etc.)
If each of those six slots is built around one particular research paper,
what are the papers?
And what are the four exercises?</p>
<p>Please:</p>
<ul>
<li>Peer-reviewed research papers please, not opinion pieces from industry pundits.</li>
<li>Papers, not books (but I&rsquo;ll accept chapters from books as &ldquo;papers&rdquo;).</li>
<li>Tools and data used in the exercises has to be openly accessible.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have suggestions, please [email me][email], and thank you in advance.
If there are enough useful comments, I&rsquo;ll organize an online discussion of this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why productivity?
Because it affords a good mix of &ldquo;how do we collect and analyze data?&rdquo;,
&ldquo;when are quantitative and qualitative analysis the right tools?&rdquo;,
and &ldquo;how do we operationalize a question like this?&rdquo;
It&rsquo;s also very topical—most discussions of the impact of AI are vacuous
because we&rsquo;re arguing about performance improvements without first defining
performance—and there&rsquo;s a lot of research out there to draw on.
I also hope it will draw interest from both the research community
and research-friendly practitioners.</p>

      This Week's Posts
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2025-08-13" class="post-date">2025-08-13</time></p>
  <p>(Including one from two weeks ago.)</p>
<h2>2025-07-30</h2>
<p>You know what would be a really thought-provoking team project for undergrad software engineering students?
Building a dashboard that measures and reports programmers&rsquo; productivity and identifies process bottlenecks.
Lots of coding,
lots of requirements gathering,
lots of UI design,
and <em>lots</em> of &ldquo;what the hell are we actually measuring and do we believe it&rsquo;s meaningful?&rdquo;
which would be the most illuminating part of the whole exercise for them.</p>
<h2>2025-08-09</h2>
<p><a href="../2012/01/21/the-life-i-did-live-the-breath-i-breathed/">My sister Sylvia</a>
died of pancreatic cancer in 2012 at the age of 47,
leaving three teenage children behind.
The mRNA cancer vaccine being developed in the US was the best hope we&rsquo;ve ever had to prevent this.
The Trump Administration&rsquo;s decision to cut funding for this live-saving research based on pseudo-scientific hysteria
condemns more people like my sister to death and more children to grow up without their mothers.</p>
<h2>2025-08-11</h2>
<p>There is a lot of ageism in tech.
One reason,
I think,
is that 30-year-olds spouting recycled Y Combinator bullshit
don&rsquo;t like having the obvious flaws and contradictions in their statements pointed out
by people who&rsquo;ve lived through two or three previous hype cycles.
Not hiring the elderly ensures that they&rsquo;re always in a high-adulation environment,
and never have to worry about whether staff will resist being guilted or bullied into sacrificing their personal lives
for someone else&rsquo;s gain.</p>
<h2>2025-08-12</h2>
<p><a href="https://andreas-zeller.info/">Andreas Zeller</a>&rsquo;s work is the most admirable example of software engineering research I know of.
Over several decades he and his team have done deep theoretical work <em>and</em> translated it into usable tools,
both to see if their ideas work in the real world and as a basis for dialog with developers about what problems to work on next.
(Go ahead, check out <em><a href="https://www.fuzzingbook.org/">The Fuzzing Book</a></em>
and <em><a href="https://www.debuggingbook.org/">The Debugging Book</a></em> —
you can thank me later.)</p>
<p>If I could go back 20 years and re-start my failed attempt to become a researcher myself,
I would try to do the same thing,
but would focus on developer productivity.
More specifically,
I would try to build deployable tools <em>that programmers would actually use</em>
to find bottlenecks in real-world development processes,
while simultaneously doing the theoretical work needed to figure out
&ldquo;what do we actually mean by &lsquo;productivity&rsquo; and how do we tell if someone&rsquo;s productive or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are lots of products in this space (Swarmia, Flow, etc.)
but I haven&rsquo;t seen something that is
(a) open source,
(b) straightforward to deploy,
(c) actively being improved,
and (d) backed up by the kind of research that <a href="https://www.drcathicks.com/">Cat Hicks</a>
and the contributors to <a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781484242209">this book</a> do.
I think that if we had something like this today,
a lot of the debate about whether AI makes programmers more productive would have a much higher signal-to-noise ratio.</p>
<h2>2025-08-12</h2>
<p>If you are using AI coding tools, please copy your prompt into the generated code as a comment (or have your agent do that):</p>
<ol>
<li>You wrote a precise requirement spec - why throw it away?</li>
<li>It&rsquo;ll help the next person understand the code.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s good context for the AI when you revise the code, too.</li>
<li>It will help researchers who want to study these tools&rsquo; accuracy and effectiveness.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a good way to label code as &ldquo;AI-generated&rdquo; or &ldquo;AI-assisted&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you.</p>

      Workshops I Want

  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2025-07-19" class="post-date">2025-07-19</time></p>
  <p>Following up on <a href="../2025/07/18/no-satisfaction/">yesterday&rsquo;s post</a>,
here are some workshops I&rsquo;d really like to take.
If you&rsquo;re offering any of them,
please let me know.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Experimental design and analysis for software engineers</strong>
    who are trying to figure out how well their AI-based tools actually work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>An introduction to the social sciences for programmers</strong>
    who want to understand how power actually works in our society.
    (See <a href="../talks/sdgc/"><em>Sex and Drugs and Guns and Code</em></a> for some thoughts.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Distributed systems design by example</strong>—basically,
    a sequel to <a href="../sdxpy/"><em>Software Design by Example</em></a>
    in which learners build working models of distributed systems
    in order to understand how the real things work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Systems administration for data scientists</strong>
    (or, what people who wrangle dataframes for a living need to know
    in order to deploy an application for others to use).
    This request is mostly professional curiosity:
    I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://gvwilson.github.io/sudonomicon/">tried and failed</a> to create this,
    and would like to see how others do it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Managing research software projects</strong>—not &ldquo;how to use Git&rdquo;
    but hiring and firing,
    marketing,
    budgeting,
    succession planning,
    and similar challenges.
    Again,
    I&rsquo;ve also <a href="../mrsp/">tried and failed to create this</a>,
    so my interest here is partly professional curiosity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Organizational change for research software engineers</strong>.
    We spend a lot of our time rolling rocks up hills;
    as I approach the end of my career,
    I&rsquo;d really like someone to teach me how to get rid of the damn hills.
    <em>Note: we&rsquo;re <a href="https://gvwilson.github.io/change/">working on this one</a>;
    please reach out if you&rsquo;d like to help.</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>In a better world than this,
Canada would have a Natural Science and Engineering Education Council alongside NSERC
to fund the creation, dissemination, delivery, and evaluation of teaching and training materials.
Alas, that is not the timeline we&rsquo;re in…</em></p>

  <p>I don&rsquo;t actually get much satisfaction from saying &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;
because I only do it when the bad thing I was worried about has happened.
What motivates this observation is
the recent <a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/">METR paper</a>
claiming that using AI lowers developers&rsquo; productivity.
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grimalkina.bsky.social/post/3ltpo634qc22l">Cat Hicks</a> and others
have done a better job of explaining the flaws in METR&rsquo;s methodology than I possibly could.
What I want now is a workshop that teaches programmers
how to do trustworthy experiments on LLMs
and spot the mistakes in others&rsquo; studies.</p>
<p>Thousands and thousands of developers are trying to benchmark bots,
figure out if spicy autocomplete is making them more productive,
et endless cetera.
Most of those efforts are methodological and statistical dumpster fires;
while I don&rsquo;t want to be cynical,
I think the same programmers who ignored <a href="https://neverworkintheory.org/">It Will Never Work in Theory</a>
might pay attention to something with &ldquo;AI&rdquo; in its title.
Please,
someone,
save us from ourselves…</p>

  <p>I&rsquo;m finally turning <a href="../ideas/sdgc/">my proposal</a> for a book titled
<em>Sex and Drugs and Guns and Code: What Everyone in Tech Needs to Know About Politics, Economics, Justice, and Power</em>
into a talk.
The sources I plan to mention are listed below;
I&rsquo;d be grateful for pointers to ones I&rsquo;ve missed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: my target audience is undergraduates in computer science and software engineering
who have never taken a class on politics, sociology, anthropology, or organizational behavior,
but dismiss those disciplines as &ldquo;soft&rdquo;.
If forced to wade through something dense and dull
they will dutifully parrot what they think they&rsquo;re supposed to in order to get a grade,
but not change their view of the world in any substantial way.
In order to have impact,
this book must be engaging;
serious academics may therefore dismiss it as &ldquo;light&rdquo; or &ldquo;shallow&rdquo;,
but there&rsquo;s no point being right if no one hears you.</p>
</blockquote>

<li>Levitt &amp; Dubner: <em><a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780061234002">Freakonomics</a></em> (2006)<ul>
<li>Preaches the neoliberal gospel that the only valid way to analyze individual behavior is maximization of wealth…</li>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Most young programmers have only ever been exposed to one worldview:
the toxic strain of neoliberal capitalism favored by venture capitalists and their gushing fans in the tech media.
As inequality widens and racist nationalism makes a comeback,
as we do everything in our power to make climate change <em>worse</em>
while companies like X, Facebook, and Shopify tie themselves in knots to avoid responsibility for their actions,
most programmers don&rsquo;t have the intellectual tools to understand what&rsquo;s wrong and how we might fix it.</p>
<p>Lots of books give cogent answers to these questions,
but programmers who have never done a civics course
are not going to read nine thousand pages on a whim.
However,
they <em>might</em> sit through a one-semester course that explains why the human side of software engineering
is harder than the technical side.
This talk outlines what such a course might cover:
why &ldquo;flat&rdquo; organizations make power imbalances worse rather than better,
why discrimination persists despite its economic inefficiency,
how regulatory capture works,
why Americans keep shooting one another,
and what can we learn about big tech by studying drug cartels.</p>

      Some Testing Answers
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2025-05-19" class="post-date">2025-05-19</time></p>
  <p>A month ago I <a href="../2025/04/20/a-testing-question/">asked for advice</a> on testing a little piece of Python
that fills a grid using a random walk.
<a href="https://stochasticsolutions.com/">Nick Radcliffe</a>,
a former colleague who is writing a book on test-driven data analysis,
suggested that one way to test the code is to put move generation in a function of its own,
call that function a few hundred times,
and check that the results are evenly distributed
(e.g., each of the four moves appears 20-30% of the time).
If not,
double the number of moves generated,
check again,
and repeat until either the distribution converges
or you decide that it&rsquo;s not going to.
This approach ensures that tests run quickly most of the time,
and it did indeed catch a bug when I moved from 4-way steps to 8-way (i.e., allowed diagonal moves).</p>
<p><a href="https://nathanfurnal.xyz/">Nathan Furnal</a> suggested a similar approach.
If we generate 30 moves,
the probability of never seeing one of the four possible moves is less than 0.02%.
If we increase the number of moves to 100 (which only takes 61 microseconds on my five-year-old laptop)
the odds of not seeing one of the moves drop to one in 10<sup>13</sup>.
If we&rsquo;re running the tests 1000 times a day,
we can expect one false positive every ten million years or so.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve added both tests to my test suite,
but would appreciate suggestions for others.
Testing in the face of randomness is more common and more important in (data) science
than in commercial software development;
as more and more applications incorporate small household spirits (i.e., genAI),
we&rsquo;re going to have to figure out how to do this well.</p>

    <a href="../2025/05/18/two-thirds-of-a-language/">
      Two Thirds of a Language
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p><time datetime="2025-05-18" class="post-date">2025-05-18</time></p>
  <p>Inspired in part by posts online about this year&rsquo;s PyCon,
I started to wonder how much of the language I actually use.
To answer the question,
I counted how many different types of nodes are provided by <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html">Python&rsquo;s <code>ast</code> module</a>
and how many of those show up in the code I wrote for
<a href="../sdxpy/"><em>Software Design by Example</em></a>.
The answer appears to be 60%,
i.e.,
I use a bit less than two-thirds of what Python 3.12 offers.
Other measures would give other answers—for example,
I expect that I use much, much less than 60% of Python&rsquo;s standard library—but still,
it&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>I hope everyone&rsquo;s having fun in Pittsburgh…</p>
