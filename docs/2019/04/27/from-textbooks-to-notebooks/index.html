<!-- content --><p>I just converted my introduction to R for Python programmers from Jekyll to <a href="https://bookdown.org/">bookdown</a>,
partly because I wanted to learn how bookdown works
but also because I think that computational notebooks are one of the futures of programming.
(We&rsquo;re a pretty big field, so I think we&rsquo;re going to have more than one.)</p>
<p>My question is, what kind of notebook would be best suited to teaching?
I think we can answer that by looking at how existing textbooks present code,
at what else they present,
and at what else people use when teaching.
Here are a few things I&rsquo;ve done that I can&rsquo;t easily do with either R Markdown or Jupyter Notebooks:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Placeholders.</em>
    I often want to present the skeleton of a class with <code>…</code> markers for methods,
    then present those methods one by one with discussion interleaved.
    Knuth&rsquo;s original vision of literate programming supported this,
    but today&rsquo;s notebooks don&rsquo;t.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Incremental development.</em>
    So far as I know,
    I can&rsquo;t split the body of a single function across multiple code blocks in existing notebooks,
    but when I present code in something like <em><a href="../../../../js4ds/">JavaScript versus Data Science</a></em>
    I often want to write a few lines of a function,
    explain what&rsquo;s going on,
    then write the next few lines and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Diagrams</em>.
    Yeah, I know, I can draw something with an external tool,
    save the file,
    then link to that file in my notebook,
    but seriously:
    how long are we going to communicating with our multimedia supercomputers via punch cards?
    Good teaching materials use a wide variety of graphics,
    everyone else&rsquo;s tools allow drawings to be created and previewed in situ—let&rsquo;s have some of that in our notebooks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Highlighting</em>.
    I can highlight <span style="background-color: #ffff33">this text</span> with three clicks in a WYSIWYG editor,
    or with 46 keystrokes in HTML.
    Highlighting a section of code in a notebook that I also want to run is painful;
    circling parts of the program and adding callouts <em>while leaving it runnable</em> is even worse,
    but these are things that good textbooks frequently do.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not asking for these features—not yet.
What I want now is for some enterprising graduate student to go through
a couple of  dozen highly-rated programming textbooks
and compile a list of how frequently different kinds of things are used.
This was part of what led me to <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0218/">propose</a> that sets be added to Python:
I noticed that they were used over and over again in algorithms books
but weren&rsquo;t a first-class citizen of any major programming language.
Such a list could also help us compare notebooks and steer their future development.
If you&rsquo;re interested in taking this on,
please give me a shout—I&rsquo;d welcome a chance to talk.</p>
<p><em>By the way,
I think we ought to start calling computational notebooks &ldquo;knuths&rdquo;
in honor of the inventor of literate programming.
If anyone in our field deserves to have their name become a common noun,
I think he does.</em></p><!-- /content -->
