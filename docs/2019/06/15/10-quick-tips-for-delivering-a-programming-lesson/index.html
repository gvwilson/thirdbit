<p>Designing a great lesson is the first 90% of effective teaching;
delivering it well is the other 90%. The 10 simple rules outlined in
this paper describe classroom practices that instructors can adopt
immediately and at low cost.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Teaching is a craft, and like any craft it can be improved by studying,
adopting, and adapting the practices of others. This paper describes ten
practices that can be applied to a wide variety of subjects and have
proven their value in both regular classrooms and free-range workshops.
They are easier to adopt than those described in [<a href="#Brow2018">Brow2018</a>; <a href="#Deve2018">Deve2018</a>],
some of which are briefly discussed in the conclusion; some have been
inspired by [<a href="#Hust2012">Hust2012</a>; <a href="#Lang2016">Lang2016</a>; <a href="#Lemo2014">Lemo2014</a>], while others are drawn
from the author&rsquo;s experience teaching programming to researchers
[<a href="#Wils2016">Wils2016</a>].</p>
<h2>1. Use formative assessment every 5&ndash;15 minutes.</h2>
<p>As instructors, we always want to get through material than time allows,
so we often teach at the speed at which we can talk rather than the
speed at which people can learn. Having learners do something every
5&ndash;15 slows us down, keeps them engaged, and gives us and them feedback
on whether they have actually understood what has just been taught.</p>
<p>In-class checks like this are one kind are called <em>formative
assessments</em>. Good ones take only a minute or two to complete so that
they don&rsquo;t derail the flow of the lesson, and have an unambiguous
correct answer so that they can be checked in large classes. Popular
kinds of formative assessment in programming classes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Answer a multiple choice question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write a few lines of code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Predict what the code on the screen will do when it runs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contribute the next line of code.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Starting with a formative assessment that reviews a previous lesson is a
good way to signal that class has started, and having students recall
older material before tackling something new has been shown to improve
learning outcomes [<a href="#Wein2018b">Wein2018b</a>]. Similarly, ending the class with such an
exercise gives learners a sense of how far they (should have)
progressed.</p>
<p>A complement to this rule is to get students out of their seats every
45&ndash;60 minutes. People&rsquo;s brains get tired when they are concentrating,
and tired brains can&rsquo;t learn [<a href="#Ambr2010">Ambr2010</a>; <a href="#HPL2">HPL2</a>]. Caffeine doesn&rsquo;t fix
this, so have your learners get up and move around for a few minutes
every hour in order to reoxygenate their gray cells. This allows those
who need a bathroom break to take care of things discreetly<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>, and
give the instructor a few moments to answer questions and figure out
what to teach next.</p>
<h2>2. Monitor progress and learners&rsquo; need for assistance.</h2>
<p>Sticky notes are one of my favorite teaching tools, and I&rsquo;m not alone in
loving their versatility, portability, stickability, foldability, and
subtle yet alluring aroma [<a href="#Ward2015">Ward2015</a>]. Give each student two sticky
notes of different colors, such as orange and green. If someone has
completed an exercise and wants it checked, or if they feel that they
are following the lesson, they put the green sticky note somewhere the
teacher can see. If they run into a problem and need help, they put up
the orange one. This works much better than having people raise their
hands: it&rsquo;s more discreet (which means they&rsquo;re more likely to actually
do it), they can keep working while their flag is raised rather than
trying to type one-handed, and the teacher can quickly see from the
front of the room what state the class is in.</p>
<h2>3. Use a visibly fair mechanism to distribute your attention evenly.</h2>
<p>Teachers naturally focus their attention on learners who are making eye
contact and asking lots of questions—in other words, on extroverts.
This creates two feedback loops: the extroverts ask even more questions
because they&rsquo;re getting attention, while other students stop trying to
engage because they&rsquo;re not. To ensure the teacher&rsquo;s attention is fairly
distributed, have each learner write their name on a sticky note and
post it somewhere visible. Each time the teacher calls on them or
answers one of their questions, they take their sticky note down. Once
all the sticky notes are down, everyone puts theirs up again. This
technique makes it easy for the teacher to see who they haven&rsquo;t spoken
with recently, which helps them avoid unconscious bias and preferential
interaction. It also shows learners how attention is being distributed
so that when they <em>are</em> called on, they won&rsquo;t feel like they&rsquo;re being
picked on.</p>
<h2>4. Make mistakes and work through them.</h2>
<p>Novices spend most of their time trying to figure out what&rsquo;s broken and
how to fix it, but teachers rarely devote that proportion of lessons to
analyzing and correcting errors. Watching you figure out that something
is wrong, hearing you work backward through the error messages to
possible causes, and seeing you make and test fixes is often one of the
most valuable things you can show your learners.</p>
<p>For example, an effective way to teach programming is <em>live coding</em>.
Instead of presenting pre-written material, teachers write code in front
of their class as their learners follow along. Doing this provides lots
of opportunities for making and correcting mistakes, and watching a
program being written is more engaging than watching someone page
through slides. It also slows the teacher down, and helps remind them
just how much they are throwing at their learners. Finally, watching
teachers make mistakes shows learners that it&rsquo;s all right to make
mistakes of their own. If the teacher isn&rsquo;t embarrassed about making and
talking about mistakes, learners will be more comfortable doing so too.</p>
<h2>5. Follow your learners—twice.</h2>
<p>A slide deck is like taking a journey by train: the ride may be smooth,
but the route can&rsquo;t be changed on the fly. Live coding, on the other
hand, is like going off road in a four-wheel drive: it may be bumpier
and messier, but it&rsquo;s a lot easier to explore things that catch your
attention. In particular, if a student asks a &ldquo;what if&rdquo; question, it&rsquo;s a
lot easier to respond if you are writing code or proving a theorem in
real time than if you are using a slide deck. Following your learners&rsquo;
lead also signals that you respect their time and interests; this
improves engagement, which in turn improves learning outcomes
[<a href="#Wlod2017">Wlod2017</a>].</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s possible to have too much of a good thing. If someone asks a
question, try it out. If they or someone else asks a follow-up, try that
too, but then come back to your main point. Otherwise, you can easily
find yourself pulled so far off course that you don&rsquo;t reach the most
important points of your lesson.</p>
<h2>6. Create a backlog.</h2>
<p>You may not have time to answer all of your students&rsquo; questions, or
might not actually know the answers. To handle this, write questions on
sticky notes and post them on the wall behind you, then look over this
backlog during breaks and decide which questions you want to tackle.
This gives you a chance to prioritize based on what&rsquo;s most relevant (and
what you actually know). It also helps build trust: many people have
learned that &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll address that later&rdquo; means &ldquo;I hope you forget that you
asked&rdquo;, so if they see you trying to tackle a few of the questions that
have come up, they will forgive you for not getting to the rest.</p>
<h2>7. Have learners work in pairs.</h2>
<p>A sense of community is one of the primary motivators for adult learning
[<a href="#Wlod2017">Wlod2017</a>], so encourage your learners to talk to teach as they work
through exercises. Peer instruction puts group discussion at the center
of teaching [<a href="#Crou2001">Crou2001</a>; <a href="#Smit2009">Smit2009</a>; <a href="#Port2016">Port2016</a>], but <em>pair programming</em>
and similar practices are also effective.</p>
<p>Pair programming is a software development practice in which one person
(the driver) does the typing while the other (the navigator) offers
comments and suggestions, and the two switch roles several times per
hour. It is effective in professional work [<a href="#Hann2009">Hann2009</a>], and benefits in
teaching include increased success rate in introductory courses, better
software, and higher student confidence in their solutions. There is
also evidence that students from underrepresented groups benefit even
more than others [<a href="#McDo2006">McDo2006</a>; <a href="#Hank2011">Hank2011</a>; <a href="#Cele2018">Cele2018</a>]. I have found it
particularly helpful with mixed-ability classes, since pairs are more
homogeneous than individuals. When you use pairing, put everyone in
pairs, not just learners who are struggling, so that no one feels
singled out.</p>
<h2>8. Present diagrams incrementally.</h2>
<p>Our brains have separate channels for processing visual and linguistic
information [<a href="#Ambr2010">Ambr2010</a>; <a href="#HPL2">HPL2</a>], so people learn best when complementary
material is presented simultaneously through these channels. In simple
terms, that means your slides should present diagrams or other relevant
images for you to talk about, and that these diagrams should be built up
piece by piece rather than presented all at once. When the diagram is
presented piece by piece, students&rsquo; brains will correlate the arrival of
new visual information with the arrival of new linguistic information
[<a href="#Maye2003">Maye2003</a>; <a href="#Maye2009">Maye2009</a>]. Presentation of either later on will then help
trigger recall of the other.</p>
<h2>9. Have learners take notes, and review them.</h2>
<p>Taking notes forces students to organize and reflect on information as
it&rsquo;s coming in, which in turn increases the likelihood that you will
transfer it to long-term memory. Many studies have shown that
note-taking improves retention [<a href="#Aike1975">Aike1975</a>; <a href="#Boha2011">Boha2011</a>].</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, when being able to accurately record information or the
minutes of a meeting was considered an essential white-collar skill, it
was common for high school teachers to require students to submit their
notes for grading. This is less common today, but is still beneficial,
since it gives the teacher an opportunity to identify gaps between what
they thought they taught and what their students heard.</p>
<p>If the resources to do this are not available, have learners take a
minute at the end of each class to write one thing they learned on one
side of a card and one question they still have or something they&rsquo;re
confused about on the other. Review these <em>minute cards</em> and looking for
patterns only takes a few minutes, and tells you what you need to
clarify at the start of the next lesson.</p>
<h2>10. Teach together when you can.</h2>
<p><em>Co-teaching</em> describes any situation in which two teachers work
together in the same classroom. [<a href="#Frie2016">Frie2016</a>] describes several ways to do
this:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Team teaching</strong></dt>
<dd>Both teachers deliver a single stream of content in tandem, taking
turns like musicians taking solos.</dd>
<dt><strong>Teach and assist</strong></dt>
<dd>Teacher A teaches while Teacher B moves around the classroom to help
struggling students.</dd>
<dt><strong>Alternative teaching</strong></dt>
<dd>Teacher A provides a small set of students with more intensive or
specialized instruction while Teacher B delivers a general lesson to
the main group.</dd>
<dt><strong>Teach and observe</strong></dt>
<dd>Teacher A teaches while Teacher B observes the students, collecting
data on their understanding to help plan future lessons.</dd>
<dt><strong>Parallel teaching</strong></dt>
<dd>The class is divided in two and the teachers present the same
material simultaneously to each.</dd>
<dt><strong>Station teaching</strong></dt>
<dd>The students are divided into small groups that rotate from one
station or activity to the next while teachers supervise where
needed.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Team teaching is particularly beneficial in day-long workshops: it give
each teacher a chance to rest and think about what they are going to do
next. If you and a partner are co-teaching:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Take 2&ndash;3 minutes before the start of each class to confirm who&rsquo;s
    teaching what.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work out a couple of hand signals as well. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going too fast,&rdquo;
    &ldquo;speak up,&rdquo; &ldquo;that learner needs help,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for a
    bathroom break&rdquo; are all useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each person should teach for at least 10&ndash;15 minutes at a stretch,
    since students will be distracted by more frequent switch-ups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The person who isn&rsquo;t teaching shouldn&rsquo;t interrupt, offer corrections
    or elaborations, or do anything else to distract from what the
    person teaching is doing or saying, but may ask leading questions if
    the learners seem lethargic or unsure of themselves.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, take a few minutes when the class is over to
congratulate or commiserate with each other: in teaching as in life,
shared misery is lessened and shared joy increased.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you are teaching an evening class after working for a full day, you
and your learners will both appreciate it if you brush your teeth and
put on a clean shirt. Cough drops will help you keep your voice and fend
off whatever colds the learners brought with them, and your back will be
grateful tomorrow that you wore comfortable shoes today.</p>
