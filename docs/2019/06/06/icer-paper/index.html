<!-- content --><p>Paul Denny, Brett Becker, Michelle Craig, Piotr Banaszkiewicz, and I
were very pleased to receive notice last week
that <a href="https://icer.acm.org/">ICER 2019</a>
has accepted our paper exploring
the questions people would most like computing education researchers to answer.
To recap:</p>
<ol>
<li>We asked one group of people what questions they would most like answered, then</li>
<li>grouped and collated those questions, and</li>
<li>asked a larger group of people how important or unimportant they thought those questions were.</li>
</ol>
<p>We also asked respondents about their backgrounds and whether they teach and/or do research.
The most surprising finding was how little overlap there was between
the interests of people who do research and the interests of people who don&rsquo;t:</p>
<table class="centered">
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Most Interesting to Researchers</th>
    <th>Most Interesting to Non-Researchers</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1.</td>
    <td>What fundamental programming concepts are the most challenging for students?</td>
    <td>How and when is it best to give students feedback on their code to improve learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2.</td>
    <td>What teaching strategies are most effective when dealing with a wide range of prior experience in introductory programming classes?</td>
    <td>What kinds of programming exercises are most effective when teaching students Computer Science?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3.</td>
    <td>What affects students' ability to generalize from simple programming examples?</td>
    <td>What are the relative merits of project-based learning, lecturing, and active learning for students learning computing?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4.</td>
    <td>What teaching practices are most effective for teaching computing to children?</td>
    <td>What is the most effective way to provide feedback to students in programming classes?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5.</td>
    <td>What kinds of problems do students in programming classes find most engaging?    </td>
    <td>What do people find most difficult when breaking problems down into smaller tasks while programming?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6.</td>
    <td>What are the most effective ways to teach programming to various groups?</td>
    <td>What are the key concepts that students need to understand in introductory computing classes?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7.</td>
    <td>What are the most effective ways to scale computing education to reach the general student population?</td>
    <td>What are the most effective ways to develop computing competency among students in non-computing disciplines?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>8.</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>What is the best order in which to teach basic computing concepts and skills?</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>(The imbalance in numbers is an artefact of how we did the analysis.)
We will post a preprint as soon as we&rsquo;ve addressed the reviewers&rsquo; comments;
if you are coming to Toronto for the conference,
please give me a shoutâ€”I&rsquo;d be happy to show you around my adopted home town.</p><!-- /content -->
