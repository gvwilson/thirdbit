<!-- content --><p>I talk a lot about lesson design and delivery,
but when instructors get a chance to ask me something one-to-one,
what they often ask is, &ldquo;How much should I charge?&rdquo;
The short answer is that it depends on where you are and who your audience is;
the longer answer is that you can figure out low and high bounds
by looking at what you pay and doing a little math.</p>
<p><em>What follows is personal opinions based on work I have done as an independent consultant and trainer.
It does not necessarily reflect the views of my employers.</em></p>
<p>For example,
you might pay $350 for a full-day workshop at an academic conference.
If there are 30 attendees,
that&rsquo;s a gross revenue of $10.5K;
the venue is probably getting $1.5K for the room,
so even if we double that to include coffee and the union electrician on standby,
you and the organizers have $7.5K to split.
Now,
that money might be underwriting the conference,
so you might only get travel, accommodation, and free registration,
but if the hosts are taking anything home,
you should too
and it&rsquo;s perfectly reasonable to ask.</p>
<p>At the other end,
a two-day workshop at a medical or financial conference
is probably going to cost attendees $2K each
(or rather, cost their employers,
since they&rsquo;re almost certainly <em>not</em> paying out of pocket).
If there are 30 attendees once again,
that&rsquo;s a gross of $60K;
figure $3K/day for a nicer room
and $100/day per attendee for food and drink
(yes, venues charge like fairgrounds and movie theaters)
and there&rsquo;s $48K on the table.
A 50/50 split with the organizers gives you $24K for two days of teaching,
which compares favorably with what adjunct (sessional) teachers make at some schools in a year.</p>
<p>Of course,
this doesn&rsquo;t take lesson development time into account.
I budget a full day of work for an hour of lesson material
<em>if I already know the subject reasonably well</em>.
For the one-day academic scenario outlined above,
that means I earn (roughly) $3000 for 7 days of prep plus 1 day of teaching,
which is very roughly $50/hr.
(By comparison,
my guitar teacher charges $75 for a one-hour lesson.)
For the two-day commercial scenario,
the all-in rate is about $160/hr,
which is $10/hr more than I used to charge for contract software development.</p>
<p>What about amortization?
If I teach the same workshop several times without modification
then my effective hourly rate goes up,
but &ldquo;without modification&rdquo; is a mythical beast you can chase but will never catch.
Technology changes,
your audience changes,
you learn something about your material each time you teach:
unless your material has been refined dozens of times
(like the <a href="https://carpentries.org/workshops-curricula/">Carpentries lessons</a>),
you should figure each offering requires 1-3 hours of prep for each hour of teaching.</p>
<p>These numbers are all based on my own experience
as a white guy working in affluent parts of the world
during a succession of tech bubbles.
I don&rsquo;t know how to rescale any of these factors for other circumstances;
what I do know is that sharing data like this helps newcomers negotiate,
just as sharing salary figures helps people make sure they&rsquo;re not being taken advantage of.
I&rsquo;d be grateful for any additions or corrections anyone would care to offer.</p><!-- /content -->
