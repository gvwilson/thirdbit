<!-- content --><p>I&rsquo;ve been working on a new Jekyll template for lessons
that can also be used to produce nicely-formatted PDFs,
mostly to give myself an excuse to do a little programming every once in a while.
I wanted to do the whole thing in pure GitHub Pages-compatible Jekyll without any plugins or compilation,
but section references defeated me,
so authors still have to run a little script to regenerate a table of contents and commit it.</p>
<p>What I noticed while building this template is I&rsquo;m still very much a static programmer.
Thirty-nine years after I started writing Pascal,
I still think in terms of compiling things to completion before letting anyone see any results.
For example,
I started writing a script to find cross-references in the pages generated by Jekyll
and fix them up
so that I could commit the post-processed HTML to Git;
I really had to struggle to give myself permission to write a few lines of JavaScript
to do this in the pages as they were loaded
(which is simpler in several ways).
Similarly,
I wrote a short Python script to tidy up the LaTeX that Pandoc generates from that HTML.
It originally contained a list of transformation functions;
I knew that I could look them up dynamically,
but my early-80s instincts kept telling me, &ldquo;Nope, that&rsquo;s too clever, something will go wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paradoxically,
I trend the other way when teaching.
Toby Hodges and I have put together
<a href="../../../../js4ds/">a tutorial on JavaScript for data scientists</a>,
but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever teach it exactly as written.
I always improvise based on who&rsquo;s in my audience and whatever bright ideas I had in the shower that morning.
It makes co-instruction harder,
but if I&rsquo;m teaching on my own,
I find it more effective and more fun.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s the difference.
Dynamic function lookup can be elegant,
but it imposes a higher cognitive load on someone who&rsquo;s trying to figure out
exactly what&rsquo;s going to happen in what order,
because that order is implied by control structure rather than written out explicitly.
Maybe I prefer static code over dynamic code because the former is easier for the next person to understand,
and I&rsquo;m always coding with the next person in mind.
Maybe I like dynamic teaching because I still think of it as a solo activity.</p><!-- /content -->
