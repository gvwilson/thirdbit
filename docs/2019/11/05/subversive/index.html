<!-- content --><p>My dad told me once that Hitler feared Charlie Chaplin more than Winston Churchill,
because people will rally around a leader who is faced with an enemy,
but lose their fear of one who has been made to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Dictator">look ridiculous</a>.
I&rsquo;ve repeated that many times,
but I&rsquo;m damned if I can find a credible source.</p>
<p>Similarly,
for years I have quoted Orwell saying that
Rudyard Kipling was the best bad writer English ever produced.
Turns out it wasn&rsquo;t Orwell (though <a href="http://orwell.ru/library/reviews/kipling/english/e_rkip">his piece on Kipling</a> is still a joy to read),
but whoever said it was right:
Kipling&rsquo;s racism and jingoism were embarrassing even in his own later years,
but <em>Kim</em> and <em>The Jungle Book</em> and <em>The Man Who Would Be King</em>
are still just so much fun to read.</p>
<p>Which brings us to recent comments by Very Important Directors about Marvel&rsquo;s superhero movies.
These VIDs have made great art,
but like most powerful people,
their power has made them deeply suspicious of anything that is merely fun.
Power doesn&rsquo;t trust Fun
because it never knows what Fun is going to do.
Power is always a little bit worried that Fun is going to make fun of <em>it</em>,
or come up with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Into_the_Spider-Verse">something so wonderful</a> that people might stop paying attention to Power
(if only for a while).
Power has to look down on Fun
because it can&rsquo;t be sure that Fun will look up to Power like it&rsquo;s bloody well supposed to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not religious,
but I&rsquo;ve read a few things over the years,
and to the best of my knowledge,
no faith&rsquo;s scriptures contain a joke that bears re-telling.
People tell me there&rsquo;s joy in heaven,
but is there laughter?
Are there jokes that stay funny forever,
and if so,
are any of them at Her expense?
I kind of hope so,
because if there is an afterlife,
I&rsquo;ll be disappointed if Fun&rsquo;s not there.</p><!-- /content -->
