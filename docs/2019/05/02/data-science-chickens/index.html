<!-- content --><p>The biggest problem in data science is its bias against people who aren&rsquo;t straight, affluent, white or Asian males.
Its second biggest problem, in my opinion, is that nobody talks about how they sex chickens.
After a long period of trial and error,
people can learn <a href="https://psmag.com/magazine/the-lucrative-art-of-chicken-sexing">how to tell at a glance whether a newborn chick is male or female</a>.
The problem is, most of them don&rsquo;t know how they know:
they&rsquo;ve trained the neural network between their ears,
but they don&rsquo;t have conscious access to their decision criteria.</p>
<p>Data scientists do something similar every day:
they decide that a result seems right enough for them to move on to the next problem.
In my experience,
only a handful make this decision consciously
or have explicit criteria (e.g., unit tests that pass).
Most just look at a result and think, &ldquo;Good—now what&rsquo;s next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I really want to know what their heuristics are.
I really want to know how consistent they are from one data scientist to the next,
because I suspect that there&rsquo;s much more variation than we realize.
(As the joke goes,
physicists worry about decimal points,
astronomers worry about exponents,
and economists are happy if they&rsquo;ve got the sign right.)
Mostly,
though,
I want to know so that I know what to teach.
It&rsquo;s easy to show people how to use a unit test framework,
but I predict that there&rsquo;s an inverse correlation between how easy tests are to write with the tools we have today
and the things that influence human judgment about whether answers are right enough.</p>
<p>One way to elicit understanding would be to have a couple of dozen data scientists think aloud
while working through a series of problems and trying to decide if there&rsquo;s a bug or not.
I&rsquo;m sure there are other ways as well;
I&rsquo;d be grateful for suggestions.</p>
<p><em>Note: in response to a question on an early draft of this post,
I&rsquo;m not necessarily talking about statistical significance when I talk about correctness.
Years ago I helped analyze a study of the spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis in Ontario hospitals.
Thanks to a bit of sloppy SQL,
I accidentally dropped all the records for everyone who didn&rsquo;t have a home address.
It turns out that if you don&rsquo;t include homeless people in a study like this it affects the answer…
Someone else caught the mistake less than an hour before we were going to submit the paper,
but I still wonder how many other non-obvious mistakes I&rsquo;ve published.
The code didn&rsquo;t crash,
the graphs weren&rsquo;t flat—nothing smelled off to me.
I&rsquo;m now a bit obsessive about checking for NULLs,
but I still managed to create a histogram recently in which all zero scores had silently been dropped.
Would a real data scientist have spotted that before sharing it with others?
If so, what would have run their alarm bells?</em></p><!-- /content -->
