<!-- content --><p>I woke up this morning to the sound of wind chimes in the rain.
It isn&rsquo;t fall yet,
but it&rsquo;s definitely no longer summer:
not cold,
not even cool,
but both are on their way.
The chimes hang from a beam above our new back deck;
they were my father&rsquo;s,
and the combination of their tenor &ldquo;bong&rdquo; and the patter of raindrops
takes me back to the house I grew up on Vancouver Island.
It&rsquo;s a peaceful sound, but melancholy,
and it makes me think about what we&rsquo;ve had and what we&rsquo;ve lost.</p>
<p>My father grew up in a small farming town in Australia.
His earliest memory was sneaking down to the beach with his brother
and watching the adults collect body parts that had washed ashore
from a hospital ship that had been torpedoed.
Education was his salvation,
and I remember him saying after the wall came down in &lsquo;89
that maybe—just maybe—we were going to make it.</p>
<p>Next week will be the fourth anniversary of his death.
I miss him,
but I&rsquo;m glad that he didn&rsquo;t live to see us throw away so much of what his generation worked so hard to build.
Health care that might have saved my grandmother&rsquo;s life,
pensions that you could actually live on,
laws to stop people from acting on the worst of their bigotry:
none of it was perfect,
or even finished,
but he had lived long enough to see a black man elected president
and the air and water were cleaner than they had been in a hundred years and—</p>
<p>And then my generation said, &ldquo;Nope, don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;
We shrugged as billionaires spread misinformation and rigged laws to make themselves even richer
and pretended we were helpless while tech bros monetized hate on a global scale
and now those vultures have all come home to roost
and we choose to forget that better is possible if you&rsquo;re willing to fight for it.</p>
<p>In 1992,
just before I left Edinburgh,
I saw John Galbraith speak.
When someone in the audience asked him afterward what had surprised him most during his long and busy life,
he didn&rsquo;t hesitate:
&ldquo;I would never have believed that stupid could become fashionable.&rdquo;
Hearing the chimes this morning,
I remembered my dad chuckling when I told him that story.
Listening to the rain,
I can only hope that my daughter will forgive us.</p><!-- /content -->
