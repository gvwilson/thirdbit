<!-- content --><p>A year ago,
I wrote <a href="../../../../2018/04/12/notional-machine-for-python/">a description of a notional machine for Python</a>,
i.e.,
the mental model of how Python programs execute that I want to convey to learners when I&rsquo;m teaching.
I didn&rsquo;t get much feedback on it at the time,
so I still don&rsquo;t know how well it corresponds to other people&rsquo;s notional machines,
but it was apparently mentioned in
<a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/de/programm/kalender/semhp/?semnr=19281">a recent workshop on notional machines</a>,
so I thought it might be worth following up by describing my notional machine for
the tidyverse in R
(the programming framework I&rsquo;ve learned most recently).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When code is loaded,
   R converts it to a sequence of instructions
   that are stored in memory just like any other data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When code is executed,
   R steps through the instructions,
   doing what each tells it to in turn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A program manipulates three basic types of data:
   numbers, text, and Booleans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A program stores data in vectors,
   each of which contains zero or more values of the same type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vectors may contain the special values <code>NA</code> (for missing data)
   and <code>NaN</code> (for illegal numbers, like the result of dividing by zero).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basic operations like addition work on corresponding elements of vectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A scalar like <code>3.14</code> or <code>"hello"</code> is just a vector of length 1.
   Its value is repeated as necessary when it&rsquo;s combined with a longer vector
   (which is why <code>1 + X</code> works).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vectors are usually not used on their own.
   Instead, they are combined into tables,
   each of which is a list of named vectors of the same length (but possibly different types).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We think of the columns (vectors) in a table as statistical variables,
   and the rows (corresponding elements) as observations of those variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vectors are not modified after they are created.
   Instead,
   a program calculates new vectors and adds them to existing tables,
   or uses them to create entirely new tables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A program can do different calculations depending on the values in vectors,
   or keep only a subset of results to produce a vector of a different length than the original.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We make programs easier to understand by writing functions,
   which are recipes that give a name to a series of calculations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a function is called,
   a new stack frame is pushed on the call stack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a variable is used,
   R looks for it in the top stack frame.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the function completes or returns,
   R switches from its blob of instructions
   back to the blob it was executing beforehand.
   If there isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;beforehand&rdquo;,
   the program has finished.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The functions that operate on tables are usually combined to create pipelines.
   A pipeline starts with a table (or with a function that reads a table);
   the output of each function is used as the input of the next in the pipeline,
   and only the output of the last function in the pipeline is displayed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A few notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>This notional machine overlaps with that for Python in many ways,
   which is unsurprising given that they are both dynamically-typed, interactive, and garbage-collected.</li>
<li>The elements in this notional machine <em>aren&rsquo;t</em> presented in the order in which I would teach them;
   this description is the model I want learners to have at the end of an introductory course.</li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t include loops or conditionals,
   since modern R is a mostly-functional language.</li>
<li>It also doesn&rsquo;t include <a href="../../../../2018/11/16/non-standard-evaluation/">non-standard evaluation</a>,
   or try to explain that you can pass column names to functions as if they were variables.
   In my (so far limited) teachinge experience,
   questions about this don&rsquo;t come up:
   I suspect that people who are new to programming don&rsquo;t know enough to realize how weird this is,
   but that&rsquo;s just a guess.
   If NSE is part of your notional machine for novices,
   I&rsquo;d really like to hear what form it takes.</li>
