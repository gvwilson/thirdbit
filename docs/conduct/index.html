<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>



<p>In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of
experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance,
race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.</p>
<h2>Our Standards</h2>
<p>Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>using welcoming and inclusive language,</li>
<li>being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences,</li>
<li>gracefully accepting constructive criticism,</li>
<li>focusing on what is best for the community, and</li>
<li>showing empathy towards other community members.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual
  attention or advances,</li>
<li>trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political
  attacks,</li>
<li>public or private harassment,</li>
<li>publishing others&rsquo; private information, such as a physical or
  electronic address, without explicit permission, and</li>
<li>other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in
  a professional setting</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.</p>
<p>Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any
contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening,
offensive, or harmful.</p>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project email
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.</p>
<h2>Enforcement</h2>
<p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by emailing the project team. All complaints will be reviewed
and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and
appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain
confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.  Further details of
specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.</p>
<p>Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project&rsquo;s leadership.</p>
<h2>Attribution</h2>
<p>This Code of Conduct is adapted from
the <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/">Contributor Covenant</a> version 1.4.</p>
