</p>
      <p>Which of these do you believe is true?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As a student, you own every piece of software you write for course
    assignments.  If the university wants to use that software in any way other
    than for giving you a grade, they need your permission: you can say &ldquo;no&rdquo; or
    ask for payment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You own the software you write for course assignments <em>as long as you do
    the work on your own computer</em>. If you use a university&rsquo;s machines, they
    have an equal right to the software: you can continue developing it or
    sell it if you want, but they can too, and they don&rsquo;t need your permission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are an undergraduate and paying fees to attend a university, you
    own the software you produce. If you are a graduate student being paid a
    stipend, on the other hand, the university owns what you produce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you a graduate student then you, your supervisor, and your university
    all have a right to what you produce.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The answer is, &ldquo;It depends where you are.&rdquo;  Different schools have different
rules, even if they are in the same legal jurisdiction (i.e., the same country,
state, or province). In fact, some universities&rsquo; rules depend not only on who
you are but on which faculty you are in.</p>
<p>The rules in industry are less complex—anything you do on company time or with
company resources belongs to the company—but there are many gray areas. For
example, I wrote some of the first drafts of this book on a company laptop while
traveling for work. Does that mean I owe my former employer a share of the
royalties?</p>
<p>Who owns what is just one of the rights that societies recognize.  Others
guaranteed by the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>
include the right to say what you want, the right to live free from fear, and
the right to be treated the same way as everyone else regardless of your race,
sex, orientation, religion, or disability.  Most countries have signed this
declaration, meaning that in theory at least, it has the force of law.</p>
<p>However, the phrase &ldquo;in theory&rdquo; is doing a lot of work in the previous
paragraph.  In practice, most societies still treat people unequally and
unfairly; the question is, do we acknowledge that and try to fix it, or ignore
it in the hope that when bad things happen, they&rsquo;ll only happen to other people?
What&rsquo;s more, all of our rights have been profoundly affected by what software
engineers have built. If the first rule of being compassionate is to do no harm,
the first step in becoming a compassionate programmer is to learn what rights
you and other people have.</p>
<h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
<p><a class="gl-ref" href="../glossary/#gl:intellectual_property" markdown="1">Intellectual property</a> (IP) is a catch-all term that covers four separate kinds of
rights: copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and trademarks. Each of these has
evolved over several centuries to address the economic and moral concerns of
people powerful enough to influence law-making. What ties them together is that,
compared with physical goods, information is expensive to produce but cheap to
copy. IP exists to ensure that creators can earn enough from producing
intangible goods that they can keep doing it. Each kind of IP therefore gives
its holder a limited monopoly over some kind of information.</p>
<p><a class="gl-ref" href="../glossary/#gl:copyright" markdown="1">Copyrights</a> apply to any original expression that
anyone creates. While people can&rsquo;t (yet) own facts, they <em>can</em> own any
representation of those facts that contains an element of creativity.  As a
result of this broad scope, there are several exceptions to copyright, making it
the weakest protection available. When placed in the proper context, however,
copyright is a powerful tool for IP protection.</p>
<p><a class="gl-ref" href="../glossary/#gl:patent" markdown="1">Patents</a> apply
to inventions, technological improvements, certain designs, business methods,
and a few other things. They grant a monopoly—the right to exclude others from
using the patented idea—for a fixed period of time (usually twenty years).
Since the right is stronger, the requirements for obtaining a patent are more
stringent: it can take years, hundreds of pages of paperwork, and thousands of
dollars to secure one.</p>
<p>Patents are intended to be a bargain between the inventor and the public: the
inventor discloses how the invention works (so that other people can learn from)
and in exchange society ensures that she is the only one who can profit from it
for a reasonable time. If an inventor doesn&rsquo;t want anyone to know how her
invention works she can treat it as a <a class="gl-ref" href="../glossary/#gl:trade_secret" markdown="1">trade secret</a>.  This isn&rsquo;t a property
right as such, but rather the practice of relying on things like <a class="gl-ref" href="../glossary/#gl:non_disclosure_agreement" markdown="1">non-disclosure agreements</a> (NDA) to keep something secret. There is less risk of someone
being inspired by your idea to create something better, but if the idea <em>does</em>
leak, the inventor has less legal protection.</p>
<p>Finally, <a class="gl-ref" href="../glossary/#gl:trademark" markdown="1">trademarks</a> allow people to tell whether a product is
authentic or not. Given that everyone has limited time in which to make
decisions, a brand name acts as a form of mental shorthand: if company XYZ has a
reputation for high quality or low prices, or if a particular medication has
been proven to be effective against an ailment like heart disease, the name
itself has commercial value.</p>
<h2>Software Licenses</h2>
<p>A <a class="gl-ref" href="../glossary/#gl:license" markdown="1">license</a>
dictates how project materials can be used and redistributed.  If the license or
a publication agreement makes it difficult for people to contribute, the project
is less likely to attract new members, so the choice of license is crucial to
the project&rsquo;s long-term sustainability.</p>
<p>Every creative work automatically has some sort of license; the only question is
whether authors and users know what it is and choose to enforce it.  Choosing a
license for a project can be complex, not least because the law hasn&rsquo;t kept up
with everyday practice; <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Lindberg2008">Lindberg2008</a>]</span> is a good exploration of these
issues if you want details.  Depending on country, institution, and job role,
most creative works are automatically eligible for intellectual property
protection.  However, members of the team may have different levels of copyright
protection.  For example, students and faculty may have a copyright on the
research work they produce, but university staff members may not, since their
employment agreement may state that what they create on the job belongs to their
employer.</p>
<p>To avoid legal messiness, every project should include an explicit license.
This license should be chosen early, since changing a license can be
complicated.  For example, each collaborator may hold copyright on their work
and therefore need to be asked for approval when a license is changed.
Similarly, changing a license does not change it retroactively, so different
users may wind up operating under different licensing structures.</p>
<div class="callout">
<h3>Leave it to the professionals</h3>
<p>Don&rsquo;t write your own license.
Legalese is a highly technical language, and words don&rsquo;t mean what you think
they do.  What&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s often hard to understand the interactions between
multiple licenses on different kinds of material <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Almeida2017">Almeida2017</a>]</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Just as the project&rsquo;s Code of Conduct is usually placed in a root-level file
called <code>CONDUCT.md</code>, its license is usually put in
a file called <code>LICENSE.md</code> that is also in the
project&rsquo;s root directory.  To make license selection for code as easy as
possible, GitHub allows us to select one of several common software licenses
when creating a repository.  Unfortunately, their list does not include common
licenses for data or written works like papers and reports.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a>
maintains <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">a list</a> of <a class="gl-ref" href="../glossary/#gl:open_license" markdown="1">open licenses</a>, and <a href="https://choosealicense.com/">choosealicense.com</a>
will help us find a license that suits our needs.  In order to choose the right
one, we need to understand the difference between two kinds of license.  The
<a class="gl-ref" href="../glossary/#gl:mit_license" markdown="1">MIT License</a> and its close sibling the <a class="gl-ref" href="../glossary/#gl:bsd_license" markdown="1">BSD License</a> say that people can do whatever
they want to with the software as long as they cite the original source, and
that the authors accept no responsibility if things go wrong.  The <a class="gl-ref" href="../glossary/#gl:gpl" markdown="1">GNU Public License</a> (GPL) gives people similar rights, but requires them to
share their own work on the same terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may copy, distribute and modify the software as long as you track
changes/dates in source files.  Any modifications to or software including
(via compiler) GPL-licensed code must also be made available under the GPL
along with build and install instructions.</p>
<p>— <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-(gpl-3)">tl;dr</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, if someone modifies GPL-licensed software or incorporates it
into their own project, and then distributes what they have created, they have
to distribute the source code for their own work as well.</p>
<p>The GPL was created to prevent companies from taking advantage of open software
without contributing anything back.  The last thirty years have shown that this
restriction isn&rsquo;t necessary: many projects have survived and thrived without
this safeguard.  We therefore recommend that projects choose the MIT license, as it places the
fewest restrictions on future action.</p>
<p>The <a class="gl-ref" href="../glossary/#gl:hippocratic_license" markdown="1">Hippocratic License</a> is a newer license;
where the GPL requires people to share their work, the Hippocratic License
requires them to do no harm.  More precisely, it forbids people from using the
software in ways that violate the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
We have learned the hard way that software and science can be mis-used; adopting
the Hippocratic License is a small step toward preventing this.</p>
<div class="callout">
<h3>What they really mean (part two)</h3>
<p>Just as some people in open source argued against codes of conduct ten years
ago, some now argue that the Hippocratic License isn&rsquo;t a real open source
license because of its &ldquo;do no harm&rdquo; requirement or because the Open Source
Initiative hasn&rsquo;t approved it. The first argument ignores the fact that many
other licenses put restrictions on use; the second argument is like saying, &ldquo;It
wasn&rsquo;t recorded in Nashville so it&rsquo;s not a real country song.&rdquo;  As with
arguments against codes of conduct, what people are usually revealing is that
they prefer a world in which programmers don&rsquo;t have to take responsibility for
how the things they build are used, and would rather not have anyone set a
precedent to the contrary.</p>
</div>
<h2>Creative Commons Licenses</h2>
<p>The MIT license, the GPL, and the Hippocratic License are intended for use with
software.  When it comes to data and reports, the most widely used family of
licenses are those produced by <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative
Commons</a>.  These have been written and checked by
lawyers and are well understood by the community.</p>
<p>The most liberal option is referred to as <a class="gl-ref" href="../glossary/#gl:cc0" markdown="1">CC0</a> where the &ldquo;0&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;zero restrictions&rdquo;.
This puts work in the public domain, i.e., allows anyone who wants to use it to
do so however they want with no restrictions.  CC0 is usually the best choice
for data, since it simplifies aggregate analysis involving datasets from
different sources.</p>
<p>The next step up is the Creative Commons&ndash;Attribution license, usually referred
to as <a class="gl-ref" href="../glossary/#gl:cc_by" markdown="1">CC-BY</a>. This allows people to do whatever they want to with the
work as long as they cite the original source.  This is the best license to use
for papers and report, since you want people to share them widely but also want
to get credit for your work.</p>
<p>Other Creative Commons licenses incorporate various restrictions, and are
usually referred two using the two-letter abbreviations listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>NC (no commercial use)
    does <em>not</em> mean that people cannot charge money for something that includes
    our work, though some publishers still try to imply that in order to scare
    people away from open licensing.  Instead, the NC clause means that people
    cannot charge for something that uses our work without our explicit
    permission, which we can give under whatever terms we want.  (We use the
    CC-BY-NC license for this work.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ND (no derivative works)
    prevents people from creating modified versions of our work.
    Unfortunately, this also inhibits translation and reformatting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SA (share-alike) requires people
    to share work that incorporates ours on the same terms that we used.  Again,
    it is fine in principle but in practice makes aggregation and recombination
    difficult.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="callout">
<h3>Why be open?</h3>
<p><span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Hippel2006">Hippel2006</a>]</span> reports that 85% of all interesting innovations in all
industries come not from the suppliers but from the users.  The more open work
is, the better able users are to tinker with it and do things that the first
contributors would never have thought of trying.</p>
