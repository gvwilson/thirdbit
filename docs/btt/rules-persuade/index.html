      <p>Persuading people to do things is almost as
essential to teamwork as running a good meeting. These simple rules have
served me well.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Don&rsquo;t.</dt>
<dd>If you have to talk someone into something, odds are that they don&rsquo;t really
want to do it.  Respect that: it&rsquo;s almost always better in the long run to
leave some particular thing undone than to use guilt or any underhanded
psychological tricks that will only engender resentment.</dd>
<dt>Be kind.</dt>
<dd>I don&rsquo;t know if there actually is a book called <em>Secret Tricks of the Ninja
Sales Masters</em>, but if there is, it probably tells readers that creating a
sense of obligation or guilt increases the odds of a sale.  That may work,
but it only works once and it&rsquo;s a skeezy thing to do even then.  If, on the
other hand, you are genuinely kind and help other people because it&rsquo;s what
good people do, you just might inspire them to be good people too.</dd>
<dt>Appeal to the greater good.</dt>
<dd>If you open by talking about what&rsquo;s in it for them, you are signalling that
they should think of their interaction with you as a commercial exchange of
value to be bargained over.  Instead, start by explaining how whatever you
want them to help with is going to make the world a better place, and <em>mean
it</em>.  (If what you&rsquo;re proposing isn&rsquo;t going to make the world a better
place, propose something better.)</dd>
<dt>Start small.</dt>
<dd>Most people are understandably reluctant to dive into things head-first, so
give them a chance to test the waters and to get to know you and everyone
else involved in whatever it is you want help with.  Don&rsquo;t be surprised or
disappointed if that&rsquo;s where things end: everyone is busy or tired or has
projects of their own, or maybe just has a different mental model of how
collaboration is supposed to work.  Remember the <a class="gl-ref" href="../glossary/#gl:90_9_1_rule" markdown="1">90-9-1 rule</a>
and set your expectations accordingly.</dd>
<dt>Don&rsquo;t build a project: build a community.</dt>
<dd>There is a softball team here in Toronto that never actually plays games:
their practices are just an excuse for members to enjoy each other&rsquo;s
company.  You probably don&rsquo;t want to go quite that far, but sharing a cup of
tea with someone or celebrating the birth of their first grandchild can get
you things that no reasonable amount of money can.</dd>
<dt>Establish a point of connection.</dt>
<dd>&ldquo;I was speaking to X&rdquo; or &ldquo;we met at Y&rdquo; gives them context, which in turn
makes them more comfortable.  This must be specific: spammers and
cold-callers have trained us all to ignore anything that starts, &ldquo;I recently
came across your website…&rdquo;</dd>
<dt>Be specific about what you are asking for.</dt>
<dd>People need to know this so that they can figure out whether the time and
skills they have are a match for what you need.  Being realistic up front is
also a sign of respect: if you tell people you need a hand moving a few
boxes when you&rsquo;re actually packing up an entire house, they&rsquo;re probably not
going to come back.</dd>
<dt>Establish your credibility.</dt>
<dd>Mention your backers, your size, how long your group has been around, or
something that you&rsquo;ve accomplished in the past so that they&rsquo;ll believe
you&rsquo;re worth taking seriously.</dd>
<dt>Create a slight sense of urgency.</dt>
<dd>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re hoping to launch this in the spring&rdquo; is more likely to get a positive
response than &ldquo;We&rsquo;d eventually like to launch this.&rdquo;  However, the word
&ldquo;slight&rdquo; is also important: if your request is urgent, most people will
assume you&rsquo;re disorganized or that something has gone wrong, and may then
err on the side of prudence.</dd>
<dt>Take a hint.</dt>
<dd>If the first person you ask for help says &ldquo;no&rdquo;, ask someone else.  If the
fifth or the tenth person says &ldquo;no&rdquo;, ask yourself if what you&rsquo;re trying to
do makes sense and is worth doing.</dd>
