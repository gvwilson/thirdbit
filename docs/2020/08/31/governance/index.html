<!-- content --><p>I had another good conversation with <a href="http://exple.tive.org/blarg/">Mike Hoye</a> this week
about life, the Internet, and everything.
I always learn a lot talking with him,
and what I realized this time is that <em>governance should be discoverable</em>.
Pretty much every open source project has a <code>LICENSE.md</code> file in their root directory these days,
and most now have a <code>CONDUCT.md</code> file as well.
These files tell passers-by how they&rsquo;re allowed to use the software
and what social norms they&rsquo;re required to adhere to if they want to contribute to it.</p>
<p>But how can they find out who decides what the project is going to do next,
or who gets a say in deciding that?
Large organizations like the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/">Python Software Foundation</a>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10063">typically have bylaws</a>—as registered non-profits,
they&rsquo;re legally required to—but
<a href="https://opensource.com/open-organization/18/4/new-governance-model-research">most smaller organizations don&rsquo;t explain any of this</a>.
They may have a <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file,
but that usually describes how to set up a build environment and how to file bug reports,
not how decisions are made or by whom.</p>
<p>Spelling this out helps people <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimate_peripheral_participation">make their first contributions</a>,
which <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1007296">helps projects grow</a>.
It&rsquo;s also better ergonomics:
if you don&rsquo;t know who to ask or whose consent you need,
whatever you want probably won&rsquo;t happen.
But most importantly,
it&rsquo;s essential to making a project genuinely inclusive.
Every organization has a power structure;
the only question is <a href="https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm">whether it&rsquo;s accountable or not</a>.
If a group says it doesn&rsquo;t have rules,
what it&rsquo;s really saying is that it&rsquo;s an old boys&rsquo; network,
and that getting things done depends on your personal connections with unofficial influencers
and on how self-confident and assertive you are.
If you didn&rsquo;t get drunk with one of the core developers in college
and you&rsquo;re not willing to barge into discussions,
then no matter how hard you work you might be a second-class citizen of this project forever.</p>
<p>This is why I&rsquo;m convinced that every open project should have a file in its root directory called <code>GOVERNANCE.md</code>
that explains:</p>
<ol>
<li>Who gets a say in which decisions
    (where &ldquo;gets a say&rdquo; means &ldquo;must approve&rdquo; or &ldquo;can veto&rdquo;—promises of consultation
    are a social nicety without such guarantees).</li>
<li>How to get a decision made.</li>
<li>How to find out what decisions have been made.</li>
<li>How to become part of the decision-making process (e.g., how to get a vote).</li>
<li>How to change these rules (i.e., how to amend the constitution).</li>
</ol>
<p>To make explicit governance easier and more consistent,
projects should be able to choose a model from a small set of tried-and-tested alternatives,
just as they pick <a href="https://opensource.org/">an OSI-approved license license</a>
or adopt <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/">the Contributor Covenants</a>.
For example,
a project with a single decision maker (typically the founder) could copy
the <a href="../../../../files/2020/08/buck-stops-here.md">bucks stops here</a> file into its repository,
while a consensus-based team project could use <a href="../../../../files/2020/08/marthas.txt">Martha&rsquo;s Rules</a>.
I don&rsquo;t think we would need many more,
but agreeing on names and wording,
making rules findable,
and providing <a href="https://choosealicense.com/">a simple guide</a>
would make life a little bit easier for a lot of people.</p>

how the <a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> project runs itself and why.</em></p><!-- /content -->
