<!-- content --><p>If I retired tomorrow,
here&rsquo;s how I would would to spend each week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Writing <a href="../../../../fiction/">fiction</a>.
    I&rsquo;m making slow but steady progress on a couple of middle-grade books
    and need another 30,000 words to finish off a YA novel I&rsquo;ve been working on for several years.
    I started writing them for my daughter when she was young;
    she&rsquo;s now in university,
    and unlikely to find them as engaging as she once would have,
    but I&rsquo;d still like to finish them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Helping to assemble a new kind of undergraduate software engineering course
    in which learners explore what it means for programmers to be productive
    and how we can make it <a href="../../../../ideas/se-change/#observe">observable</a>.
    I think this would be a good way to introduce young programmers to
    the difference between reliable research and plausible punditry,
    but I wouldn&rsquo;t want to tackle it on my own:
    I don&rsquo;t (yet) know enough about productivity and observability in software development,
    and too many of the projects that seemed like good ideas to me at the time
    have turned out to have <a href="../../../../2021/07/22/whatever-happened-to-tidyblocks/">fatal flaws</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teaching.
    I&rsquo;m about to teach <a href="https://gvwilson.github.io/change/">a workshop on organizational change</a>,
    and helping with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06484">this paper</a> has convinced me that
    one on how to end projects gracefully would be useful too.
    Really,
    though,
    I just want to get back in the classroom:
    for better or worse,
    AI Is the biggest change in teaching and learning in my adult lifetime,
    and I want to be in the thick of it rather than opining from the sidelines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doing housework,
    playing the sax,
    and riding my bike or swimming (depending on the season and the state of my knees).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What I would want most,
though,
is a circle of friends to do these things with.
I love my wife very much,
but I&rsquo;m never going to enjoy gardening or cooking as much as she does,
and boardgames like <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2655/hive">Hive</a>
and <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/194655/santorini">Santorini</a> aren&rsquo;t ever going to be her thing.
I always thought <a href="../../../../2018/03/20/goodbye-jeff/">my younger brother</a> and I
would wind up playing chess in the park in our twilight years;
as the nights grow longer and the leaves begin to turn,
I&rsquo;d like to have other people to do that with.</p><!-- /content -->
