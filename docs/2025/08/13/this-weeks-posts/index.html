<h2>2025-07-30</h2>
<p>You know what would be a really thought-provoking team project for undergrad software engineering students?
Building a dashboard that measures and reports programmers&rsquo; productivity and identifies process bottlenecks.
Lots of coding,
lots of requirements gathering,
lots of UI design,
and <em>lots</em> of &ldquo;what the hell are we actually measuring and do we believe it&rsquo;s meaningful?&rdquo;
which would be the most illuminating part of the whole exercise for them.</p>
<h2>2025-08-09</h2>
<p><a href="../../../../2012/01/21/the-life-i-did-live-the-breath-i-breathed/">My sister Sylvia</a>
died of pancreatic cancer in 2012 at the age of 47,
leaving three teenage children behind.
The mRNA cancer vaccine being developed in the US was the best hope we&rsquo;ve ever had to prevent this.
The Trump Administration&rsquo;s decision to cut funding for this live-saving research based on pseudo-scientific hysteria
condemns more people like my sister to death and more children to grow up without their mothers.</p>
<h2>2025-08-11</h2>
<p>There is a lot of ageism in tech.
One reason,
I think,
is that 30-year-olds spouting recycled Y Combinator bullshit
don&rsquo;t like having the obvious flaws and contradictions in their statements pointed out
by people who&rsquo;ve lived through two or three previous hype cycles.
Not hiring the elderly ensures that they&rsquo;re always in a high-adulation environment,
and never have to worry about whether staff will resist being guilted or bullied into sacrificing their personal lives
for someone else&rsquo;s gain.</p>
<h2>2025-08-12</h2>
<p><a href="https://andreas-zeller.info/">Andreas Zeller</a>&rsquo;s work is the most admirable example of software engineering research I know of.
Over several decades he and his team have done deep theoretical work <em>and</em> translated it into usable tools,
both to see if their ideas work in the real world and as a basis for dialog with developers about what problems to work on next.
(Go ahead, check out <em><a href="https://www.fuzzingbook.org/">The Fuzzing Book</a></em>
and <em><a href="https://www.debuggingbook.org/">The Debugging Book</a></em> â€”
you can thank me later.)</p>
<p>If I could go back 20 years and re-start my failed attempt to become a researcher myself,
I would try to do the same thing,
but would focus on developer productivity.
More specifically,
I would try to build deployable tools <em>that programmers would actually use</em>
to find bottlenecks in real-world development processes,
while simultaneously doing the theoretical work needed to figure out
&ldquo;what do we actually mean by &lsquo;productivity&rsquo; and how do we tell if someone&rsquo;s productive or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are lots of products in this space (Swarmia, Flow, etc.)
but I haven&rsquo;t seen something that is
(a) open source,
(b) straightforward to deploy,
(c) actively being improved,
and (d) backed up by the kind of research that <a href="https://www.drcathicks.com/">Cat Hicks</a>
and the contributors to <a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781484242209">this book</a> do.
I think that if we had something like this today,
a lot of the debate about whether AI makes programmers more productive would have a much higher signal-to-noise ratio.</p>
<h2>2025-08-12</h2>
<p>If you are using AI coding tools, please copy your prompt into the generated code as a comment (or have your agent do that):</p>
<ol>
<li>You wrote a precise requirement spec - why throw it away?</li>
<li>It&rsquo;ll help the next person understand the code.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s good context for the AI when you revise the code, too.</li>
<li>It will help researchers who want to study these tools&rsquo; accuracy and effectiveness.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a good way to label code as &ldquo;AI-generated&rdquo; or &ldquo;AI-assisted&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you.</p><!-- /content -->
