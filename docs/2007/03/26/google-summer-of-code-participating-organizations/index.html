<!-- content --><p>As I was paging through the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a> site this morning, I realized that I recognized less than half of the participating organizations.  Ten minutes and twenty-five lines of Python later, I had all their descriptions in a single page for easier printing. (Note: it was only this easy because Google&rsquo;s websters had taken the time to put in clearly-labelled div&rsquo;s—thanks, Google.) So, here they all are—hope it&rsquo;s useful.</p>
<h2>AbiSource</h2>
<p>The AbiSource community consists of a highly skilled group of people interested in, as our tagline states, bringing Word Processing to Everyone. We do this for example by making our software, AbiWord being our flagship product, available on as many (operating) systems as possible, and adapting it for use on the One Laptop Per Child system.</p>
<h2>Adium</h2>
<p>Adium is a free instant messaging application for Mac OS X that can connect to AIM, MSN, Jabber, Yahoo, and more.</p>
<h2>Aqsis Team</h2>
<p>Aqsis is a GPL/LGPL cross-platform photo-realistic 3D rendering solution, based on the RenderMan interface standard defined by Pixar Animation Studios.</p>
<p>Its focus is on stability and production usage with features that include constructive solid geometry, depth-of-field, extensible shading engine (DSOs), instancing, level-of-detail, motion blur, NURBS, procedural plugins, programmable shading, subdivision surfaces, subpixel displacements and more.</p>
<p>We have a good working relationship with other notable open source projects, such as Blender, K-3D, LiquidMaya and MakeHuman.</p>
<h2>Ardour</h2>
<p>Ardour is a 7 year old project to implement a professional quality digital audio workstation for POSIX-like operating systems. Ardour has been featured in many magazines and won several awards. There are approximately 40 contributors to the project over the last 5 years, and 9 developers with repository commit priviledges. We run a very active IRC channel,</p>
<p>Ardour offers student a rare chance to work on hard design problems, real time coding and complex GUI design in a real and exciting application.</p>
<h2>ArgoUML</h2>
<p>The ArgoUML organization is a loose organization around the development of the ArgoUML application. I, Linus Tolke, am the project leader, then we have a handful very active contributors and twenty or so, less active contributors.</p>
<h2>Audacious Media Player</h2>
<p>Audacious is a successor to Beep Media Player, a GTK2 port of XMMS. Our direction is different than BMPx/BMP2 in that we started by rewriting what was there, instead of starting from scratch. The project is going strong with about 15-20 developers working on it now.</p>
<h2>Bazaar</h2>
<p>Bazaar is a free decentralized revision control system.  Bazaar is written in Python and runs on Unix, Windows and Mac OS.</p>
<p>Bazaar is sponsored by Canonical Ltd, which also sponsors development of Ubuntu.  Some Bazaar developers are employed by Canonical.</p>
<h2>BBC Research</h2>
<p>The BBC exists to enrich people&rsquo;s lives with great programmes and service that inform, educate and entertain. Its vision is to be the most creative, trusted organisation in the world. We&rsquo;re looking for people not only interested in the cutting edge of the distribution of television programmes over the internet to our audience, but also component technologies encouraging reuse, and collaborative system, specifically interested in using our Kamaelia (mainly python) &amp; Dirac (mainly C++) open source projects.</p>
<p>Kamaelia is a research tool for producing anything from PVRs, collaborative whiteboards, games through to streaming servers making parallelism simple through a component approach. Dirac is a next generation wavelet based video codec. The BBC also has a number of other open source projects - which can be found at http://www.bbc.co.uk/opensource/.</p>
<h2>Beagle</h2>
<p>Beagle is a search tool that ransacks your personal information space to find whatever you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>More technically, Beagle is a Linux desktop-independent service which transparently and unobtrusively indexes your data in real-time. Beagle supports many different data sources and file formats.  To learn more about Beagle, visit http://beagle-project.org.</p>
<p>We are a fairly small group of hackers working on making desktop search &lsquo;Just Work&rsquo; for Linux desktop users.  Beagle has been around for nearly three years, and ships with most Linux distributions, including Novell&rsquo;s SUSE-based distributions, Fedora, Ubuntu, Gentoo, and many others.</p>
<h2>Blender Foundation</h2>
<p>The Blender Foundation is an independent organisation (a Dutch &lsquo;stichting&rsquo;), acting as a non-profit public benefit corporation, with the following goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To establish services for active users and developers of Blender</li>
  <li>To maintain and improve the current Blender product via a public accessible source code system under the GNU GPL license</li>
  <li>To establish funding or revenue mechanisms that serve the foundation's goals and cover the foundation's expenses</li>
  <li>To give the worldwide Internet community access to 3D technology in general, with Blender as a core</li>
</ul>
<h2>Boost C++</h2>
<p>Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.</p>
<p>We emphasize libraries that work well with the C++ Standard Library. Boost libraries are intended to be widely useful, and usable across a broad spectrum of applications. The Boost license encourages both commercial and non-commercial use.</p>
<h2>BZFlag</h2>
<p>BZFlag is maintained by a rather large, active, and distributed base of users from all around the world.  The project is one of the most successful and sustained cross-platform open source games ever with an active developer, administrative, and player community.  With more than a million downloads in the last five years alone, more than 200 players online at any time of day or night, and having been under active development since 1992, the project has actually become even more popular over the years as the game continues to grow and as improvements are made to BZFlag.</p>
<p>Our developer community presently consists of a primary core of developers that have made extensive contributions to the game and remained active over many years, along with about a dozen apprentice-level developers that are coming up in the ranks, and about two dozen peripheral/casual developers, extension developers, and web integration programmers.  All of our project developers live and collaborate on the #bzflag IRC channel exclusively, which is the hub of all of our development and network infrastructure administration. From IRC, we administer network operations for the approximate 10k+ active player base and 200+ public servers.  As we are predominantly a globally distributed network-oriented game, we also maintain the public server listings, provide player tracking, network statistics, global authentication, user and group management, abuse and ban controls, player support, league management, and more.</p>
<p>Our group is organized to the extent of coordinating and holding developer meetings (via IRC) as needed for important development discussions.  We operate via a benevolent dictatorship combined with a meritocracy amongst the core developers.  Extensive discussions are held for any changes to the game that affect the &lsquo;spirit&rsquo;, environment, and types of interactions found in the game, including the addition of new features such as new flags and enhanced graphics. We also serve as a support arm to our user community assisting them with anything from how to get started with the game to setting up their own server to writing their own new extensions to the game.</p>
<h2>Casetta</h2>
<p>Casetta Projet aims to build a collection of free software to manage data of the Casio graphical and programmable calculators. It&rsquo;s the only free and multi-platform solution available, and the only software to manage the data of these calculators under GNU/Linux.</p>
<p>Casetta Projet meets three needs:</p>
<ol>
  <li>a transfer tool to receive and send data from/to a calculator.</li>
  <li>a format converter to let Casetta manage all formats used in proprietary softwares under Windows.</li>
  <li>a graphical user interface to provide for users a simple way to manage their data, and for developers a good development environment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Casetta Project is divided into three sub-project, written in Python:</p>
<ol>
  <li>casetta: a python module to manage the data, format conversion and transfers.</li>
  <li>casetta_cli: a command line interface (can be useful for mass conversion).</li>
  <li>casetta_gtk: a GUI, written in GTK+2, to provide an easy interface to edit various data type or for format conversion.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another goal of Casetta project is to write documentation about several proprietary file formats of calculator, to help everyone to work in this domain.</p>
<h2>Center for the Study of Complex Systems (CSCS), University of Michigan</h2>
<p>The Center for the Study of Complex Systems (CSCS) is a broadly interdisciplinary unit within the College of Literature, Science and the Arts (LSA) of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan. CSCS&rsquo;s mission is to encourage and facilitate research and education in the general area of nonlinear, dynamical and adaptive systems. Participating faculty represent nearly every college of the University. The Center is based on the recognition that many different kinds of systems which include self-regulation, feedback or adaptation in their dynamics, may have a common underlying structure despite their apparent differences.  Moreover, these deep structural similarities can be exploited to transfer methods of analysis and understanding from one field to another. In addition to developing deeper understandings of specific systems, interdisciplinary approaches should help elucidate the general structure and behavior of complex systems, and move us toward a deeper appreciation of the general nature of such systems.</p>
<h2>CLAM (at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra)</h2>
<p>CLAM (C++ Library for Audio and Music) is a project that aims at developing a full-featured application framework for Audio and Music Applications. It offers a conceptual metamodel as well as many different tools for that particular domain. One of its most relevant features is the availability of a visual building dataflow application that allows to develop rapid prototypes without writing code.  The project started 6 years ago and, after winning the ACM award to the Best Open Source Multimedia Software in 2006 it is now ready to publish its 1.0 release.</p>
<p>CLAM is mostly developed and hosted by the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona, Spain) but also at the University of California Santa Barbara.</p>
<h2>Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility</h2>
<p>CPSR is a progressive, global organization aimed at helping computer scientists, engineers and technologists promote the responsible use of computer technology.

</ol>
<h2>Django (Lawrence-Journal World)</h2>
<p>World Online is the online division of the Lawrence Journal-World. We originally developed Django as an internal project, and we now support and sponsor Django as an open source project.</p>
<h2>Dojo Foundation</h2>
<p>The Dojo Foundation promotes the adoption of Dojo and provides a healthy environment for JavaScript engineering of every stripe.</p>
<p>Dojo is an Open Source DHTML toolkit written in JavaScript. It aims to solve some long-standing historical problems with DHTML which prevented mass adoption of dynamic web application development. Dojo allows you to easily build dynamic capabilities into web pages and any other environment that supports JavaScript sanely. You can use the components that Dojo provides to make your web sites more useable, responsive, and functional. With Dojo you can build degradeable user interfaces more easily, prototype interactive widgets quickly, and animate transitions. You can use the lower-level APIs and compatibility layers from Dojo to write portable JavaScript and simplify complex scripts. Dojo&rsquo;s event system, I/O APIs, and generic language enhancement form the basis of a powerful programming environment. You can use the Dojo build tools to write command-line unit-tests for your JavaScript code. The Dojo build process helps you optimize your JavaScript for deployment by grouping sets of files together and reuse those groups through &lsquo;profiles&rsquo;. In addition to all this power for your web applications, you can use the power of the Dojo Toolkit in any sane JavaScript environment such as Mozilla Rhino. With over 100,000 downloads of our 0.4 release, its also pretty popular and high-profile.</p>
<p>In addition to the Dojo Toolkit, the OpenRecord (http://www.openrecord.org) and Cometd (http://www.cometd.org) projects are part of the Dojo Foundation.</p>
<p>We have set up a summer of code blog discussing the various projects and what else is going on… check it out at http://dojotoolkit.org/support/soc</p>

<h2>Freenet Project Inc</h2>
<p>Freenet: Freenet is free software which lets you publish and obtain information on the Internet without fear of censorship. To achieve this freedom, the network is entirely decentralized and publishers and consumers of information are anonymous. Without anonymity there can never be true freedom of speech, and without decentralization the network will be vulnerable to attack.</p>
<p>FPI: The specific purpose of this corporation is to assist in developing and disseminating technological solutions to further the open and democratic distribution of information over the Internet or its successor electronic communication networks or organizations. It is also the purpose of this organization to guarantee consenting individuals the free, unmediated, and unimpeded reception and impartation of all intellectual, scientific, literary, social, artistic, creative, human rights, and cultural expressions, opinions and ideas without interference or limitation by or service to state, private, or special interests. It is also the purpose of this organization to educate the world community and be an advocate of these purposes.</p>
<h2>Freevo</h2>
<p>Home Theater Platform. Freevo contains different modules for controlling a PC with a remote on a TV. Unlike other projects Freevo tries to reuse existing other applications such as mplayer, xine and gstreamer for this task. The new API is designed to be very flexible, splitting the logic into several independent modules that can also be used by other projects. It contains a subproject kaa with the different modules and the GeeXboX project has joined the Freevo team to create a Live-CD based on Freevo 2.0.</p>
<h2>Gaim</h2>

Many more are considering Git adoption.</p>
<p>This achievement is the product of the Git development community, a loose-knit team of developers, technical writers, and end users with a passion for high quality open-source development.</p>
<h2>GNOME</h2>
<p>The GNOME project provides two things: The GNOME desktop environment, an intuitive and attractive desktop for users, and the GNOME development platform, an extensive framework for building applications that integrate into the rest of the desktop.</p>
<h2>GNU Project</h2>
<p>The GNU Project was launched in 1984 to develop a complete Unix-like operating system which is free software: the GNU system. Variants of the GNU operating system, which use the kernel called Linux, are now widely used; though these systems are often referred to as &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;, they are more accurately called GNU/Linux systems.</p>
<h2>GnuCash</h2>
<p>GnuCash is an Open Source Financial Application that provides Personal and Business Accounting.  Some would say that GnuCash is a Quicken or Quickbooks replacement, but that&rsquo;s not completely accurate. We&rsquo;re a loose group of developers run mostly like a meritocracy. Patches are welcome from anyone, but commit access to the mainline sources are limited to the core developers.  New developers are asked to prove themselves either by sending in patches or by working on a development branch.  Most of our conversations take place either in IRC or on the mailing lists.</p>
<h2>GNUstep</h2>
<p>GNUstep is a cross-platform, object-oriented framework for desktop application development. Based on the OpenStep specification originally created by NeXT (now Apple), GNUstep enables developers to rapidly build sophisticated software by employing a large library of reusable software components.</p>
<h2>Google</h2>
<p>Google&rsquo;s mission is to organize the world&rsquo;s information and make it universally accessible and useful.</p>
<p>As a first step to fulfilling that mission, Google&rsquo;s founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin developed a new approach to online search that took root in a Stanford University dorm room and quickly spread to information seekers around the globe. Google is now widely recognized as the world&rsquo;s largest search engine &ndash; an easy-to-use free service that usually returns relevant results in a fraction of a second.</p>
<p>Note: Google&rsquo;s Ideas page currently links to a list of project ideas for Google Web Toolkit (GWT).</p>
<p>GWT is an open source Java development framework that allows developers to leverage existing Java tools to produce cross-browser compliant AJAX applications.</p>
<p>Google will continue to act as a &lsquo;container&rsquo; organization for students working with a mentor from academia or industry.  For more information, please see the question &lsquo;What if there is no organization doing the kind of open source work I&rsquo;m doing?&rsquo; in the program FAQs, Mentoring Organizations section.</p>
<h2>Haiku</h2>
<p>We are a project dedicated to the creation of a new open source operating system designed from the ground up for desktop computing called Haiku. Inspired by the BeOS, Haiku aims to provide users of all levels with a personal computing experience that is simple yet powerful, and free of any unnecessary complexities. Haiku is supported by Haiku Inc., a 501(c)3 not-for-profit organization founded with the purpose of promoting our project.

<p>IEM provides technology and know-how to composers and musicians in the creation and realization of their works. Since 1990, IEM has collaborated with guest artists in the production and performance of more than 80 new compositions. In this process, many international partnerships have been established.</p>
<p>At IEM, compositions students are trained in musical acoustics, sound synthesis, algorithmic composition, and real-time systems. We have also established an audio engineering curriculum in collaboration with the Technical University in Graz. The most important aspects of our courses is to bring technology and artistic creativity closer together.</p>
<h2>ikiwiki</h2>
<p>The ikiwiki project aims to develop a general-purpose wiki engine, with particular emphasis on personal wikis, project wikis, blogs, and collaborative software development.  We provide several features unique or uncommon amongst wikis:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Rather than inventing yet another simplistic, linear revision control system, ikiwiki uses a standard version control system such as Subversion or Git.  You can edit a wiki by committing to your repository, as well as through a traditional web interface.  This makes ikiwiki ideal for collaborative software development; just keep your wiki in version control next to your software.  You can also take advantage of the features of these systems; for instance, you can keep a local branch of your wiki via Git.</li>
  <li>You can turn any set of pages into an inline news feed, complete with RSS and Atom support.  You can run your weblog on ikiwiki (and many people do), run a Planet-like aggregator for external feeds, or keep a TODO and bug list with tags for completed items.</li>
  <li>ikiwiki provides a wiki compiler, designed to transform your wiki content into a set of static pages.  You can then serve these pages as static content.  ikiwiki will not fall over during a Slashdotting, because page views don't require the ikiwiki CGI; as long as Apache can keep up, your site will survive.  Furthermore, you can choose whether you want to run the ikiwiki CGI for web edits or only handle commits to the underlying version control system; you can even run ikiwiki privately and just manually copy the content to another server.  So if you want to put a wiki up on a server without installing any software on that server, try ikiwiki.</li>
</ol>

<h2>One Laptop Per Child</h2>
<p>One Laptop per Child (OLPC) is a new, non-profit association dedicated to research to develop a $100 laptop—a technology that could revolutionize how we educate the world&rsquo;s children. This initiative was first announced by Nicholas Negroponte at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland in January 2005.</p>
<p>Our goal: to provide children around the world with new opportunities to explore, experiment, and express themselves.</p>
<p>Please note that the $100 laptops—not yet in production—will not be available for sale. The laptops will only be distributed to schools directly through large government initiatives.</p>
<p>Note that most of the work OLPC needs done needs to be done as part of other existing projects, though there will be some OLPC specific opportunities as well.  We expect work done in various projects should conform to the licensing policies of that project; work on OLPC specific projects will likely be GPL/LGPL/MIT, depending on precise circumstances, to be determined at the time.</p>
<h2>Open Security Foundation (OSVDB)</h2>
<p>OSVDB is an independent and open source database created by and for the security community.

<h2>OpenMRS</h2>
<p>Our world continues to be ravaged by a pandemic of epic proportions, as over 40 million people are infected with or dying from HIV/AIDS &ndash; most (up to 95%) are in developing countries.  Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers.  Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases…if anything at all.  To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts.</p>
<p>As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries &ndash; a tide which rises all ships. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (http://regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (http://pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy.  These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in several African countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, and Tanzania. This work is supported in part by organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Rockefeller Foundation, and the President&rsquo;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).</p>

<h2>OpenSolaris</h2>
<p>The OpenSolaris project is an open source project which was initially based on the source code for the Solaris operating system. It is a community development effort, providing a forum to collaborate and improve operating system technology. The community has grown from its original roots in Sun Microsystems to be part of a much wider community, incorporating a wider set of interests and ideas, to where it is today, a diverse community of people from many different backgrounds, right across the world contributing to the project.</p>
<p>The governance constitution details the OpenSolaris community organizational structure as a whole, http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/cab/governance/, loosely described as a set of community groups growing up around a set of projects and technologies, each formed by various participants, contributors and core contributors (or members), working under the guidance of the OpenSolaris Governing Board.</p>
<p>The community has well over 20,000 officially registered participants, spread over 40+ community groups, and 50+ user groups worldwide. OpenSolaris also has several distributions derived from the base operating system, including Nexenta, Belenix, and Solaris Express. The number of people contributing code is still relatively small due to some infrastructural barriers in moving the source code management system out behind Sun walls. We have made significant progress in this over the last year, and the beta program for a fully read/write Mercurial repository available is nearing the end.</p>
<h2>Oregon State University Open Source Lab (OSU OSL)</h2>

<h2>Portland State University</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re the Portland State University Summer of Code team, hoping to participate in a third year of this fine activity. In the past two years, we&rsquo;ve successfully mentored 11 students through projects in a variety of areas ranging from the immediately practical to the forward-looking esoteric.</p>
<p>Our specialty is projects that clearly benefit the student, the open source community, and society in general, but have no obvious fit in the standard mentoring organizations. In particular, we tend to focus on small-scale or individual, risky but promising open source &lsquo;seed&rsquo; projects that we think will grow into something great.</p>
<p>We have a tendency to mentor projects in open technology, including Linux kernel driver work and open hardware/software systems work with a solid code component. That said, a number of our projects have been at the applications level as well; one of our strengths is the ability to track down mentors for a wide variety of different kinds of activity. Portland, Oregon is an amazing place, and we&rsquo;re lucky to have access to a strong, diverse open source community.</p>

<h2>SCons Foundation: Next-Generation Build Tool</h2>
<p>SCons is a cross-platform, next-generation build tool. Unlike most other build tools that invent their own mini-language or wedge a scripting language onto some other configuration file syntax, SCons configuration files are actually Python scripts. The flexibility of Python scripting makes it possible to solve complicated build problems in surprisingly small amounts of maintainable code. Its portability (the only requirement is Python 1.5.2 or later), cross-platform features (extensive support for languages and compilers), and reliability (MD5 file signatures, cache) make it an incomparable tool for build masters in particular, and also for many free software projects.</p>
<p>SCons has been an active project since its founding in 2001.  SCons now averages about 7000 downloads per month and has active user and development mailing lists with membership of approximately 450 and 150, respectively, and average monthly traffic of 275 and 100 messages, respectively.</p>
<p>The SCons Foundation was organized in 2003 to hold the copyrights of the SCons source code, and to provide a legal entity for any other organizational necessities (e.g., receiving donations). The Foundation is a Delaware non-profit corporation, but does not currently have 501(c)(3) status.</p>
<h2>Scribus Development Team</h2>
<p>Scribus brings award-winning professional page layout to Linux/Unix, MacOSX, OS/2 and Windows desktops with a combination of &lsquo;press-ready&rsquo; output and new approaches to page layout.</p>
<h2>ScummVM</h2>
<p>The ScummVM project allows users to run a variety of classical graphical point-and-click adventure games including Monkey Island, Simon the Sorcerer, Space Quest, and many more. To this end, ScummVM features a complete reimplementation of each supported game engine (Virtual Machine - VM). The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a very agile and diversified development team.</p>
<p>Portability is one of our main concerns, and hence, ScummVM has been ported to numerous platforms: desktop environments (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, *BSD, Solaris, …), game consoles (Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, …), smart phones and PDAs (WinCE, PalmOS or Symbian based), and others (like BeOS, AmigaOS or OS/2).</p>
<h2>SilverStripe CMS &amp; Framework</h2>
<p>SilverStripe is a PHP5/MySQL-based product that is both a content management system (ala Joomla!, Drupal etc) combined with a rich extendable framework for building websites and web-applications (ala Ruby On Rails, CakePHP). While SilverStripe shares all the buzzwords like MVC, AJAX, Web Standards, we realise how difficult it is to build and maintain complex websites.  We are passionate about improving this and differentiate ourselves by putting the user first (important for open source!) and using contemporary technology (e.g. we consciously don&rsquo;t support PHP4 because making it PHP5+ allows us to do elegant object oriented code as found with RoR).</p>
<p>Its proven itself. In the last month since our past major release, we&rsquo;ve been quickly endorsed on Ajaxian.com, on the front page of del.icio.us, had thousands of downloads, and our online community has grown exponentially. Among our blog posts and reviews, is a very informative review at http://www.hiveminds.co.uk/node/3236 and have been invited to present at OSCON 2007. There are a number of reasons we released the SilverStripe platform open source. Not only does it allow us to give something valuable back after years of using open source products ourselves, we feel we&rsquo;re evolving the web community with a genuinely innovative product. Finally, we are so convinced SilverStripe will work best when it is widely adopted that we BSD licensed it. We are personally committed to furthering open source and open standards, which fuel the free and interoperable web and directly improves the world we live in.</p>
<h2>SIP Communicator</h2>
<p>SIP Communicator started out at the Louis Pasteur University in Strasbourg, France (http://www-ulp.u-strasbg.fr) but has grown to include members and contributors from (alphabetically) Brazil, Bulgaria, Germany, Japan, Spain, UK, USA, and others.</p>
<p>SIP Communicator is an audio/video Internet phone and instant messenger written in Java. It supports some of the most popular instant messaging and telephony protocols such as SIP, Jabber (and hence GoogleTalk), AIM/ICQ, MSN, Yahoo! Messenger and soon others like IRC, and IAX. SIP Communicator is completely Open Source / Free Software, and is freely available under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</p>
<p>SIP Communicator is based on the OSGi (http://osgi.org) architecture using the Felix implementation from Apache. This makes it very extensible and particularly developer friendly.</p>
<h2>Sparse</h2>
<p>Sparse, the semantic parser, provides a compiler frontend capable of parsing most of ANSI C as well as many GCC extensions, and a collection of sample compiler backends, including a static analyzer also called &lsquo;sparse&rsquo;. Sparse provides a set of annotations designed to convey semantic information about types, such as what address space pointers point to, or what locks a function acquires or releases.</p>
<p>The Linux kernel community uses Sparse to check for common errors in kernel source code.  Other projects, such as X.org, have begun to use Sparse as well.</p>
<h2>Squeak</h2>
<p>Squeak is a Smalltalk dialect and a programming environment created by many of the original Smalltalk authors. Its first edition was released in 1996, and it&rsquo;s currently at version 3.9, with a 3.10 version under development. It has spawned many related projects, both non-commercial (such as Squeakland, Croquet, Scratch, Sophie) and commercial (Plopp, DabbleDB). It&rsquo;s also the main developer platform for the Seaside web framework.  The Squeak community is helped by the Squeak Foundation, a small organization dedicated to support Squeak&rsquo;s development. The Squeak Foundation will be incorporated as a 501(c) non-profit during 2007.  The Squeak Foundation takes care of all the bureaucratic tasks for the community (providing funding for server and connectivity costs, etc.); all the other tasks and problems, including technical ones, are handled by the community.</p>
<h2>SquirrelMail</h2>

<h2>Swarm Development Group</h2>
<p>The Swarm Development Group (SDG) was founded in September 1999 as a private, not-for-profit organization to support the development of the Swarm Simulation System (Swarm) and the interests of the group members. The purposes of the SDG are to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>advance the state-of-the-art in multi agent based simulation through the continued advancement of the Swarm Simulation System and support of the Swarm user community</li>
  <li>promote the free interchange of multi agent based simulations among computing specialists and the public</li>
  <li>develop and maintain the integrity and competence of individuals engaged in the practice of agent based simulation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Agent-based models (ABMs) are an exciting new approach for learning about and simulating complex systems, and its use is growing rapidly in science and business. As opposed to traditional modeling techniques that represent systems via differential equations for system state, ABMs represent systems as a collection of digital individuals that each have unique characteristics, interact with each other and their environment, and exhibit adaptive behavior.</p>
<p>Swarm is a platform for ABMs that includes: a conceptual framework for designing, describing, and conducting experiments on ABMs; software implementing that framework and providing many handy tools; and a community of users and developers that share ideas, software, and experience. Swarm was the first of several agent-based modeling platforms that are widely used by scientists and students studying complexity in many fields of science. Swarm was originally developed in the mid-1990s by Chris Langton at the Santa Fe Institute and has an active, international user community. Swarm software is a library of Objective-C classes; users code their models in Objective-C, Java, or C++.</p>

<h2>Taste</h2>
<p>Taste is a flexible, fast collaborative filtering engine for Java. The engine takes users&rsquo; preferences for items (&lsquo;tastes&rsquo;) and returns estimated preferences for other items. For example, a site that sells books or CDs could easily use Taste to figure out, from past purchase data, which CDs a customer might be interested in listening to.</p>
<p>See the &lsquo;Ideas&rsquo; link for ways you can help. We need help writing unit tests and profiling performance. We need help designing new APIs. We need help implementing or even researching new collaborative filtering algorithms.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll probably need to be familiar with Java and have some CS background to help. See the application template below for more details about what information you should send in.</p>
<h2>The Apache Software Foundation</h2>
<p>The Apache Software Foundation provides support for the Apache community of open-source software projects. The Apache projects are characterized by a collaborative, consensus based development process, an open and pragmatic software license, and a desire to create high quality software that leads the way in its field. We consider ourselves not simply a group of projects sharing a server, but rather a community of developers and users.</p>
<h2>The Codehaus</h2>
<p>The Codehaus is an open-source project repository with a strong emphasis on Java, focussed on quality components that meet real world needs. We believe in open source as a pragmatic approach to software development, and all our projects are business-friendly in terms of licensing.</p>
<h2>The Electronic Frontier Foundation</h2>
<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), founded in 1990, works in the public interest to protect fundamental civil liberties in the digital age. The Internet and other communication technologies can herald the most liberating era of human history—or the most regulated and controlled.  The EFF works to defend our basic rights to free speech, privacy and free and open communications, and advocates for sane policies on digital copyright, software patents and electronic voting. EFF is a membership supported organization with 27 full-time staff.</p>
<p>We are working closely with The Tor Project (tor.eff.org), a free-software project to build an anonymity toolkit used by individuals, companies, governments, and law enforcement around the world. The Tor network has grown since its start in 2002 to several hundred thousand active users pushing almost 1Gbps of traffic on average. Tor has two full-time developers, plus several dozen other volunteers who help out on a daily basis.  …..  This proposal is a combined submission from EFF and Tor.</p>
<h2>The Fedora Project</h2>
<p>The Fedora Project produces the Fedora Linux distribution, a distribution of Free and Open Source software.  The project is sponsored by Red Hat and driven by the community.</p>
<h2>The Free Software Initiative of Japan</h2>
<p>Non-profit organization which promotes Free Software Movement in Japan, and supports development and activities of Free Software.</p>
<h2>The gEDA Project</h2>
<p>The gEDA Project is an open-source collaborative involved in creating CAD tools running on Linux (and other unix-like variants) useful for electronic design.  Such tools are often called &lsquo;EDA&rsquo; tools, an acronym for &lsquo;Electronic Design Automation&rsquo;.  Since our tools are released under the GPL, we are the gEDA Project &ndash; short for &lsquo;Gpl&rsquo;ed EDA&rsquo; Project.</p>
<p>The gEDA project is almost nine years old although some components of it date back to 1990.  To date, the project has created a set of programs which together provide an end-to-end design flow for printed circuit board (PCB) design.  Rather than presenting the user a single, monolithic application for design, we have roughly ten major applications and several dozen minor utilities which are used in a design flow allowing an engineer to take a circuit design from concept, to schematic, to simulation, layout, and to manufacturable PCBs.  Therefore, we sometimes refer to our programs as &lsquo;the gEDA Suite&rsquo;, since our project is an alliance of many different programs worked on by many different developers.</p>
<p>The gEDA Project has perhaps 10 &ndash; 20 active developers working on different parts of the tool set.  We have seen scores of websites featuring PCBs designed using the gEDA tools.  The Project web page logs thousands of downloads of the gEDA Suite per year.</p>
<p>The gEDA Suite is used by students and hobbyists, as well as by professional engineers and consultants.  We are currently gaining traction as an educational tool at universities in Europe.  Our software has been profiled in EE Times and Linux Journal.</p>
<p>As for formal organization, we are not incorporated as a 503(c), nor do we have any other sort of legal structure.  However, the main developers (about 10 people) maintain regular e-mail contact, the developer e-mail list handles several dozen e-mails per day, and the major developers telephone each other regularly.  Therefore, we feel confident that we have the required organizational depth to provide support for a Google SoC student.</p>
<h2>The GGI Project</h2>
<p>The GGI project is a volunteer organization developing portable lowlevel graphics solution frameworks. It provides various libraries, of which the two most fundamental are LibGII (for input-handling) and LibGGI (for graphical output).  We want to allow any program using GGI to run on any platform or any backend that can act as a display, requiring at most a recompile. Currently supported plateforms are Linux, Windows (MSYS/MingW, Cygwin), Darwin/MacOSX, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris. In addition to native display systems (DirectX, Quartz, X etc…), GGI offers a set of additonal backends that can be multiplexed (file, memory, vnc, …).  Our work is used in lots of noncommercial and commercial projects (see http://www.ggi-project.org/links.html for a short list).</p>
<h2>The Space Telescope Science Institute</h2>
<p>The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) is the science operations center for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST; in orbit since 1990) and for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST; scheduled to be launched in 2013). STScI is located on the Johns Hopkins University Homewood campus in Baltimore, Maryland and was established in 1981 as a community-based science center that is operated for NASA by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA). Today, in addition to performing continuing science operations of HST and preparing for scientific exploration with JWST, STScI manages and operates the Multi-mission Archive at Space Telescope (MAST), the Data Management Center for the Kepler mission and a number of other activities benefiting from its expertise in and infrastructure for supporting the operations of space-based astronomical observatories. The staff at STScI consists of scientists (mostly astronomers and astrophysicists), software engineers, data management and telescope operations personnel, education and public outreach experts, and administrative and business support personnel. There are approximately 100 Ph.D. scientists working at STScI, 15 of which are ESA staff who are on assignment to the HST project. The total STScI staff consists of about 350 people.</p>
<p>STScI operates its missions on behalf of NASA, the worldwide astronomy community, and the general public. The science operations activities directly serve the astronomy community, primarily in the form of HST (and eventually JWST) observations and grants, but also include distributing data from other NASA missions (e.g., Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer, Galaxy Evolution Explorer) and ground-based sky surveys. The ground system development activities create and maintain the software systems needed to provide these services to the astronomy community. STScI&rsquo;s public outreach activities provide a wide range of information, on-line media, and programs for formal educators, planetariums and science museums, and the general public. STScI&rsquo;s award-winning public outreach websites receive millions of hits per month. STScI also serves as a source of guidance to NASA on a range of optical and UV space astrophysics issues.</p>
<p>The STScI staff interacts and communicates with the professional astronomy community through a number of channels, including participation at the bi-annual meetings of the American Astronomical Society, publication of quarterly STScI newsletters and the STScI website, hosting user committees and science working groups, and holding several scientific and technical symposia and workshops each year. These activities enable STScI to disseminate information to the telescope user community as well as enabling the STScI staff to maximize the scientific productivity of the facilities they operate by responding to the needs of the community and of NASA.</p>

<h2>Wikimedia Foundation</h2>
<p>The Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. is an international non-profit organization dedicated to encouraging the growth, development and distribution of free, multilingual content, and to providing the full content of these wiki-based projects to the public free of charge. The Wikimedia Foundation operates some of the largest collaboratively-edited reference projects in the world, including Wikipedia, often measured as one of the 10 most visited websites.</p>
<h2>WinLibre</h2>
<p>WinLibre project is an open source project aimed at popularizing Open Source software. WinLibre is a META-project that was originally targeted for the windows platform (hence its name) but it has evolved during the last 2 years to embrace also the Mac OS and Linux platforms. We are focusing on delivering to our users quality open source software with a strong emphasis on ease of use.</p>
<p>We are mainly maintaining WinLibre (open source software distribution for windows) and MacLibre (open source software distribution for Mac OS X). The Winlibre distribution provides a collection of first-class open-source software bundled in a easy single installer &amp; updater. Through time and thanks to the former editions of the Google Summer Of Code, the Winlibre project has evolved and created other sub-projects to fill gaps in the open-source desktop software offering. The Maclibre distribution is an equivalent to the Winlibre distribution for Mac OS.</p>
<h2>WordPress</h2>
<p>WordPress is the most popular open source blogging software. It is a &lsquo;state-of-the-art semantic personal publishing platform&rsquo;.</p>

Thousands of commercial and non-commercial organizations rely on wxWidgets; notable applications include Audacity, OSAF&rsquo;s Chandler, Juice, AVG Antivirus, Forte Agent, and BitWise IM.</p>
<h2>X.Org</h2>
<p>The X.Org Foundation supports development of the reference open source implementation of the X Window System.</p>
<h2>Xiph.org Foundation</h2>
<p>Xiph.org is an open source project and non-profit corporation dedicated to providing open and free-to-implement multimedia technology as a foundation for an interoperable, level playing field on the internet and other digital distribution networks. Over the past 8 years we have hosted development for all the major patent-free audio and video codec development, including the Vorbis, Speex, FLAC and Theora, the Ogg streaming format, and the Icecast streaming media server.</p>
<p>This year we are also coordinating projects for the Annodex Association under our umbrella. The Annodex project is developing a set of open specifications and open source software to allow the creation of hyperlinked Webs of audio and video integrated with the text-based view of the current Web. Toward this goal, Annodex has done a great deal of work developing tools, browswer plugins and convenience libraries to facilitate adoption of Xiph.org&rsquo;s lower-level technology. As such the two projects have largely aligned goals, but focus on different levels in the stack.</p>
<h2>XMMS2</h2>
<p>XMMS2 is the spiritual successor to the very successful XMMS project. The creators of XMMS got together in 2002 and spun out the XMMS2 sister project that is now lead by Tobias Rundstrom and Anders Gustafsson with around 10-15 regular contributors spread over the world (but concentrated in Europe). Our focus has been to separate music playback from the UI in order to provide multiple interfaces and other interesting features. While the code of the music playback engine is starting to mature we have also added features that are expected from modern music players, like a Media library and a powerful way of querying it (Collections).</p>
<h2>XMPP Standards Foundation</h2>
<p>The XSF is the successor to the Jabber Software Foundation. We define open protocols for instant messaging and other real-time applications, using the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). Our technologies grew out of the Jabber open source projects and we still provide support for open source developers through conferences, code bounties, and other mechanisms.</p>
<h2>XWiki</h2>
<p>XWiki is a Java open source wiki under a LGPL license. In addition to being a full-featured wiki, it is also a second generation wiki allowing small collaborative web applications to be written easily and quickly. XWiki has a vibrant community of developers and users, massively expanding during the last year. The community is made of individual users as well as companies around the world which are using XWiki for Intranets and Communities.</p>
<p>One example of an important project built on top of XWiki is Curriki (http://www.curriki.org) which is open source itself and hosted inside XWiki&rsquo;s source repository. Curriki is an online service for creating and sharing open education resources (based on XWiki and the Google Web Toolkit). Note that we plan to also select projects directly related to the work in progress on Curriki.</p>
<h2>Zope Foundation, Inc</h2>
<p>The Zope Foundation has the goal to promote, maintain, and develop the Zope (http://zope.org) platform. It does this by supporting the Zope community. Our community includes the open source community of contributors to the Zope software, contributors to the documentation and web infrastructure, as well as the community of businesses and organizations that use Zope.</p>
<p>The Zope Foundation is the copyright holder of the Zope software and many extensions and associated software. The Zope Foundation also manages the zope.org website, and manages the infrastructure for open source collaboration.</p><!-- /content -->
