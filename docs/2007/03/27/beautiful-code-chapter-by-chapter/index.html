<!-- content --><p><a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596510046/"><em>Beautiful Code</em></a> now has a cover, and I can share the chapter summaries (below the cut). I&rsquo;m very excitedâ€”hope to have hardcopy in a month or so.</p>
<p>Chapter 1, <cite>A Regular Expression Matcher</cite>, by Brian Kernighan, shows how deep insight into a language and a problem can lead to a concise and elegant solution.</p>
<p>Chapter 2, <cite>Subversion&rsquo;s Delta Editor: Interface as Ontology</cite>, by Karl Fogel, starts with a well-chosen abstraction and demonstrates its unifying effects on the system&rsquo;s further development.</p>
<p>Chapter 3, <cite>The Most Beautiful Code I Never Wrote</cite>, by Jon Bentley, suggests how to measure a procedure without actually executing the procedure.</p>
<p>Chapter 4, <cite>Finding Things</cite>, by Tim Bray, draws together many strands in Computer Science in an exploration of a problem that is fundamental to many computing tasks.</p>
<p>Chapter 5, <cite>Correct, Beautiful, Fast (In That Order): Lessons From Designing XML Verifiers</cite>, by Elliotte Rusty Harold, reconciles the often conflicting goals of thoroughness and good performance.</p>
<p>Chapter 6, <cite>Framework for Integrated Test: Beauty through Fragility</cite>, by Michael Feathers, presents an example that breaks the rules and achieves its own elegant solution.</p>
<p>Chapter 7, <cite>Beautiful Tests</cite>, by Alberto Savoia, shows how a broad, creative approach to testing can not only eliminate bugs but turn you into a better programmer.</p>
<p>Chapter 8, <cite>On-the-Fly Code Generation for Image Processing</cite>, by Charles Petzold, drops down a level to improve performance while maintaining portability.</p>
<p>Chapter 9, <cite>Top Down Operator Precedence</cite>, by Douglas Crockford, revives an almost forgotten parsing technique and shows its new relevance to the popular JavaScript language.</p>
<p>Chapter 10, <cite>The Quest for an Accelerated Population Count</cite>, by Henry Warren, reveals the impact that some clever algorithms can have on even a seemingly simple problem.</p>
<p>Chapter 11, <cite>Secure Communication: The Technology of Freedom</cite>, by Ashish Gulhati, presents the history of a bold solution to securing email, a long sought-for solution to a universal computing problem.</p>
<p>Chapter 12, <cite>Growing Beautiful Code in BioPerl</cite>, by Lincoln Stein, shows how the combination of a flexible language and a custom-designed module can make it easy for people with modest programming skills to create powerful visualizations for their data.</p>
<p>Chapter 13, <cite>The Design of the Gene Sorter</cite>, by Jim Kent, combines simple building blocks to produce a robust and valuable tool for gene researchers.</p>
<p>Chapter 14, <cite>How Elegant Code Evolves With Hardware: The Case Of Gaussian Elimination</cite>, by Jack Dongarra and Piotr Luszczek, surveys the history of LINPACK and related major software packages, to show how assumptions must constantly be re-evaluated in the face of new computing architectures.</p>
<p>Chapter 15, <cite>The Long-Term Benefits of Beautiful Design</cite>, by Adam Kolawa, explains how attention to good design principles many decades ago helped CERN&rsquo;s widely used mathematical library (the predecessor of LINPACK) stand the test of time.</p>
<p>Chapter 16, <cite>The Linux Kernel Driver Model: The Benefits of Working Together</cite>, by Greg Kroah-Hartman, explains how many efforts by different collaborators to solve different problems led to the successful evolution of a complex, multithreaded system.</p>
<p>Chapter 17, <cite>Another Level of Indirection</cite>, by Diomidis Spinellis, shows how the flexibility and maintainability of the FreeBSD kernel is promoted by abstracting operations done in common by many drivers and filesystem modules.</p>
<p>Chapter 18, <cite>Python&rsquo;s Dictionary Implementation: Being All Things to All People</cite>, by Andrew Kuchling, explains how a careful design combined with accommodations for a few special cases allows a language feature to support many different uses.</p>
<p>Chapter 19, <cite>Multi-Dimensional Iterators in NumPy</cite>, by Travis E. Oliphant, takes you through the deisgn steps that succeed in hiding complexity under a simple interface.</p>
<p>Chapter 20, <cite>A Highly Reliable Enterprise System for NASA&rsquo;s Mars Rover Mission</cite>, by Ronald Mak, uses industry standards, best practices, and Java technologies to meet the requirements of a NASA expedition where reliability cannot be in doubt.</p>
<p>Chapter 21, <cite>ERP5: Designing for Maximum Adaptability</cite>, by Rogerio Atem de Carvalho and Rafael Monnerat, shows how a powerful ERP systemsystem can be developed with free software tools and a flexible architecture.</p>
<p>Chapter 22, <cite>A Spoonful of Sewage</cite>, by Bryan Cantrill, lets the reader accompany the author through a hair-raising bug scare and a clever solution that violated expectations.</p>
<p>Chapter 23, <cite>Distributed Programming with MapReduce</cite>, by Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat, describes a system that provides an easy-to-use programming abstraction for large-scale distributed data processing at Google that automatically handles many difficult aspects of distributed computation, including automatic parallelization, load balancing, and failure handling.</p>
<p>Chapter 24, <cite>Beautiful Concurrency</cite>, by Simon Peyton Jones, removes much of the difficulty of parallel program through Software Transactional Memory, demonstrated here using Haskell.</p>
<p>Chapter 25, <cite>Syntactic Abstraction: The syntax-case Expander</cite>, by Kent Dybvig, shows how macros&ndash;a key feature of many languages and systems&ndash;can be protected in Scheme from producing erroneous output.</p>
<p>Chapter 26, <cite>Labor-Saving Architecture: An Object-Oriented Framework for Networked Software</cite>, by William Otte and Douglas C. Schmidt, applies a range of standard object-oriented design techniques, such as patterns and frameworks, to distributed logging to keep the system flexible and modular.</p>
<p>Chapter 27, <cite>Integrating Business Partners the RESTful Way</cite>, by Andrew Patzer, demonstrates a designer&rsquo;s respect for his programmers by matching the design of a B2B web service to its requirements.</p>
<p>Chapter 28, <cite>Beautiful Debugging</cite>, by Andreas Zeller, shows how a disciplined approach to validating code can reduce the time it takes to track down errors.</p>
<p>Chapter 29, <cite>Treating Code as an Essay</cite>, by Yukihiro Matsumoto, lays out some challenging principles that drove his design of the Ruby programming language, and that, by extension, will help produce better software in general.</p>
<p>Chapter 30, <cite>When a Button Is All That Connects You to the World</cite>, by Arun Mehta, takes you on a tour through the astounding interface design choices involved in a text editing system that allow people with severe motor disabilities, like Professor Stephen Hawking, to communicate via a computer.</p>
<p>Chapter 31, <cite>Emacspeak: The Complete Audio Desktop</cite>, by TV Raman, shows how Lisp&rsquo;s advice facility can be used with the Emacs to address a general need&ndash;generating rich spoken output&ndash;that cuts across all aspects of the Emacs environment, without modifying the underlying source code of a large software system.</p>
<p>Chapter 32, <cite>Code in Motion</cite>, by Laura Wingerd and Christopher Seiwald, lists some simple rules that have unexpectedly strong impacts on programming accuracy.</p>
<p>Chapter 33, <cite>Writing Programs for &ldquo;The Book&rdquo;</cite>, by Brian Hayes, explores the frustrations of solving a seemingly simple problem in computational geometry, and its surprising resolution.</p><!-- /content -->
