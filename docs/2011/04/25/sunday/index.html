<!-- content --><p>Today, my friends Jorge and Val welcomed their first child, Aurora Aranda-Cortés, into the world. And today, for the first time in nine years, my sister and her family didn&rsquo;t have Easter dinner with my parents, because she is too ill to make the 40 minute journey.</p>
<hr />

<p>The Morris dance is common to all inhabited worlds in the multiverse.</p>
<p>It is danced under blue skies to celebrate the quickening of the soil and under bare stars because it&rsquo;s springtime and with any luck the carbon dioxide will unfreeze again. The imperative is felt by deep-sea beings who have never seen the sun and urban humans whose only connection with the cycles of nature is that their Volvo once ran over a sheep.</p>
<p>It is danced innocently by raggedy-bearded young mathematicians to an inexpert accordion rendering of &ldquo;Mrs Widgery&rsquo;s Lodger&rdquo; and ruthlessly by such as the Ninja Morris Men of New Ankh, who can do strange and terrible things with a simple handkerchief and a bell.</p>
<p>And it is never danced properly.</p>
<p>Except on the Discworld, which is flat and supported on the backs of four elephants which travel through space on the shell of Great A&rsquo;Tuin, the world turtle.</p>
<p>And even there, only in one place have they got it right. It&rsquo;s a small village high in the Ramtop Mountains, where the big and simple secret is handed down across the generations.</p>
<p>There, the men dance on the first day of spring, backwards and forwards, bells tied under their knees, white shirts flapping. People come and watch. There&rsquo;s an ox roast afterwards, and it&rsquo;s generally considered a nice day out for the all the family.</p>
<p>But that isn&rsquo;t the secret.</p>
<p>The secret is the <em>other</em> dance.</p>
<p>In the village in the Ramtops where they understand what the Morris dance is all about, they dance it just once, at dawn, on the first day of spring. They don&rsquo;t dance it after that, all through the summer. After all, what would be the point? What use would it be?</p>
<p>But on a certain day when the nights are drawing in, the dancers leave work early and take, from attics and cupboards, the <em>other</em> costume, the black one, and the <em>other</em> bells. And they go by separate ways to a valley among the leafless trees. They don&rsquo;t speak. There is no music. It&rsquo;s very hard to imagine what kind there could be.</p>
<p>The bells don&rsquo;t ring. They&rsquo;re made of octiron, a magic metal. But they&rsquo;re not, precisely, silent bells. Silence is merely the absence of noise. They make the opposite of noise, a sort of heavily textured silence.</p>
<p>And in the cold afternoon, as the light drains from the sky, among the frosty leaves and in the damp air, they dance the <em>other</em> Morris. Because of the balance of things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to dance both, they say. Otherwise you can&rsquo;t dance either.</p>
<p>–Terry Pratchett, <em>Reaper Man</em>, 1991</p><!-- /content -->
