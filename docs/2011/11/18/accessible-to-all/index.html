<!-- content --><p>Back in the late 1990s, I volunteered for a while with the <a href="http://www.cnib.ca">CNIB</a> helping a young woman finish off her high school diploma. (She was already in college, but they wouldn&rsquo;t let her graduate until she&rsquo;d officially completed Grade 12.) The first course I helped her with was Family Studies, and I remember very clearly how I felt when Question 1 on the final exam began with the words, &ldquo;Examine the graph in Figure 1…&rdquo; This course was officially rated &ldquo;Accessible to the Visually Impaired&rdquo; by the Ministry of Education, but clearly, somebody hadn&rsquo;t actually tested the materials. As an answer to the question, she had me write, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t—I&rsquo;m blind,&rdquo; but it still took four months of phone calls and letters to get someone to mark that exam out of 75 instead of out of 100.</p>
<p>Jump ahead to the fall of 2010. I had (literally) bumped into a computer science instructor at the University of Toronto who happens to be unsighted, and I mentioned the videos I&rsquo;d been posting on the Software Carpentry site. He was teaching an introductory programming class; maybe the material would be useful to his students? He hemmed and hawed for a moment, then admitted that he&rsquo;d actually visited the site, but hadn&rsquo;t been able to follow the lectures. Yes, there were full-text transcripts of what I was saying, but (and here he actually sounded apologetic) he wasn&rsquo;t deaf: he was blind. Whenever I referred to a diagram or mentioned &ldquo;the highlighted bit of code&rdquo;, he lost the thread. Those diagrams and highlights only existed as pixels, not as some kind of markup that a screen reader or other tool could &ldquo;render&rdquo; for him.</p>
<p>Now, take a moment and go pretty much any online education site, like the <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> or MIT&rsquo;s <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu">OpenCourseWare</a>. Close your eyes, and see how much of the lecture you can follow. Some aren&rsquo;t bad–Prof. Wyn Kelley&rsquo;s <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/literature/21l-006-american-literature-fall-2002/">American Literature</a> course, for example, works almost as well on an iPod as it does with video. But every time an instructor actually relies on a diagram to explain something, everyone student who&rsquo;s visually impaired loses a couple of marks, either because they can&rsquo;t follow at all, or because the extra time it take sthem to figure it out is time their sighted peers are spending mastering the next topic. Things like the in-browser <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvaaude_1hk">&ldquo;code and sketch&rdquo; tool</a> that John Resig is building for the Khan Academy may look very cool, but what happens to people who can&rsquo;t look? It&rsquo;s no good saying, &ldquo;Let us figure out how to teach online, then we&rsquo;ll worry about special needs,&rdquo; because experience shows that adding accessibility after the fact works just about as well as adding security after the fact (i.e., it doesn&rsquo;t).</p>
<p>Ed-tech&rsquo;s advocates keep saying that they want to make the best teaching accessible to everyone. Respectfully, they&rsquo;re not doing that, and as schools rush to get students online in order to save money, people who are already disadvantaged will be left even further behind. I don&rsquo;t have any answers–I don&rsquo;t think there are any easy ones–but those of us who <em>can</em> see shouldn&rsquo;t lose sight of the needs of those who can&rsquo;t.</p><!-- /content -->
