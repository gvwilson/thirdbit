<!-- content --><p><a href="http://davidcrow.ca/article/7086/democamp-toronto-19">DemoCamp Toronto 19</a> was announced on Thursday, after a 7-month hiatus.  It&rsquo;s moving to a smaller venue as part of an attempt to get away from the &ldquo;trade show&rdquo; feeling of the last few &lsquo;camps—lots of people had said that they were too big, and that the proportion of attendees who might plausibly one day present had shrunk too much.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a smaller venue means there&rsquo;s only room for smaller—er, I mean &ldquo;fewer&rdquo;—people, which in turn makes it harder for newcomers to break in.  The day before the announcement went up on his blog, David tweeted, &ldquo;DemoCamp Toronto details coming tomorrow. Wowsers looks like we&rsquo;re full UPSTAIRS before the announcement, I love the back channel.&rdquo;  On seeing this, one of my students swore and said, &ldquo;OK, so how do I sign up for the &amp;*@!ing back channel?&rdquo; The only comfort I could offer was that I didn&rsquo;t find out about it &lsquo;til after all the tickets had gone either…</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there actually <em>is</em> an answer to this problem. Big get-togethers have low signal-to-noise ratios and require unsustainable levels of effort to organize; small ones have all the problems mentioned above, and meeting more often isn&rsquo;t feasible for people who have children to tickle, companies to run, or assignments due at school.  As David says, there are lots of other &lsquo;camp-style events now in Toronto that make it a lot easier than it used to be to get to know the community; maybe we just have to accept that you have to choose between thousands of fans in a stadium and the intimacy of a coffee-house show.</p><!-- /content -->
