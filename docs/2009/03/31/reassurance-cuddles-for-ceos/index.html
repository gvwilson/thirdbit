<!-- content --><p>Chris Anderson, editor-in-chief of <em>Wired</em> and author of <em>The Long Tail</em>, gave a talk at the MaRS Centre this morning to promote his new book about the economics of free stuff.  I was looking forward to hearing him speak: his resume includes stints at <em>The Economist</em>, <em>Nature</em>, <em>Science</em>, and Los Alamos National Laboratory, so he&rsquo;s obviously a bright guy.</p>
<p>The talk was crap.  There&rsquo;s no other way to say it.  It was superficial, derivative, and stumbling (OK, maybe there <em>are</em> other ways to say it).  None of what he said was original (I was going to say &ldquo;particularly original&rdquo;, but the qualifier isn&rsquo;t needed), and he failed completely to back up any of his claims with anything that looked like evidence.</p>
<p>So why were people listening?  As we walked out, I remembered a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Witch-Doctors-John-Micklethwait/dp/0812928334"><em>The Witch Doctors</em></a> by two other <em>Economist</em> alumni named John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge.  That book is a critical look at the rise of management consulting gurus like Peter Drucker and Tom Peters; somewhere in it, the authors make the point that what people are usually paying for when they hire a high-priced management consultant is not answers, but certainty.  It&rsquo;s the corporate equivalent of the reassurance cuddles I give my two-year-old: &ldquo;Shh, shh, my little CEO, the world might be a big, scary place, but I&rsquo;m going to send all the monsters packing so you can sleep safely tonight.&rdquo;  The audience—mostly thirty-somethings and forty-somethings in suits—weren&rsquo;t looking for subtlety or shades of gray.  They wanted to be told that the future still belonged to them, and like a good free marketeer, Anderson gave them exactly that.</p>
<p>Two things saved the talk from being a complete waste of time.  The first was bumping into the captain of my old Ultimate team, whom I hadn&rsquo;t seen in four years.  The second was Anderson&rsquo;s mention of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium">freemium</a> business model, which reminded me that I wanted to say that I think it&rsquo;s the future of higher education: lectures and course materials will be free, while students will pay per use for tutoring and access to labs, performance spaces, and the like.  A handful of universities will earn their keep by being recognized for honestly administering meaningful examinations (my money&rsquo;s on the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">Open University</a>, by the way, rather than traditional bricks-and-mortar institutions); the rest will become research institutions, winter camps for middle class teens and tweens, or fail.</p>
<p>But that subject deserves both more thought and a longer post.  Right now, I&rsquo;m going to go read my actual two-year-old a goodnight story.  Any CEOs who are reading will just have to wait their turn…</p><!-- /content -->
