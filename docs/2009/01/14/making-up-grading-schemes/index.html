<!-- content --><p>I&rsquo;m running two courses this term, and in both, I&rsquo;m asking students to make up their own grading schemes.</p>
<p>The first course (CSC494 for undergrads, CSC2125 for grad students) is the consulting course I&rsquo;ve run for the past few years. Its aim is to teach students how to work as consultants for real clients, and a big part of that kind of work is scoping out what the client actually wants, and how much of it can be built with the time and resources available.  I found in the past that if I asked students to give me an estimate, what I got was mostly science fiction :-)  If I turn it around and ask them to tell me, &ldquo;How do you want me to grade your work during the term?&rdquo;, they put a lot more effort into figuring out what they&rsquo;re going to deliver when.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of flexibility in what students can submit as a grading scheme.  In some cases, there&rsquo;s a fixed endpoint and very clearly defined subgoals, so they make up a schedule that spaces those subgoals out at two or three week intervals, and we&rsquo;re done.  In other cases (particularly with grad students), the work is much more exploratory, so what I get in the first instance says, &ldquo;Here are the first two deliverables, worth X% of the course, and here&rsquo;s the date by which I&rsquo;ll be able to tell you what else I&rsquo;m going to do and how I want it graded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In both cases, we&rsquo;ll revisit the grading scheme in early March (when students are more than halfway through the project), and give them a chance to re-evaluate.  In most cases, &ldquo;re-revaluate&rdquo; means &ldquo;scale down expectations&rdquo;, but again, the real point is to figure out <em>why</em> the January plan and the March plan are different: what questions could the students have asked in January to create a more realistic plan, or what information did they need that they couldn&rsquo;t possibly have had, and how should they have gone about getting it.</p>
<p>Long story short, students are responsible for putting this together, and doing so forces them to have some real conversations with their clients early in the project.  If in Week 2 a student is asking lots of specific questions, we&rsquo;re probably OK; if a client hasn&rsquo;t heard from him or her yet, or if the questions are still, &ldquo;Um, where do I find an installer for this?&rdquo; then I&rsquo;ll probably bounce their grading scheme back to them with some sour comments and a low grade :-).</p>
<p>My other course is &ldquo;CSC301: Introduction to Software Engineering&rdquo;. This term, instead of posting lecture slides online, I&rsquo;m picking one of the four-person teams in the course at the start of each lecture, and having them write a wiki page about the lecture as an assignment. This is worth 5% of their course grade, and they have to do it twice during the term; once they post it, other students are encouraged to ask questions, make comments, etc., up until one week after the lecture (which is when I give the page a grade—setting a deadline encourages the team to make their page earlier rather than later).</p>
<p>In previous terms, I asked students to make up a grading scheme for Assignment N+1 as part of Assignment N; the idea was to teach them how to write specs (and to give them some appreciation for how hard it is to do that well). This term, I&rsquo;m having teams write assignment specs instead of doing a lecture page (also for 5% of their course grade). We talk through the core ideas in class, and after that, it&rsquo;s down to a bulletin board discussion thread and a wiki page. It seems to be working pretty well so far: students are asking more specific questions earlier than they ever have in any of my previous courses, and (I hope) are feeling more engaged in their education. I&rsquo;ll be very interested to see what they say in the end-of-course feedback.</p><!-- /content -->
