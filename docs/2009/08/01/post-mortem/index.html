<!-- content --><p>Today was the last day of the course, so we spent the morning talking about what had gone well and what had not. The high and low points were:</p>
<h2>Good</h2>
<ul>
<li>The course was fun.</li>
<li>The TAs were fantastic.</li>
<li>The format (one hour of lecture plus two hours of lab, twice a day) worked well.</li>
<li>Enjoyed the parts where the instructors programmed live.</li>
<li>Liked the emphasis on working practices that complement coding.</li>
<li>Liked the spread of topics, and the variability of things that are useful in all the different fields.</li>
<li>Liked the pair programming.</li>
<li>Welcomed exposure to standard libraries that weren't necessarily covered in the course.</li>
<li>Liked the pre-arrival questions about what people knew, were doing, and wanted from the course.</li>
<li>The examples were good.</li>
<li>So were the donuts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bad</h2>
<ul>
<li>Three weeks is too long.</li>
<li>Some of the later topics were not as useful.</li>
<li>Would have preferred to use standard libraries for the image processing lecture and exercises instead of simplified libraries.</li>
<li>Too little coverage of too many subjects.</li>
<li>The formatting of the slides leaves much to be desired.</li>
<li>Too many lectures ran over time (which was particularly hard in afternoon sessions).</li>
<li>Divided attention in FriendFeed is a problem.</li>
<li>The less applied stuff (e.g., computational complexity) wasn't as useful or as interesting.</li>
<li>Students weren't given enough time to work on their own projects.</li>
<li>Didn't feel encouraged to make suggestions or provide feedback.</li>
<li>Not enough on shell programming.</li>
<li>Too much shell programming.</li>
<li>A/V between Toronto and Edmonton was crude by modern standards.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>More on object-oriented programming.</li>
<li>More feedback on the students' solutions to the exercises–they didn't get the equivalent of grading.</li>
<li>Put the exercises up before the class, so that students know what the lecture's going to be leading them to.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's been a good three weeks–I enjoyed getting to know the students, and look forward to seeing what they do with what they've learned.</p><!-- /content -->
