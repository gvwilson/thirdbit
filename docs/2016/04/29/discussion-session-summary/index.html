<!-- content --><p>For the first four months of this year, we ran hour-long lesson
discussion sessions to give people going through instructor training a
chance to ask questions of people who had taught our material several
times.  Trainees told us they were useful for getting information and
as a way to meet more of the community.  We have now decided to merge
those sessions with our weekly workshop debriefing sessions in order
to turn up the volume on both aspects, so this seems like a good time
to summarize what we&rsquo;ve learned so far ourselves.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It was helpful to <em>frame the session as a confidence building
    exercise</em> rather than a test.  Equally, <em>conveying enthusiasm and
    answering basic questions seemed really useful</em>, which has us
    asking yet again if we should record some model workshops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Aleksandra Pawlik&rsquo;s guidelines were very helpful</em>,
    and have now been folded into the instructor
    training course&rsquo;s guidelines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Organizing things through an Etherpad is easy but error-prone.</em>
    We are responding to this by building support for the instructor
    training process into AMY.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The breadth of questions asked was challenging.</em> Some people had
    many very specific points about certain challenge questions or
    pieces of demo code, while others wanted more general information
    about teaching, and it was sometimes difficult to satisfy both
    sets of needs in a single session.  (Ironically, many
    participants&rsquo; primary concern was how to handle workshops when
    learners have diverse backgrounds.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The intermittent demand meant these sessions often weren&rsquo;t an
    efficient use of instructors&rsquo; time.</em> In particular, people often
    hosted sessions with only one or two people, or tried to host a
    session only to have scheduling issues with the one attendee who
    needed a host.  We&rsquo;re addressing this by setting a regular weekly
    time, which in turn makes it feasible for us to have more than one
    host.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite these problems, <em>some attendees were very happy to have
    one-on-one attention</em> where they felt comfortable asking questions
    they feared others might find too basic.  It was good to know that
    these new instructors weren&rsquo;t falling through the cracks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some instructors wound up fielding questions about lessons they
    had never taught themselves, or even ones they had never seen
    taught.  When this happened, they tempered their advice with
    comments along the lines of, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come to own the lesson after
    you&rsquo;ve taught it a couple of times.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some instructors found that <em>people have a somewhat passive
    attitute to the material</em>, i.e., they see themselves as a vehicle
    for delivering set material rather than as innovators and
    interpreters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most importantly, <em>some trainees had low awareness of what
    actually goes on in a workshop</em>.  For example, people asked
    questions like whether or not people would have their own laptops,
    whether they were supposed to ask the challenge problems in class,
    and so on.  This was surprising, given that most trainees are now
    workshop alumni, but clearly signals that we need to spend more
    time covering nuts and bolts in the training course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Timezones make events difficult to schedule</em>, while <em>daylight
    savings time</em> may be the most egregiously stupid idea our species
    has ever implemented (and I say this as a professional
    programmer).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>My thanks to Kate Hertweck, Bill Mills, Neal Davis, Naupaka Zimmerman,
Sue McClatchy, Harriet Dashnow, April Wright, Karin Lagesen, and
everyone else who helped make these sessions possible.  Comments from
new instructors who participated in these sessions would be very
welcome.</p><!-- /content -->
