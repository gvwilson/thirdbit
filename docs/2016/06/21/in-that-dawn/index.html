    "Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive…"

  Jerome Ravetz's recent article
  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2016/jun/08/how-should-we-treat-sciences-growing-pains">How should we treat science's growing pains?</a>
  made me realize something about open science.
  He writes:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    [Science]'s present problems can be explained partly by the
    transformation from the 'little science' of the past to the 'big
    science' or 'industrialised science' of the present…
  </p>
  <p>
    There are two familiar qualitative aspects of the steady
    quantitative growth of the scientific enterprise. The first is the
    loss of '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemeinschaft_and_Gesellschaft">Gemeinschaft</a>', where
    all communities…have become so large that personal acquaintance
    no longer dominates in the professional relationships. The old
    informal systems of rewards and sanctions are no longer
    effective. Under the new 'Gesellschaft' conditions, such intimate
    tasks of governance must be made 'objective'. Ironically, applying
    a 'scientific' methodology to the tasks of governance of science
    leads directly to corruption, since any such system can be
    gamed. Allied to that development is a second one, the hugely
    increased capital-intensity of science, so that the typical
    context of discovery is no longer the scientist with his [sic]
    test-tube, but a large lab with division of labour on an
    industrial scale…
  </p>
  <p>
    Just as this new system was becoming dominant, by a cruel accident
    of fate a third element has intruded: stasis. The social subsystem
    of science whereby it reproduces itself, namely the training and
    certification of postgraduates, depends on the possibility of
    recruitment of at least a significant minority… [W]hen…that
    prospect vanishes, recruitment stalls, and the existing corps of
    researchers is squeezed, many pathologies inevitably ensue. The
    obvious one is the proletarianisation of research work. Recruits
    (and teachers) face the prospect of a lifetime sequence of
    short-term jobs on contracts…Maintaining the lofty ideals of
    independence and integrity becomes increasingly difficult.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  "…all communities…have become so large that personal
  acquaintance no longer dominates…"  "…the typical context of
  discovery is no longer the scientist with his [sic] test-tube, but
  a…division of labour on an industrial scale…"  Maybe that's what
  we're really rebelling against: not the lack of reproducibility, or
  our inability to re-use our colleagues' data, but the loss of
  community.  Maybe the fact that the same people show up over and
  over again at open science meetings isn't a weakness, but a reason
  to be there: after all, it's more fun to be part of a tight-knit
  band of rebels than it is to be a faceless drone working for the
  empire they're trying to overthrow.
</p>
<p>
  Ravetz's article may also explain why so many people in open science
  are drawn to open source software.  It isn't so that they can check
  each other's code–as far as I can tell, scientists still don't
  do that to any significant degree.  Instead, it's that when you're
  building something new, you can do something on a human scale that
  actually matters.  As just one example,
  the <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a> is a big deal in
  open science, but it's a lot smaller than a particle accelerator or
  space telescope, which means everyone who works on it can see the
  difference they're making.
</p>
<p>
  Nobody becomes a scientist in order to figure out how to increase
  the frequency resolution of a linear chirp filter.  We become
  scientists because it's an adventure.  Open science is still new
  enough–still open enough–that individuals can still feel
  that.  And it's still small enough that you can look left and look
  right and recognize the faces you see, and recognize the same
  excitement on them that you feel yourself.

  <em>
    Later: I got mail overnight about this post from someone who
    follows me on Twitter who said that they wished the "open" in
    "open source" and "open science" meant "actually open to all
    comers".  They pointed me
    at this depressing story I'd retweeted about a woman's experience at a
    recent high-performance computing conference, and
    at this picture from a meeting
    about <a href="http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=16252">engineering
    academic software</a> where their presence would apparently have
    increased the number of visible minority participants from zero to
    one, and asked whether I thought they had the same freedom I did
    to build something new, and whether I thought they could look left
    and look right and recognize themselves in the faces they saw.
    The honest answers are "no" and "no"…
