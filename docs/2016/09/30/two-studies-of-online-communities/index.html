<!-- content --><p>Two recent papers may be of interest to this community.  The first is
from Adam Crymble at <a href="http://programminghistorian.org">The Programming
Historian</a> a distributed group of
digital humanities scholars that has built some excellent tutorials on
software tools.  Its title is <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/researchpapers/openLearningCommunities2016.pdf">Identifying and Removing Gender
Barriers in Open Learning
Communities</a>,
and its abstract reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Open online learning communities are susceptible to gender barriers
if not carefully constructed. Gender barriers were identified in
<em>The Programming Historian</em>, through an open online discussion,
which informed an anonymous user survey. The initial discussion
pointed towards two barriers in particular: a technically
challenging submission system and open peer review, as factors that
needed consideration. Findings are put in context of the literature
on gender and online communication, abuse, and online learning
communities. The evidence suggests that open online learning
communities such as <em>The Programming Historian</em> should work actively
to promote a civil environment, and should listen to their
communities about technical and social barriers to participation.
Whenever possible, barriers should be removed entirely, but when
that is not feasible due to financial or technical constraints,
alternatives should be offered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its findings are that the tools they use—that <em>we</em> use—may be a
significant barrier to contribution: &ldquo;Initial comments in the open
conversation made it clear that the choice of venue (Github) was a
gender-barrier, as Github is associated with male geek coding
culture.&rdquo;  On the other hand, &ldquo;…both men and women were
overwhelmingly positive about open peer review (29 like, 6 neutral, 3
dislike, 9 skipped - no gender difference), with the caveat that
moderating by an editor who stepped in to prevent &lsquo;nastiness&rsquo; was
crucial to a successful system of open peer review.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second paper, by Ford, Smith, Guo, and Parnin, is
&ldquo;<a href="https://denaeford.wordpress.com/2016/07/20/paradise-unplugged-barriers-to-stack-overflow-use/">Paradise Unplugged: Identifying Barriers for Female Participation on Stack Overflow</a>&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is no secret that females engage less in programming fields
than males. However, in online communities, such as Stack
Overflow, this gender gap is even more extreme: only 5.8% of
contributors are female. In this paper, we use a mixed-methods
approach to identify contribution barriers females face in online
communities. Through 22 semi-structured interviews with a spectrum
of female users ranging from non-contributors to a top 100 ranked
user of all time, we identified 14 barriers preventing them from
contributing to Stack Overflow. We then conducted a survey with
1470 female and male developers to confirm which barriers are
gender related or general problems for everyone. Females ranked
five barriers significantly higher than males. A few of these
include doubts in the level of expertise needed to contribute,
feeling overwhelmed when competing with a large number of users,
and limited awareness of site features. Still, there were other
barriers that equally impacted all Stack Overflow users or
affected particular groups, such as industry programmers. Finally,
we describe several implications that may encourage increased
participation in the Stack Overflow community across genders and
other demographics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It found five barriers to contribution that are seen as significantly
more problematic by women than by men:</p>
<ul>
<li>lack of awareness of site features</li>
<li>feeling unqualified to answer questions</li>
<li>intimidating community size</li>
<li>discomfort interacting with or relying on strangers</li>
<li>perception that they shouldn&rsquo;t be &ldquo;slacking&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Surprisingly, &ldquo;fear of negative feedback&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t quite make this list,
but would have been the next one added if the authors weren&rsquo;t quite so
strict about their statistical cutoffs.  The authors are careful to
say, &ldquo;…we are not suggesting that only females are affected by these
barriers, or that these barriers are primarily due to gender, but
rather that five barriers were seen as significantly more problematic
by females than by males.&rdquo;</p><!-- /content -->
