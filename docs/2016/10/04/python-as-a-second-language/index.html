<!-- content --><p>Donny Winston, Joey Montoya, and I taught a one-day class for <a href="http://lbl.gov">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>
on Python as a Second Language last week.
As its introductory blurb says,
&ldquo;This lesson is an introduction to programming in Python
for people who are already comfortable in some other language such as Perl or MATLAB.&rdquo;
The notes are still very much under development,
but having delivered it twice,
we&rsquo;re pretty confident that it can actually be delivered in one day.
We would be very grateful for feedback:
please file issues in the GitHub repository
to let us know what you think,
to add more exercises and bullet points,
or anything else.</p>
<p>As well as delivering new(ish) material,
we experimented with having one of the instructors teach via video conferencing with local helpers in the morning,
while on-site instructors taught in the afternoon.
Some of the feedback included:</p>
<p><strong>Positive</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On-line with local help worked very well.</li>
<li>Mixed mode worked well for the first section because the material was easier, might have been more difficult for second half.</li>
<li>Easy to follow, well written exercises.</li>
<li>I thought remote instructor was great…having local instructors was a big part of that though.</li>
<li>Plotting super helpful.</li>
<li>Etherpad being read-only may have helped, so people didn’t mess it up.</li>
<li>Cool, dense content, helpers are very knowledgeable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Negative</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes fast.</li>
<li>Typing is hard to follow as it scrolls off screen.</li>
<li>Pytest can&rsquo;t install.</li>
<li>For online instructor, dual screens may be useful, I’d like to see the Notebook longer.</li>
<li>A bit fast at times, particularly due to the auto scrolling of the screen.</li>
<li>Confusing if you fell behind for a second and the teachers would overwrite, rather than start new cell.</li>
<li>I would have liked to see how python is more typically used, such as IDEs, command line, etc.</li>
<li>Tell people that terminal functionality is needed in advance.</li>
<li>A bit rushed through matplotlib, would have liked more practice plotting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on this feedback and what we heard in the previous round,
we have moved the material on command-line scripts into the &ldquo;Extras&rdquo; section:
there wasn&rsquo;t time to get to it,
and it requires yet another install for Windows users.</p><!-- /content -->
