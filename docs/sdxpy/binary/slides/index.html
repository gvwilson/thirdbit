## Why Binary?

-   Operations are much faster
    -   Write addition using textual digits as an exercise
-   Bits take less space
    -   `"10239472"` is 8 bytes, but `10239472` is just 4
-   How would we represent images, audio, or video as characters?

```txt
 ,_,
(O,O)
(   )
-"-"-
```


---

## Integers

-   If all we have is 1's and 0's, use base-2
-   9<sub>10</sub> is (1×8)+(0×4)+(0×2)+(1×1) = 1001<sub>2</sub>
-   Can write numbers in binary using `0b` prefix

```py
print(0b101101)  # (1 * 32) + (1 * 8) + (1 * 4) + 1
```


```
45
```


---

## Hexadecimal

-   More common to use <a class="gl-ref" href="../../glossary/#gl:hexadecimal" title="A base-16 numerical representation that uses the letters A-F (or a-f) to represent the values from 10 to 15." markdown="1">hexadecimal</a> (base 16)
-   Digits are 0123456789ABCDEF
-   Each digit represents 4 bits (half a byte)

```py
print(0x2D)  # (2 * 16) + 13
```


```
45
```


---

## Negative Numbers

-   Could use <a class="gl-ref" href="../../glossary/#gl:sign_magnitude" title="A binary representation of integers in which one bit indicates whether the value is positive or negative and the remaining bits indicate its magnitude." markdown="1">sign and magnitude</a>
    -   `0100` is 4
    -   `1100` is -4
-   But:
    -   Gives us two zeroes (one positive, one negative)
    -   Makes the hardware to do arithmetic more complicated

---

## Two's Complement

-   <a class="gl-ref" href="../../glossary/#gl:twos_complement" title="A binary representation of integers that &quot;rolls over&quot; like an odometer to represent negative values." markdown="1">Two's complement</a> wraps around like an odometer

<div class="small">
<table>
<tr><th>Base 10</th><th>Base 2</th><th>Base 10</th><th>Base 2</th></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>011</td><td>-1</td><td>111</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>010</td><td>-2</td><td>110</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>001</td><td>-3</td><td>101</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>000</td><td>-4</td><td>100</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

---

## Two's Complement

-   Can still determine sign by looking at the first bit

-   But two's complement is asymmetric

-   No positive number to match the largest negative number

---

## Bitwise Operations

-   Operate on corresponding bits in representation

-   `&` (and) is 1 if both bits are 1, 0 otherwise

    -   `0b1100 & 0b1010 == 0b1000`

    -   `12 & 10 == 8`

-   `|` (or) is 1 if *either* bit is 1, 0 otherwise

    -   `0b1100 | 0b1010 == 0b1110`

    -   `12 | 10 == 14`

---

## Bitwise Operations

<table>
<tr><th> Name        </th><th> Expression </th><th> Bitwise       </th><th> Result          </th></tr>
<tr><td> and         </td><td> 12 & 6   </td><td> 1100 & 0110 </td><td> 4 (0100)    </td></tr>
<tr><td> or          </td><td> 12 | 6   </td><td> 1100 | 0110 </td><td> 14 (1110)   </td></tr>
<tr><td> xor         </td><td> 12 ^ 6   </td><td> 1100 ^ 0110 </td><td> 10 (1010)   </td></tr>
<tr><td> not         </td><td> ~ 6      </td><td> ~ 0110      </td><td> -7(1001)    </td></tr>
<tr><td> left shift  </td><td> 12 << 2  </td><td> 1100 << 2   </td><td> 48 (110000) </td></tr>
<tr><td> right shift </td><td> 12 >> 2  </td><td> 1100 >> 2   </td><td> 3 (0011)    </td></tr>
</table>

## This Is Not Arithmetic

-   Take a closer look at `~6`

    -   We are using two's complement, so 6 is `0b000…00110`

    -   Its bitwise negation is `0b111…11001`, which is -7

-   Shifting up and down is *almost* like multiplying or dividing by 2

-   But what if the top bit changes?

    -   If we only have 4 bits, `0b1111 >> 1` is `0b0111`, so -1/2 is 7

---

## Storing Numbers

-   C and Fortran store numbers as numbers
-   Python used **boxed values**
    -   Reference count
    -   Type code
    -   Value

<figure>
<img src="../boxing.svg" alt="Boxed values"/>
</figure>


---

## Storing Arrays

-   The differences are even larger for arrays and lists

<figure>
<img src="../arrays.svg" alt="Boxed arrays"/>
</figure>


---

## Packing and Unpacking

-   Operations on unboxed (raw) values are much faster
    -   Most numerical libraries written in C or Fortran
    -   Then wrapped in Python or R
-   Need to:
    -   Get data from raw bytes into Python structures
    -   Copy data from Python structures into packed bytes
-   Also do this for efficient storage of large data

---

## The `struct` Module

```py
import struct

fmt = "ii"  # two 32-bit integers
x = 31
y = 65

binary = struct.pack(fmt, x, y)
print("binary representation:", repr(binary))

normal = struct.unpack(fmt, binary)
print("back to normal:", normal)
```


```
binary representation: b'\x1f\x00\x00\x00A\x00\x00\x00'
back to normal: (31, 65)
```


---

## Hexadecimal Again

-   Not all bytes correspond to common characters

-   So Python uses two-digit hex representation `\xPQ`

-   `\x00` is a <a class="gl-ref" href="../../glossary/#gl:null_byte" title="A byte with the value zero. Null bytes are used to mark the ends of strings in C and C++, and are sometimes used to fill unused space in fixed-size binary records." markdown="1">null byte</a> (value 0)

-   Easy to miss the actual `A` between one `\x00` and the next

---

## Packing With Counts

```py
from struct import pack

print(pack("3i", 1, 2, 3))
print(pack("5s", bytes("hello", "utf-8")))
print(pack("5s", bytes("a longer string", "utf-8")))
```


```
b'\x01\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x00\x00\x03\x00\x00\x00'
b'hello'
b'a lon'
```


-   Only packs as much as we tell it to

---

## Dynamic Formats

-   Construct format dynamically

```py
text = "hello"
print(f"{len(text)}s")
```


```
5s
```


---

## Variable-Length Packing

-   Pack strings as a fixed-size count and that many bytes

-   Use `bytes` to convert character string to bytes

```py
def pack_string(as_string):
    as_bytes = bytes(as_string, "utf-8")
    header = pack("i", len(as_bytes))
    format = f"{len(as_bytes)}s"
    body = pack(format, as_bytes)
    return header + body
```


---

## Variable-Length Packing

```py
if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = pack_string("hello!")
    print(repr(result))
```

```
b'\x06\x00\x00\x00hello!'
```


-   First four bytes are the 32-bit integer representation of 6
-   Next six bytes are our characters

---

## Unpacking

```py
def unpack_string(buffer):
   header, body = buffer[:4], buffer[4:]
   length = unpack("i", header)[0]
   format = f"{length}s"
   result = unpack(format, body)[0]
   return str(result, "utf-8")

buffer = pack_string("hello!")
result = unpack_string(buffer)
print(result)
```

```
hello!
```


---

## Bytes and Text

-   ASCII originally defined 128 7-bit characters
    -   0–31 were <a class="gl-ref" href="../../glossary/#gl:control_code" title="Originally a &quot;character&quot; that made a teletype perform some operation, such as moving to the next line or ringing the bell. Only a handful of control codes such as tab and newline are still in common use." markdown="1">control codes</a>
-   Since bytes have 8 bits, programmers used the values 128–255 however they wanted
-   ANSI standard defined (for example) 231<sub>10</sub> to be "ç"
-   But what about Turkish, Devanagari, kanji, hieroglyphics, …?
    -   Two bytes wouldn't be enough
    -   Four bytes per character would quadruple storage requirements
    -   And would mostly not be needed (by American businesses)

---

## Unicode

-   Define a <a class="gl-ref" href="../../glossary/#gl:code_point" title="A number that uniquely identifies a character in the Unicode standard." markdown="1">code point</a> for every character
    -   U+0065 for an upper-case Latin "A"
    -   U+2605 for a black star &#9733;
-   Define several <a class="gl-ref" href="../../glossary/#gl:character_encoding" title="A way to represent characters as bytes. Common examples include ASCII and UTF-8." markdown="1">character encodings</a>
-   UTF-32 uses 32 bits for every character
-   Most popular is <a class="gl-ref" href="../../glossary/#gl:utf_8" title="A way to store the numeric codes representing Unicode characters that is backward-compatible with the older ASCII standard." markdown="1">UTF-8</a>
    -   Code points 0–127 are stored in a single byte with a leading 0
    -   If the top bit is 1, the number of 1's tells UTF-8 how many bytes there are in the character

---

## Unicode

-   If the first byte is `0b11101101`:
    -   The leading 1 means "multibyte"
    -   The next two bits mean "this is a three-byte character"
    -   The first 0 separates the header from the start of the character
    -   The final `1101` is the first four bits of the character
-   Every <a class="gl-ref" href="../../glossary/#gl:continuation_byte" title="The second or subsequent byte in a multi-byte character encoding." markdown="1">continuation byte</a> starts with `10`
    -   So we can tell if a byte is in the middle of a character

---

## Characters as Bytes

```py
result = pack_string("こんにちは!")
print(repr(result))
```

```
b'\x10\x00\x00\x00\xe3\x81\x93\xe3\x82\x93\xe3\x81\xab\xe3\x81\xa1\x \
e3\x81\xaf!'
```

## Binary Mode

-   `open(filename, "r")` converts bytes to characters
    -   And converts Windows line endings `\r\n` to Unix `\n`
-   Use `open(filename, "rb")` to read in <a class="gl-ref" href="../../glossary/#gl:binary_mode" title="An option for reading or writing files in which each byte is transferred literally. The term is used in contrast with text mode." markdown="1">binary mode</a>
