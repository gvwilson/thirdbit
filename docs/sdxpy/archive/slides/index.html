## The Problem

-   Want to save snapshots of work in progress

-   Create a simple <a class="gl-ref" href="../../glossary/#gl:version_control_system" title="A system for managing changes made to software during its development." markdown="1">version control system</a>

-   And show how to test it using mock objects (<a class="x-ref" href="../../protocols/">Chapter 9</a>)

---

## Design

-   Wasteful to store the same file repeatedly

-   So if the file's hash is `abcd1234`, save it as `abcd1234.bck`

    -   Handles renaming

-   Then create a <a class="gl-ref" href="../../glossary/#gl:manifest" title="A list of something&#x27;s parts or components." markdown="1">manifest</a> to show
    what unique blocks of bytes had what names when

---

## Storage

<figure>
<img src="../storage.svg" alt="Backup file storage"/>
</figure>


---

## Finding and Hashing

-   Use globbing (<a class="x-ref" href="../../glob/">Chapter 4</a>) and hashing (<a class="x-ref" href="../../dup/">Chapter 3</a>)

```py
HASH_LEN = 16

def hash_all(root):
    result = []
    for name in glob("**/*.*", root_dir=root, recursive=True):
        full_name = Path(root, name)
        with open(full_name, "rb") as reader:
            data = reader.read()
            hash_code = sha256(data).hexdigest()[:HASH_LEN]
            result.append((name, hash_code))
    return result
```


---

## Finding and Hashing

```
sample_dir
|-- a.txt
|-- b.txt
`-- sub_dir
    `-- c.txt

1 directory, 3 files
```

```sh
python hash_all.py sample_dir
```


```
filename,hash
b.txt,3cf9a1a81f6bdeaf
a.txt,17e682f060b5f8e4
sub_dir/c.txt,5695d82a086b6779
```


---

## Testing

-   Obvious approach is to create lots of files and directories

-   But we want to test what happens when they change,
    which makes things complicated to maintain

-   Use a <a class="gl-ref" href="../../glossary/#gl:mock_object" title="A simplified replacement for part of a program whose behavior is easy to control and predict. Mock objects are used in unit tests to simulate databases, web services, and other complex systems." markdown="1">mock object</a> (<a class="x-ref" href="../../protocols/">Chapter 9</a>)
    instead of the real filesystem

---

## Faking the Filesystem

-   [pyfakefs][pyfakefs] replaces functions like `open`
    with ones that behave the same way
    but act on "files" stored in memory

<figure>
<img src="../mock_fs.svg" alt="Mock filesystem"/>
</figure>


-   `import pyfakefs` automatically creates a fixture called `fs`

---

## Direct Use

```py
from pathlib import Path

def test_simple_example(fs):
    sentence = "This file contains one sentence."
    with open("alpha.txt", "w") as writer:
        writer.write(sentence)
    assert Path("alpha.txt").exists()
    with open("alpha.txt", "r") as reader:
        assert reader.read() == sentence
```


---

## Build Our Own Tree

```py
from pathlib import Path
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def our_fs(fs):
    fs.create_file("a.txt", contents="aaa")
    fs.create_file("b.txt", contents="bbb")
    fs.create_file("sub_dir/c.txt", contents="ccc")

def test_nested_example(our_fs):
    assert Path("a.txt").exists()
    assert Path("b.txt").exists()
    assert Path("sub_dir/c.txt").exists()

def test_deletion_example(our_fs):
    assert Path("a.txt").exists()
    Path("a.txt").unlink()
    assert not Path("a.txt").exists()
```


---

## Running Tests

```py
import pytest

from hash_all import hash_all, HASH_LEN

@pytest.fixture
def our_fs(fs):
    fs.create_file("a.txt", contents="aaa")
    fs.create_file("b.txt", contents="bbb")
    fs.create_file("sub_dir/c.txt", contents="ccc")

def test_hashing(our_fs):
    result = hash_all(".")
    expected = {"a.txt", "b.txt", "sub_dir/c.txt"}
    assert {r[0] for r in result} == expected
    assert all(len(r[1]) == HASH_LEN for r in result)

```


---

## Tracking Backups

-   Store backups and manifests in a directory selected by the user

    -   Real system would support remote storage as well

    -   Which suggests we need to design with multiple back ends in mind

-   Backed-up files are `abcd1234.bck`

-   Manifests are `ssssssssss.csv`,
    where `ssssssssss` is the <a class="gl-ref" href="../../glossary/#gl:utc" title="The standard time against which all others are defined. UTC is the time at longitude 0Â° and is not adjusted for daylight savings. Timestamps are often reported in UTC so that they will be the same no matter what timezone the computer is in." markdown="1">UTC</a> <a class="gl-ref" href="../../glossary/#gl:timestamp" title="A digital identifier showing the time at which something was created or accessed. Timestamps should use ISO date format for portability." markdown="1">timestamp</a>

---

class: aside

## Race Condition

-   Manifest naming scheme fails if we try to create two backups in less than one second

-   A <a class="gl-ref" href="../../glossary/#gl:toctou" title="A race condition in which a process checks the state of something and then operates on it, but some other process might alter that state between the check and the operation." markdown="1">time of check/time of use</a> <a class="gl-ref" href="../../glossary/#gl:race_condition" title="A situation in which a result depends on the order in which two or more concurrent operations are carried out." markdown="1">race condition</a>

-   May seem unlikely, but many bugs and security holes seemed unlikely to their creators

---

## Creating a Backup

```py
def backup(source_dir, backup_dir):
    manifest = hash_all(source_dir)
    timestamp = current_time()
    write_manifest(backup_dir, timestamp, manifest)
    copy_files(source_dir, backup_dir, manifest)
    return manifest
```


-   An example of <a class="gl-ref" href="../../glossary/#gl:successive_refinement" title="See top-down design." markdown="1">successive refinement</a>

---

## Writing the Manifest

-   Create the backup directory if it doesn't already exist

    -   Another race condition

-   Then save CSV

```py
def write_manifest(backup_dir, timestamp, manifest):
    backup_dir = Path(backup_dir)
    if not backup_dir.exists():
        backup_dir.mkdir()
    manifest_file = Path(backup_dir, f"{timestamp}.csv")
    with open(manifest_file, "w") as raw:
        writer = csv.writer(raw)
        writer.writerow(["filename", "hash"])
        writer.writerows(manifest)
```


---

## Saving Files

```py
def copy_files(source_dir, backup_dir, manifest):
    for (filename, hash_code) in manifest:
        source_path = Path(source_dir, filename)
        backup_path = Path(backup_dir, f"{hash_code}.bck")
        if not backup_path.exists():
            shutil.copy(source_path, backup_path)
```


-   Yet another race condition

---

## Setting Up for Testing

```py
FILES = {"a.txt": "aaa", "b.txt": "bbb", "sub_dir/c.txt": "ccc"}

@pytest.fixture
def our_fs(fs):
    for name, contents in FILES.items():
        fs.create_file(name, contents=contents)
```


---

## A Sample Test

```py
def test_nested_example(our_fs):
    timestamp = 1234
    with patch("backup.current_time", return_value=timestamp):
        manifest = backup(".", "/backup")
    assert Path("/backup", f"{timestamp}.csv").exists()
    for filename, hash_code in manifest:
        assert Path("/backup", f"{hash_code}.bck").exists()
```


-   Trust that the hash is correct

-   Should look inside the manifest and check that it lists files correctly

---

## Refactoring

-   Create a <a class="gl-ref" href="../../glossary/#gl:base_class" title="In object-oriented programming, a class from which other classes are derived." markdown="1">base class</a> with the general steps

```py
class Archive:
    def __init__(self, source_dir):
        self._source_dir = source_dir

    def backup(self):
        manifest = hash_all(self._source_dir)
        self._write_manifest(manifest)
        self._copy_files(manifest)
        return manifest
```


-   Derive a <a class="gl-ref" href="../../glossary/#gl:child_class" title="In object-oriented programming, a class derived from another class (called the parent class)." markdown="1">child class</a> to do local archiving

-   Convert functions we have built so far into methods

---

## Refactoring

-   Can then create the specific archiver we want

```py
archiver = ArchiveLocal(source_dir, backup_dir)
```


-   Other code can then use it *without knowing exactly what it's doing*

```py

def analyze_and_save(options, archiver):
    data = read_data(options)
    results = analyze_data(data)
    save_everything(results)
    archiver.backup()
```
