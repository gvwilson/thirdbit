<h1>Finding Duplicate Files</h1>
<div class="bottom">
  <a href="../">chapter</a>
</div>

## Overview

-   We want to find duplicate files, but can't rely on their names

-   Comparing pairs of files byte by byte is slow

    -   And gets slower per file as the number of files grows

-   Better approach:

    -   Calculate an identifier for each file that depends on its content

    -   Group files with the same identifier and compare those

-   Even better: calculate identifiers so that if two files have the same ID, they're guaranteed to have the same content

---

## Start Simple

-   Take filenames as command-line arguments

-   Generate and print a list of duplicate pairs

```py
def find_duplicates(filenames):
    matches = []
    for left in filenames:
        for right in filenames:
            if same_bytes(left, right):
                matches.append((left, right))
    return matches


if __name__ == "__main__":
    duplicates = find_duplicates(sys.argv[1:])
    for (left, right) in duplicates:
        print(left, right)
```


---

## Byte by Byte

```py
def same_bytes(left_name, right_name):
    left_bytes = open(left_name, "rb").read()
    right_bytes = open(right_name, "rb").read()
    return left_bytes == right_bytes
```


-   `open(filename, "r")` opens a file for reading characters

-   But images, audio clips, etc. aren't character data

-   So use <code>open(filename, "r<strong>b</strong>")</code> to open in <a class="gl-ref" href="../../glossary/#gl:binary_mode" title="An option for reading or writing files in which each byte is transferred literally. The term is used in contrast with text mode." markdown="1">binary mode</a>

    -   Look at the difference in more detail in <a class="x-ref" href="../../binary/">Chapter 17</a>

---

## Test Case

-   Create a `tests` directory with six files

| `a1.txt` | `a2.txt` | `a3.txt` | `b1.txt` | `b2.txt` | `c1.txt` |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| aaa | aaa | aaa | bb | bb | c |

-   Expect the three `a` files and the two `b` files to be reported as duplicates

-   No particular reason for these tests—we just have to start somewhere

---

## Test Output

```sh
python brute_force_1.py tests/*.txt
```


```
tests/a1.txt tests/a1.txt
tests/a1.txt tests/a2.txt
tests/a1.txt tests/a3.txt
tests/a2.txt tests/a1.txt
tests/a2.txt tests/a2.txt
tests/a2.txt tests/a3.txt
tests/a3.txt tests/a1.txt
tests/a3.txt tests/a2.txt
tests/a3.txt tests/a3.txt
tests/b1.txt tests/b1.txt
tests/b1.txt tests/b2.txt
tests/b2.txt tests/b1.txt
tests/b2.txt tests/b2.txt
tests/c1.txt tests/c1.txt
```


-   Oops

---

## Revise Our Approach

```py
def find_duplicates(filenames):
    matches = []
    for i_left in range(len(filenames)):
        left = filenames[i_left]
        for i_right in range(i_left):
            right = filenames[i_right]
            if same_bytes(left, right):
                matches.append((left, right))
    return matches
```

## Algorithmic Complexity

-   \\( N \\) objects can be paired in \\( N(N-1)/2 \\) ways

-   So for very large \\( N \\), work is proportional to \\( N^2 \\)

-   Computer scientist would say "<a class="gl-ref" href="../../glossary/#gl:time_complexity" title="The way the running time of an algorithm grows as a function of the problem size, usually expressed using big-oh notation." markdown="1">time complexity</a> is \\( O(N^2) \\)"

    -   Pronounced "<a class="gl-ref" href="../../glossary/#gl:big_oh" title="A way to express how the running time or memory requirements of an algorithm increase as the size of the problem increases." markdown="1">big-oh</a> of N squared"

-   In practice, this means that the time per file increases as the number of files increases

-   Sometimes unavoidable, but in this case there's a better way

---

## Grouping Files

-   Process each file once to produce a short identifier

-   I.e., use a <a class="gl-ref" href="../../glossary/#gl:hash_function" title="A function that turns arbitrary data into a bit array, or a key, of a fixed size. Hash functions are used to determine where data should be stored in a hash table." markdown="1">hash function</a> to produce a <a class="gl-ref" href="../../glossary/#gl:hash_code" title="A value generated by a hash function. Good hash codes have the same properties as random numbers in order to reduce the frequency of collisions." markdown="1">hash code</a>

-   Only compare files with the same identifier

<figure>
<img src="../hash_group.svg" alt="Grouping by hash code"/>
</figure>


---

## Naive Hashing

-   Bytes are just numbers

```py
def naive_hash(data):
    return sum(data) % 13
```


```py
example = bytes("hashing", "utf-8")
for i in range(1, len(example) + 1):
    substring = example[:i]
    hash = naive_hash(substring)
    print(f"{hash:2} {substring}")
```


```
 0 b'h'
 6 b'ha'
 4 b'has'
 4 b'hash'
 5 b'hashi'
11 b'hashin'
10 b'hashing'
```


---

## How Good Is This?

-   Want all hash codes to be equally likely

    -   Large file groups are disproportionately expensive

-   Hash each line of the novel *Dracula* and plot distribution

<figure>
<img src="../naive_dracula.svg" alt="Hash codes of <em>Dracula</em>"/>
</figure>


---

## After a Little Digging…

-   Our text file uses a blank line to separate paragraphs

-   So it's no surprise that 0 is the most common hash code

-   Look at the distribution of hash codes of *unique* lines

<figure>
<img src="../naive_dracula_unique.svg" alt="Hash codes of unique lines of <em>Dracula</em>"/>
</figure>


---

## Modifying Our Program

-   Build a dictionary with hash codes as keys and sets of files as values

```py
def find_groups(filenames):
    groups = {}
    for fn in filenames:
        data = open(fn, "rb").read()
        hash_code = naive_hash(data)
        if hash_code not in groups:
            groups[hash_code] = set()
        groups[hash_code].add(fn)
    return groups
```


-   If we haven't seen this key before, add it with an empty value

---

## Modifying Our Program

-   We can re-use most of the previous code

```py
groups = find_groups(sys.argv[1:])
for filenames in groups.values():
    duplicates = find_duplicates(list(filenames))
    for (left, right) in duplicates:
        print(left, right)
```


```
tests/a2.txt tests/a1.txt
tests/a3.txt tests/a1.txt
tests/a3.txt tests/a2.txt
tests/b1.txt tests/b2.txt
```


---

## But We Can Do Better

-   Use a <a class="gl-ref" href="../../glossary/#gl:cryptographic_hash_function" title="A hash function that produces an apparently-random value for any input." markdown="1">cryptographic hash function</a>

    -   Output is completely deterministic

    -   But also unpredictable

    -   And distributed like a uniform random variable

-   Output depends on *order* of input as well as *value*

    -   With overwhelming probability, any change in input will produce a different output

---

## We Don't Need Groups

-   Odds that two people don't share a birthday are \\( 364/365 \\)

-   Odds that three people don't have are \\( (364/365) {\times} (363/365) \\)

-   There's a 50% chance of two people sharing a birthday in a group of 23 people
    and a 99.9% chance with 70 people

-   How many files do we need to hash before there's a 50% chance of a <a class="gl-ref" href="../../glossary/#gl:hash_collision" title="A situation in which two or more values have the same hash code." markdown="1">collision</a>
    with a 256-bit hash?

-   Answer is "approximately \\( 4{\times}10^{38} \\) files"

-   We're willing to take that risk

---

## SHA-256 Example

```py
example = bytes("hash", "utf-8")
for i in range(1, len(example) + 1):
    substring = example[:i]
    hash = sha256(substring).hexdigest()
    print(f"{substring}\n{hash}")
```


```
b'h'
aaa9402664f1a41f40ebbc52c9993eb66aeb366602958fdfaa283b71e64db123
b'ha'
8693873cd8f8a2d9c7c596477180f851e525f4eaf55a4f637b445cb442a5e340
b'has'
9150c74c5f92d51a92857f4b9678105ba5a676d308339a353b20bd38cd669ce7
b'hash'
d04b98f48e8f8bcc15c6ae5ac050801cd6dcfd428fb5f9e65c4e16e7807340fa
```


-   `hexdigest` gives <a class="gl-ref" href="../../glossary/#gl:hexadecimal" title="A base-16 numerical representation that uses the letters A-F (or a-f) to represent the values from 10 to 15." markdown="1">hexadecimal</a> representation of 256-bit hash code

---

## Duplicate Finder

```py
import sys
from hashlib import sha256

def find_groups(filenames):
    groups = {}
    for fn in filenames:
        data = open(fn, "rb").read()
        hash_code = sha256(data).hexdigest()
        if hash_code not in groups:
            groups[hash_code] = set()
        groups[hash_code].add(fn)
    return groups


if __name__ == "__main__":
    groups = find_groups(sys.argv[1:])
    for filenames in groups.values():
        print(", ".join(sorted(filenames)))
```


---

## Duplicate Finder

```sh
python dup.py tests/*.txt
```


```
tests/a1.txt, tests/a2.txt, tests/a3.txt
tests/b1.txt, tests/b2.txt
tests/c1.txt
```


-   Runtime is \\(O(N)\\), i.e., fixed time per file

-   Which is as good as it can possibly be

---

class: aside

## Learning Debt

-   What else can we use hashing for?

    -   Dictionaries

    -   Version control

-   How can we test our duplicate finder?

-   How can we make sure the code follows style guidelines?

-   How can we package it for others to use?
