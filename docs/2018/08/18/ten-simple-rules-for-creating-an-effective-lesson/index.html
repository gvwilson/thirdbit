<!-- content --><p>I&rsquo;m preparing a couple of talks based on <a href="http://teachtogether.tech"><em>Teaching Tech Together</em></a>,
and this seems like a useful topic to cover.
Updated notes are below;
I&rsquo;d be grateful for <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">feedback by email</a>.
(I&rsquo;ve disabled comments on this site until the trolls find someone else to pester.)</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are many kinds of lessons, formal and informal, from seconds long to lifelong</li>
<li>This guide is about prepared instructional plans and content for half an hour to a day</li>
</ul>
<h3>A Little Bit of Theory</h3>
<ul>
<li>Psychology of learning<ul>
<li>Load short term memory</li>
<li>Keep it there long enough to transfer to long term memory</li>
<li>Create links so that knowledge is retrievable (bigger obstacle than outright retention)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Goal for novices is to build a mental model<ul>
<li>Following a path through a concept map helps ensure connectedness</li>
<li>Naming subgoals help</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cognitive load theory points out that learners are trying to:<ul>
<li>Recall factual knowledge</li>
<li>Choose a solution strategy</li>
<li>Formulate a response</li>
<li>Use tools,</li>
<li>So teach these all separately and synthesize as a lesson in its own right</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While we&rsquo;re here, a few myths:<ul>
<li>Mindset and stereotype threat are probably not as important as initially thought (this is how science progresses)</li>
<li>VAK learning styles</li>
<li>The &ldquo;Pyramid of Learning&rdquo;</li>
<li>And teaching evaluations are suspect, as are self-assessments</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>1. Write Learner Personas to Define Your Audience</h3>
<ul>
<li>A lesson is a user interface for knowledge, so borrow methods from user interface design</li>
<li><em>You are not your learners</em> (expert blind spot)</li>
<li>General background</li>
<li>What they already know</li>
<li>What they think they want to know</li>
<li>What they actually need to know in order to achieve their aims (which may be different from what they think)</li>
<li>Special considerations (e.g., accessibility, child care)</li>
<li>How the lesson will help them achieve their aims</li>
<li>First four parts are usually shared across multiple lessons and instructors</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Write Summative Assessments to Set Concrete Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Understand linear regression&rdquo; is vague; a specific exercise makes aim much clearer</li>
<li>Also helps communicate value of lesson to learners</li>
<li>Derive learning objectives from what learners will do to demonstrate knowledge</li>
<li>Remember, &ldquo;understand X&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t checkable</li>
<li>Draw a concept map!</li>
<li>This series should be &ldquo;7 plus or minus 2 Rules&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Write Formative Assessments for Pacing, Design, Preparation, and Reinforcement</h3>
<ul>
<li>Spend 1-2 minutes checking in with learners via formative assessment every 10-15 minutes</li>
<li>Pacing: are they still with you?</li>
<li>Design: they act as milestones building toward the summative assessment</li>
<li>Preparation: everything in the summative assessment should be exercised by a formative assessment</li>
<li>Reinforcement: learners remember more if they use material right away (problem isn&rsquo;t forgetting, but access)</li>
<li>Doing this almost always tell you that you&rsquo;re trying to cover too much</li>
<li>Makes prerequisites explicit<ul>
<li>Enumerating prerequisite knowledge and skills helps you overcome expert blind spot</li>
<li>And helps stitch lessons together</li>
<li>Be careful not to intimidate learners who have impostor syndrome</li>
<li>As with summative assessment, works best when concrete</li>
<li>Not &ldquo;understand linear regression&rdquo;, but &ldquo;can do the following&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Be Inclusive</h3>
<ul>
<li>Choice of language or examples will tell people whether or not they&rsquo;re welcome and likely to be taken seriously</li>
<li>(If you don&rsquo;t already know this, you&rsquo;re probably a member of a privileged group)</li>
<li>Do not use a deficit model (&ldquo;they&rdquo; are missing something, &ldquo;they&rdquo; need to try harder)</li>
<li>For example, Lach2018 explored two strategies:<ul>
<li>Community representation: highlights students&rsquo; social identities,
    histories, and community networks using after-school mentors or role
    models from students&rsquo; neighborhoods, or activities that use
    community narratives and histories as a foundation for a computing
    project.  Major risk is shallowness, e.g., using computers to build
    slideshows rather than do any real computing.</li>
<li>Computational integration: incorporates ideas from the learner&rsquo;s
    community, e.g., reverse engineering indigenous graphic designs in a
    visual programming environment.  Major risk is cultural appropriation,
    e.g., using practices without acknowledging origins.</li>
<li>When in doubt, ask your learners and members of their community what
    they think you ought to do and give them control over content and
    direction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DiSa2014a demonstrates effectiveness</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Eliminate Incentives for Cheating</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cheating is usually not a symptom of moral failing, but a rational response to poorly-designed incentives<ul>
<li>Beck2014 found that cheating is no more likely online than in person</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Motivation and demotivation in adult learners<ul>
<li>Motivators: agency, utility, communality</li>
<li>Demotivators: unpredictability, unfairness, indifference</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Examples from Lang2013:<ul>
<li>Set the cost of failure very high</li>
<li>Rely on single assessment mechanisms like multiple-choice tests</li>
<li>Arbitrary grading criteria</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Use Concreteness Fading</h3>
<ul>
<li>PETE (Problem, Explanation, Theory, Example) goes from specific and tangible to more abstract</li>
<li>What is the authentic problem that the lesson solves next?</li>
<li>Explain a concrete solution</li>
<li>Fill in the underlying theory</li>
<li>Provide a second example so that learners will understand which parts generalize</li>
<li>Authentic problem may be an end goal, or in later lessons, may arise out of a previous solution</li>
<li>Build a usable mental model so that learners have somewhere to put knowledge, then correct the model as necessary</li>
<li>E.g., ball-and-spring model in chemistry, evolution solely by descent, CPU-memory-disk model in computing</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Design for Peer Instruction</h3>
<ul>
<li>Scalable approximation of individual tutoring that engages learners<ol>
<li>Students do pre-class reading</li>
<li>Instructor poses question</li>
<li>Students vote publicly</li>
<li>Students discuss reasoning with each other</li>
<li>Students re-vote</li>
<li>Instructor reviews</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Crou2001 and Port2016 are just two examples of studies showing its effectiveness</li>
<li>In practice, often do some instruction in class, but always leading to peer discussion as quickly as possible</li>
<li>E.g., type and run a few lines of code, then ask &ldquo;what happens if I add X?&rdquo; or &ldquo;what line do I add to achieve Y?&rdquo;<ul>
<li>Thanks to Mark Guzdial for this example</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>The Discussion Book</em> has many other methods (e.g., think-pair-share)</li>
</ul>
<h3>8. Design Around Worked Examples</h3>
<ul>
<li>Learners learn faster from worked examples than they do from solving problems on their own<ul>
<li>They eventually need to do the latter, but step-by-step explanation of why and how helps more</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Live performances (music, programming, theorem proof) are effectively worked examples<ul>
<li>The &ldquo;PEE&rdquo; in &ldquo;PETE&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>9. Show How to Detect, Diagnose, and Correct Common Mistakes</h3>
<ul>
<li>One aspect of worked examples that&rsquo;s important enough to deserve its own section</li>
<li>Novices spend much of their time making mistakes and trying to fix them, because they&rsquo;re novices</li>
<li>Including DD&amp;C in the lesson reduces frustration, which in turn accelerates learning</li>
<li>Also helps solidify their mental model</li>
</ul>
<h3>10. Foster Collaboration with Other Instructors</h3>
<ul>
<li>DiSa2014b shows that lessons are often not findable</li>
<li>FAIR Principles for data (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) also apply to lessons<ul>
<li>But &ldquo;reusable&rdquo; is aiming low</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Instead of one author broadcasting for others to use, foster collaboration in a teaching commons<ul>
<li>Open source software and Wikipedia demonstrate the benefits</li>
<li>Increases inclusivity and reduces lesson maintenance burden</li>
<li>And it&rsquo;s more fun</li>
</ul>
</li>
