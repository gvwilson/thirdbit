<p>Following on from <a href="../../../../2018/12/12/twelve-percent/">previous</a>
<a href="../../../../2018/12/17/thirteen-percent/">posts</a>
about sharing lessons
(which were actually more about discoverability),
this post is yet another re-think,
and is based in part on a conversation with <a href="https://francoismichonneau.net/">François Michonneau</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear at this point that
    most people aren&rsquo;t going to teach someone else&rsquo;s lesson exactly as written,
    but are instead going to adapt it for their audience
    and splice in material of their own.
    They might keep the explanations but use a different data set,
    replace exercises with ones they&rsquo;ve written themselves,
    reverse the order of a few lectures,
    or remove some chunks entirely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I believe adapters will be able to do this faster and better
    if they understand why a lesson was written the way it was,
    but that knowledge is usually unwritten.
    The Carpentries lesson on the Unix shell
    embodies a lot of experience
    with topics and orders and examples that <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> work,
    or worked less well than what&rsquo;s in there now.
    If someone picks it up and starts making changes,
    there&rsquo;s a good chance they&rsquo;ll repeat mistakes we made and learned from years ago,
    or break a dependency without realizing it until they&rsquo;re in front of a class
    (because there&rsquo;s no equivalent of regression tests for lesson content).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So what if we didn&rsquo;t share just the lesson (for some value of &ldquo;just&rdquo;)?
    And what if we didn&rsquo;t share it as if people were going to re-use it as is?
    What if the unit of sharing was <em>a description of how to build a lesson</em> that met some need?
    More specifically,
    what if what we shared described the thought process used to create a lesson on topic X,
    with one such lesson as a worked example?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As it happens,
    we already teach people <a href="http://teachtogether.tech/en/process/">a systematic lesson design process</a>
    that produces most of this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write or recycle learner personas to figure out who you&rsquo;re trying to help
    what <em>they</em> think they want to learn,
and how you&rsquo;re going to help them.</li>
<li>Brainstorm (e.g., draw a concept map or two).</li>
<li>Write the summative assessment(s) that will tell you and your learners if the lesson worked.</li>
<li>Write the formative assessments that will tell you and them if they&rsquo;re on track.</li>
<li>Order those.</li>
<li>Write the bits of lesson that connect them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What we <em>don&rsquo;t</em> do is capture that information, but we could.
    While some of the instructors I was working with eight months ago
    pushed back against designing a lesson in such a structured way,
    having those design docs would make it much easier for someone to figure out
    where their needs or tastes differed from those of the original author,
    which I think would help them make changes more quickly and more accurately.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The downside, of course, is that this would require more work from the original author.
However, I think that work pays off pretty quickly:
I&rsquo;m certainly building materials better and faster now that I&rsquo;ve got a process,
though I admit that could be due to practice effects rather than the method I&rsquo;m using.
As a next step,
I&rsquo;d like to know if anyone has ever studied the impact that lesson design documentation has on lesson uptake and adaption.
If you know of anything along these lines,
