<!-- content --><p>After reading &ldquo;<a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/questions-to-ask-in-a-job-interview.html">10 Impressive Questions to Ask in a Job Interview</a>&rdquo;
back in November,
I tweeted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Questions they left out:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Has anyone currently with the company ever assaulted, harassed, or discriminated against a fellow employee?
If so, are they still with the company? If so, what steps <em>were</em> taken?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the company or any of its direct customers provide material support (e.g. hosting or other services) for hate groups?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the demographic breakdown (age, gender, ethnicity, etc.) of current employees by level?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking some more about the first two of these,
and about whether some kind of harassment canary might be useful.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a harassment canary?
Well, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary">warrant canary</a>
is a way for a company to let people know it has been served with a subpoena
that it&rsquo;s not allowed to talk about.
In its simplest form,
the company posts a notice every day or week saying,
&ldquo;We have <em>not</em> been served with a secret warrant in the last N days.&rdquo;
Any time the notice doesn&rsquo;t appear is a very significant silence,
like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_Silver_Blaze">the dog that didn&rsquo;t bark in the night</a>.</p>
<p>By analogy,
a harassment canary is something regularly published on a company&rsquo;s website that says something like,
&ldquo;There have been no reported incidents of assault, harassment, or discrimination in this company in the past 30 days.&rdquo;
Since zero tolerance is a more achievable goal in the short term than zero incidence,
it could be expanded to say,
&ldquo;…or if there have, those found responsible have been fired
or have been penalized in the following ways,&rdquo;
along with a detailed list of steps taken
(so that senior executives aren&rsquo;t let off with a slap on the wrist).</p>
<p>I think that something like this could be useful in several ways.
As someone interviewing with the company,
for example,
the absence of such a statement
or a gap in its publication
would tell me a whole lot more about the company&rsquo;s culture
than any number of frothy statements about commitment to excellence.
Similarly,
a non-profit organization trying to decide whose donations to accept
would be able to steer clear of companies whose behavior they might not want to be associated with.</p>
<p>There are undoubtedly ethical and legal considerations here that I haven&rsquo;t thought of.
If you can spot the flaws,
I&rsquo;d enjoy hearing from you <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">by email</a>
or in the comments on this post.</p><!-- /content -->
