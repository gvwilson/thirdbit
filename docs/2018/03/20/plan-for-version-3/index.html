<!-- content --><p>I am planning a major revision of
<em>How to Teach Programming (and Other Things)</em>,
and would be very grateful for feedback on its design:
please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">mail me</a>
your thoughts and suggestions.
Note that this design follows the five-step backward design process
laid out in the book itself.</p>
<h2>Brainstorming</h2>
<p><em>These questions and answers provide a rough scope for the material.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What problems will learners learn how to solve?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How people learn and what that tells us about how best to teach
    them (educational psychology, cognitive load, study skills).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to design and deliver instruction in computing skills
    (backward curriculum design, some pedagogical content knowledge
    for computing).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to deliver lessons (teaching as a performance art, live
    coding, motivation and demotivation, and automation).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to grow a teaching community (community organization and
    marketing).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is out of scope?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How to teach children or people with special learning needs.
    Much of what&rsquo;s in this material applies to those learners, but
    they have different or extra needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to rigorously assess the impact of training. Informal
    self-assessment will be included, but we will not try to explain
    how to do publishable scientific research in education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to design and deliver entire degree programs and other
    extended curriculum. Again, much of what&rsquo;s in this material
    applies, but the extra needs of large-scale curriculum design is
    out of scope.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>What concepts and techniques will learners encounter?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>7±2 and chunking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authentic tasks with tangible artifacts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bloom&rsquo;s Taxonomy, Fink&rsquo;s Taxonomy, and Piaget&rsquo;s development
    stage theory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Branding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cognitive development from novice to competent to expert.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cognitive load.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaborative lesson development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concept mapping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Designing assessments with diagnostic power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dunning-Kruger effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expert blind spot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Externalized cognition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed vs. growth mindset (and critiques of it).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formative vs. summative assesment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Governance models of community organizations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inquiry-based learning (and critiques of it).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Jugyokenkyu</em> (lesson study).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learner personas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Legitimate peripheral participation in a community of practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Live coding (teaching as a performance art).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and technological pedagogical
    and content knowledge (TPACK).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peer instruction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflective (deliberate) practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backward design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stereotype threat (and critiques of it).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working memory vs. persistent memory.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>What mistakes or misconceptions will they have?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Children and adults learn the same way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Computing education should be for and about computer science.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Programming skill is innate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Student evaluations of courses are indicative of learning
    outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teaching ability is innate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The best way to teach is to throw people in at the deep end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The best way to teach is to use “real” tools right from the
    start.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visual-auditory-kinesthetic (VAK) learning styles are real.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Women just don&rsquo;t like programming or innately have less
    aptitude.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Getting a (better) job is the main reason someone should learn
    how to program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Programming ability correlates with mathematical ability (or
    musical ability, or…)</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In what contexts will this material be used?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Primary: an intensive weekend workshop for people in tech who
    want to volunteer with grassroots get-into-coding initiatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondary: self-study or guided study by such people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondary: a one-semester undergraduate course for computer
    science majors interested in education.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Intended Audience</h2>
<p><em>These learner personas clarify what readers are interested in and what
can be assumed about their prior knowledge.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Samira</em> is an undergraduate in robotics who is thinking about
    becoming a full-time teacher after she graduates. She wants to help
    teach weekend workshops for undergraduate women, but has never
    taught an entire class before, and feels uncomfortable teaching
    things that she&rsquo;s not an expert in. She wants to learn more about
    education in general in order to decide if it&rsquo;s for her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Moshe</em> is a professional programmer with two teenage children whose
    school doesn&rsquo;t offering programming classes. He has volunteered to
    run an after-school program, and while he frequently gives
    presentations to colleagues, he has no experience designing lessons.
    He sants to learn how to build effective lessons in collaboration
    with others, and is interested in turning his lessons into a
    self-paced online course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Emily</em> trained as a librarian, and how works as a web designer and
    project manager in a small consulting company. In her spare time,
    she helps run web design classes for women entering tech as a second
    career. She is now recruiting colleagues to run more classes in her
    area using the lessons that she has created, and wants to know how
    to grow a volunteer teaching organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Gene</em> is a professor of computer science at a research-intensive
    university whose research area is operating systems for embedded
    devices.  They have been teaching undergraduate classes for six
    years, and increasingly believe that there has to be a better
    way. The only training available through their university&rsquo;s
    teaching and learning center relates to posting assignments and
    grades in the learning management system, so they want to find out
    what else they ought to be asking for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Common elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A variety of technical backgrounds and skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May or may not have some teaching experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No formal training in teaching, lesson design, or community
    organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teaching in free-range settings at least as often as in
    institutional classrooms (with required homework, final
    exams, and externally-mandated curricula).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focused on teenagers and adults rather children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limited time and resources (either because they are volunteers,
    or because their institution considers teaching a secondary
    responsibility).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diverse learning contexts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Moshe will do a two-day weekend workshop covering much less
    material and then study on his own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emily will study on her own while leading an online reading
    group for her volunteers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Samira will take a one-semester undergraduate course with
    assignments, a project, and a final exam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gene will study on their own like Emily or take an intensive
    workshop like Moshe.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Exercises</h2>

with their new knowledge. The finished book will include others as
well.</em></p>

<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<h3>Brief Description</h3>
<p>Teaching isn&rsquo;t magic: good teachers are simply people who have learned
how to design lessons to achieve concrete goals, how to get and use
feedback from learners, and how to work well with other teachers. This
book will show you how to do these things and more, and will introduce
you to some of the research that explains why some things work and some
things don&rsquo;t. It is primarily intended for people in tech with no formal
training in teaching who want to help adults learn how to create web
sites, write programs, and analyze data, but the ideas apply equally
well to other groups in other settings.</p>
<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>Learners will be able to…</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Explain the cognitive changes that occur as people go from novice to
    competent to expert and how best to teach each group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain how to design, construct, and maintain lessons in a
    systematic, collaborative way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design exercises to help correct key misconceptions that learners
    have about computing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Summarize key elements of pedagogical content knowledge related to
    computing and other technical skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare and contrast teaching with other performance arts and
    participate in structured critiques of live teaching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare and contrast interactive teaching, automated teaching, and
    hybrid models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe factors that motivate or demotivate adult learners and how
    to take those into account when teaching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe ways in which members of different groups are made to feel
    unwelcome or excluded in computing and what can be done to make
    computing more inclusive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain the purpose and value of their teaching and of their
    community of practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be a productive member of a community of teaching practice.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Some exercises will assume a small amount of programming knowledge:
readers should know how to loop over the elements of a list, how to
read or write an if-else statement, and how to write a simple
function.</p><!-- /content -->
