    for academic-industry research partnerships</a>.
  </em>
</p>

<p>
  Half a century ago, C.P. Snow decried the gulf between the two
  cultures of science and humanities; today, there is just as great a
  divide between researchers and practitioners in education.  This is
  particularly frustrating to those of us who work in free-range
  settings such as grassroots get-into-coding initiatives, since we
  would be able to adopt new ideas more quickly than teachers in
  institutional settings, if only we knew what to adopt.  I hope these
  ten simple rules will help to bridge this gulf, or at least mitigate
  the frustration it creates.
</p>

<h2>If You Do Education Research</h2>

<h3>1. Remember that teachers have to teach.</h3>

<p>
  In the time it takes a researcher to write a grant proposal, most
  teachers have to deliver dozens of lessons.  They cannot simply put
  students on hold (as much as they may sometimes want to), and they
  cannot give your work more than a few scattered hours of attention.
  Discuss timescales and time loads with your in-school partners
  early, and be understanding about both.
</p>

<h3>2. Ask, then tell.</h3>

<p>
  One of the fundamental rules of teaching is, "You are not your
  learners."  If you are a researcher, it is just as important for you
  to remember that you are not like your research subjects.  Before
  you design a study or begin a round of interviews, take some time to
  get to know the teachers and students you will be working with, to
  find out what their actual problems are, and to learn what they
  would consider a solution.
</p>

<h3>3. Value action over insight.</h3>

<p>
  Most teachers' goal is not to understand the world, but to change
  it, so "we know X" is much less useful to them than "we can do Y".
  When presenting your findings, you should therefore focus on how
  someone might act on it.  One way to do this is to add slides
  titled, "What Difference Does It Make?"  at strategic points in your
  presentations.  If you can't think of what to put on them, you may
  want to rethink the focus of your research.
</p>

<p>
  Equally, understanding doesn't have to be complete in order to be
  actionable.  You may need to hedge conclusions with qualifiers in
  order to get your work past Reviewer #3, but those "maybes" and
  "howevers" can and should be omitted if they don't change what
  teachers should try next.  When in doubt, never hesitate to
  sacrifice detail for clarity.
</p>

<h3>4. Publish in open-access venues.</h3>

<p>
  Research is of no use to teachers who cannot easily find it and read
  it.  "Easily" is the key word here: Jimmy Wales may never actually
  have said, "Open information drives out closed," but with so much
  freely available on the Internet, any paywall or login barrier put
  between you and your hoped-for audience will send most people
  elsewhere.  More importantly, these barriers send a clear signal
  that you do not care if practitioners read your work or not.
</p>

<h2>If You Are a Teacher</h2>

<h3>5. Remember that researchers have to publish.</h3>

<p>
  Researchers are not given grants or tenure for doing things that are
  "merely useful"; they are rewarded and promoted for publishing,
  publishing, and publishing.  For all the jokes practitioners make
  about the ivory tower, academic life is hard, uncertain, and poorly
  paid.  People do it for the love of new knowledge; respect their
  priorities, and try to be understanding about their arcane rituals.
</p>

<h3>6. Remember that researchers have to do many other things as well.</h3>

<p>
  Academic researchers are almost always multi-tasking, and many of
  those tasks are things they've never been trained to do.  As
  students, they juggle several courses at once (which effectively
  means that they answer to several bosses who don't communicate with
  each other).  Later, they are responsible for teaching, writing
  grant proposals, and administrative duties.  Collectively, this mean
  that their "work week" is only a few hours long, and that they will
  often appear to move at a snail's pace.  Be as sympathetic as you
  can–they are even less happy with the situation than you are.
</p>

<h3>7. Do your reading.</h3>

<p>
  H.L. Mencken wrote, "There is always a well-known solution to every
  human problem—neat, plausible, and wrong."  Your problem is almost
  certainly one of those, and is almost certainly more complex than
  you first realize.  While researchers should sacrifice detail for
  clarity, you should make an effort to grasp at least some of that
  detail so that you don't waste time reinventing wheels and so that
  your research partner can think, work, and talk at full speed.
</p>

<h3>8. Don't overstate what has been learned.</h3>

<p>
  The "maybes" and "howevers" that researchers are so fond of do
  sometimes matter; if your research partner has found that spaced
  practice in athletics seems to reduce the amount of peer aggression
  in adolescents, do not embarrass them by claiming that they have
  discovered a cure for bullying.
</p>

<h2>For Both</h2>

<h3>9. Apologize in advance for the state of your data.</h3>

<p>
  Files' names and locations, the meanings of column headers in
  tables, how those tables relate to one another, how missing values
  are represented and handles: everything that has made sense to you
  for years will suddenly seem a little foolish when you have to
  explain it to someone else.  Apologize in advance, and then forgive
  yourself, because no matter how bad your data is, theirs may well be
  worse.
</p>

<h3>10. Apologize in advance for your institution's rules.</h3>

<p>
  Individual schools and universities may be small, but both are
  always part of something larger, and as James Scott pointed out
  in <em>Seeing Like a State</em>, large institutions always favor
  uniformity over productivity.  There will inevitably be times when
  you and your collaborators know what the right thing to do is, and
  aren't allowed to do it.  Take a deep breath, re-watch Terry
  Gilliam's <em>Brazil</em>, and remind yourself that this too shall
  pass.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
  An old proverb says, "If you want to go fast, go alone.  If you want
  to go far, go together."  Teachers and researchers can each do great
  things on their own, but both are better able to solve big
  problems–problems that really matter–if they find ways to work
  together.
