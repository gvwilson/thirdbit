<!-- content --><p>I never got more than a couple of dozen pages into Sandberg&rsquo;s <em>Lean In</em>,
but I&rsquo;ve just finished Williams and Dempsey&rsquo;s
<em><a href="https://isbndb.com/book/9781479872664">What Works for Women at Work</a></em>
and loved it.
Drawing on a ton of research and interviews,
they put forward four concrete patterns,
quoted below:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Prove-It-Again!</em> is exactly what it sounds like:
    women have to prove themselves over and over again much more so than men
    in order to be seen as equally competent.
    Prove-It-Again! is  <em>descriptive</em> bias that stems from assumptions about the typical woman.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>Tightrope</em> is <em>prescriptive</em> bias, which stems from assumptions about how women <em>should</em> behave.
    The Tightrope describes a double bind:
    women often find that if they behave in traditionally feminine ways,
    they exacerbate Prove-It-Again! problems;
    but if they behave in traditionally masculine ways,
    they are seen as lacking social skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>Maternal Wall</em> consists of both <em>descriptive bias</em>,
    in the form of strong negative competence and commitment assumptions triggered by motherhood,
    and <em>presctive bias</em>â€”disapproval on the grounds that mothers should be at home or working fewer hours.
    Women with children are routinely pushed to the margins of the professional world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>Tug of War</em> occurs as each women tries to navigate her own path between assimilating into masculine traditions and resisting them.
    Women&rsquo;s different strategies divide them.
    Some women are tomboys, who just need access:
    all they want to do is to play the game as the boys play it.
    Other women want to preserve more of the traditions of femininity.
    Women&rsquo;s different strategies often pit them against each other,
    as do workplaces that communicate that there&rsquo;s room for only one woman.
    All of these pressures often lead women to judge each other on what&rsquo;s the right way to be a woman.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If I ever teach an undergrad software engineering course again,
this is going to be required reading.
I don&rsquo;t expect it will be news to the women in the class
(though it might give them terminology for their lived experience),
but I hope it will help men like my younger self to realize what they&rsquo;re doing wrong
and how it&rsquo;s harmful.</p><!-- /content -->
