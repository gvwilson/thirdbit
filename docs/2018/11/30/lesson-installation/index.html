<!-- content --><p>I asked this question on Twitter last night:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there a widely-used packaging format for distributing lesson and exercise files to students?
Like R packages for R, eggs or wheels for Python, gems for Ruby, etc.?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In more detail, this is the problem I&rsquo;m trying to solve:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In order to do a programming assignment,
    a learner may want to get several files on her machine,
    including the assignment description, starter code, and some data sets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to get these to her,
    an instructor can create a zip file (or other archive)
    that unpacks to be a directory containing the required files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternatively,
    the instructor can create a version control repository containing the required materials,
    and the student can clone that repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But every modern language has a way to create and distribute software and related files,
    such as packages in R, eggs or wheels in Python, or gems in Ruby,
    so a third option is for the instructor to create a package for learners to install.
    (A lesson package would just have a higher documentation-to-code ratio than usual…)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distributing exercises as packages appeals because it would leverage existing tools
    to handle dependencies.
    Need a particular library to do exercise 3?
    No problem: installing the exercise automatically installs the library.
    The assignment consists of four exercises,
    or several exercises share a large data set:
    Also not a problem:
    installing the assignment triggers installation of the exercises,
    and gives you just one copy of the data set (because that&rsquo;s what package managers are for).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Some technically sophisticated respondents felt that Git is the best way to get files onto learners&rsquo; machines.
However, &ldquo;sophisticated&rdquo; rules out a lot of potential users:
one instructor made it very clear that
if our distribution mechanism requires people to learn Git before they do the first exercise in a stats class,
they&rsquo;ll choose a different distribution mechanism.
(One repository per exercise also seems like the wrong granularity,
but I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;d get used to it.)</p>
<p>Another reader pointed out
that people don&rsquo;t have to be able to use Git in order to get files from GitHub:
they can download the contents of a repository as a zip file.
That solves the multi-file/novice-friendly issues,
but not the dependency/shared file issues.</p>
<p>And these three mechanisms are all ways to get files onto the learner&rsquo;s computer,
but don&rsquo;t specify what those files should contain.
For example,
they don&rsquo;t specify where the local description of the exercise&rsquo;s goals should be
(<code>README.md</code>, maybe?)
where pre-submission unit tests should go,
etc.</p>
<p>A few related points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A growing number of learners are going to work in the cloud rather than on their desktop,
    but that just defers the problem:
    someone has to get the lesson into the cloud resource.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One reader suggested distributing exercises as Jupyter notebooks,
    but a notebook can&rsquo;t include half a dozen data sets and other files.
    (Well, they <em>can</em> if those data sets are embedded as code,
    but 30,000 records don&rsquo;t belong in a notebook.)
    Whatever solution we come up with should allow people to include Jupyter notebooks,
    R Markdown files, and other executable documents,
    but must allow inclusion of other material as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One reader pointed me at <a href="https://scorm.com/scorm-explained/">SCORM</a>,
    but it specifies how instructors can package things up for inclusion in an LMS,
    rather than for distribution to students&rsquo; machines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was surprised to discover that there still isn&rsquo;t a standard machine-readable format for course syllabi:
    the <a href="http://opensyllabusproject.org/">Open Syllabus Project</a> is collecting syllabi for research purposes,
    but other than a couple of one-off efforts,
    there doesn&rsquo;t yet seem to be a widely-used YAML or Markdown layout for describing courses or exercises.
    (Again, SCORM is LMS-facing, not learner-facing.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably over-thinking this—I tend to do that—but <code>install.packages("stats454-ex3")</code> really appeals to me:
it uses existing infrastructure to share things,
and it gives learners practice in managing their machine the way we want them to.
And as a growing number of people adopt semi-formal standards for the structure of their GitHub repositories
(general notes in <code>README.md</code>, license in <code>LICENSE.md</code>, code of conduct in <code>CONDUCT.md</code>,
a <code>CITATION.md</code> to tell people how to cite the work,
documentation in a <code>docs</code> folder, etc.),
it doesn&rsquo;t seem crazy to hope for <code>INSTRUCTIONS.md</code> or the like
with a few keywords in a YAML header
to make lessons and exercises easier to find, share, and do.
If this already exists and I&rsquo;m just looking in the wrong place,
please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">let me know</a>.</p>
