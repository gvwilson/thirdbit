---

He walked straight into my mother's camp one morning in the spring.
My grandfather said that
anyone without enough courtesy to sit at a polite distance and wait for an invitation
should be turned away,
but my mother made him welcome.

She almost changed her mind when he pulled back the hood on his parka.
His hair and beard were red,
and his nose looked like a puffin's beak.

He smiled and said something in a strange language,
then laughed when we replied in our own.
By the summer he and I were learning to wrestle spirits together.
That is how Harald's Saknus came to the Nukiliyorongbo.

---

Berend's Luft pulls the door closed behind him
and stomps down three stairs made from salvaged shipboards.
The shack's single sunken room is lit by a dayglass lantern
and smells of damp wool and salted leather.

"I said three, I meant three."
The trader settles back on her stool and nods a curt hello
as Luft crosses the packed earth floor to the pit stove
and takes off his mittens.

The Nukilbo puts the knife back on the counter and shoulders his pack.
"One blue rabbit fur is enough for a pair of such knives."
He pulls the hood of his parka over his long dark hair
and leaves without saying farewell.

"Stupid sealfuckers,"
the trader says without rancor after he is gone.
"Can't haggle worth maggots."

Luft rubs his hands together.
Even with woolen gloves under his mitts,
his fingers have gone cold.
"I take it you don't like our round-faced friends?"

The trader takes in his crumpled nose,
the beaded braids in his dirty blond beard,
and the sword belted around the parka
that is a size too large for his small frame.
*A good luck charm,*
she thinks.
*If he buys anything, it'll be charm.*
"Oh,
they're all right,"
she says aloud,
taking a small wooden box from the shelf behind her
and setting it on the plank counter between them.
"These three years gone, when ice locked the harbour early?
We'd have most of us starved if Walker and his folk hadn't helped us out."

"Walker? The local chief?"

"Eh, that was him just here."
The trader gestures toward the door
with the misshapen piece of ivory she has taken out of the box.
It is no more magical than a lump of snot,
but as her mother used to say,
start low and then show them something better.
"Comes into town every couple of months with the best furs anyone's ever seen,
or a rack of antlers wider than you can spread your arms.
The rest of 'em think he's---hoy, what's the rush?"

Luft takes the stairs two at a time.
The door bangs closed.
The trader sighs.
She really does miss proper haggling...

---

Arga's Torvane is halfway through her third beer
when someone calls her name.
She squints through the smoke in the belly of the alehouse
and waves at the two men approaching her.

"Hoy," she bellows.
People sometimes think she is partly deaf
or has to shout all the time as a spell price.
In truth,
she is just a loud person.
"Who's your friend?"

Luft slides onto the bench beside her.
"This is Walker," he says,
nodding at the impassive man he has brought with him.

Torvane pries Luft's hand off her arm.
"Can't drink when you do that," she chides.
"Sit, Walker, please.
Karol!
Karol, more here!"

"No thank you," Walker says quietly,
seating himself across from them.
He looks at the table,
at Torvane's glass,
sidelong at the drinkers beside him---everywhere but at Torvane and Luft's faces.

"No?
Well, more for me, eh?"
Torvane takes the mug the aleman hands her,
then a second as Luft takes the first from her.
"Folk here say you know the way up into the Bentfathers, is that right?"

The Nukilbo nods.
Torvane half-stifles a belch.
"Good, that's good.
Luft and I want to get there and back before the harbor freezes.
That gives us, what, two weeks, maybe three?
Just into the foothills, that's all."

"You will find better furs to starboard,"
Walker comments neutrally after a moment.
He wears sternward-style gloves rather than Nukilbo mitts,
Torvane notices.
The sinew stitches along their seams are carefully knotted,
and small blue diamonds have been embroidered around the cuffs for luck.

"We're not after furs,"
Luft says.

Torvane nudges her partner's knee with hers under the table.
"Ten crowns for the trip, half now and half when we're back.
Luft and I already have a sled and some camels---we can leave tomorrow."

The three are silent,
the two en-Ruuda looking at the Nukilbo,
who still does not meet their eyes.
Finally Luft snorts.
"Well,
if you're not hard for it,
do you know someone who would be?"
He drains his mug and lets it thump onto the table.

Walker waits another dozen heartbeats
before raising his eyes to Torvane's.
"Tomorrow at the starboard gate," he agrees.

The en-Ruuda smiles widely.
"Good! At first light?"

Walker nods and stands.
As he lifts his pack to his shoulder
someone pushes him from behind and demands,
"What you do here?"

Walker turns his head.
A heavyset Nukilbo wearing a parka embroidered with the trading company's colors
stands unsteadily a few steps behind him.
"*Pauetsitgualuk*!
You go back the cold.
Nobody want you here!"
He spits on the floor.

Walker shifts his pack on his shoulder and turns as if to go.
The larger Nukilbo shoves him again---or tries to.
Somehow Walker's hand is there to grab his sleeve.
He tugs and turns,
his leg in just the right place to take his assailant's balance away.
The other man lands on the floor with a thud.

Someone whoops.
Someone else shouts, "Twenty crowns on Goose!"
The aleman takes his cudgel from its resting place behind the bar but says nothing.
People always drink more after a fight,
and nothing in the alehouse is breakable except the patrons.

Torvane is on her feet.
"Are you all right?" she asks.

The Nukilbo looks from her to Goose and back,
his lack of expression saying more loudly than words
that *he* is not the one lying on the floor.
"Tomorrow at the starboard gate," he repeats.

Torvane settles back on the bench.
"Knows how to handle himself," she observes.

Her partner scowls.
"Won't be a problem."

"Hm."
She used to find his endless need to prove himself endearing,
but lately---

Goose rolls over onto his feet and launches himself at Walker,
a steel knife in his hand.
Without thinking,
Torvane *reaches* across the room.
The air ripples.
For a moment everyone in the alehouse tastes ginger and regret.
The Nukilbo trips over nothing and falls heavily to the floor once again.

The aleman hefts his cudgel and mutters a curse.
Others make signs with their fingers
or reach for charms tucked under the coats and sweaters.
Walker looks from the Goose to Arga's Torvane,
his face as expressionless as ever,
then walks out into the dim glow of the arctic evening.

"What the hell did you do that for?" Luft hisses.

"Sorry," Torvane sighs.
"I just---old habits."
She scrunches her toes inside her boot and winces
as the toenail that the spell just cost her catches in the thick wool of her sock.
It will come off by morning.
She drains the last of her beer and stands,
conscious of the people who are and aren't looking at her.
"Let's go pack up."

---

*"So the woman has power.
Good.
And the other one?"*

*"I do not know.
He is no bigger than I was at twelve summers."*

*"A knife does not have to be big to be deadly."
The night is a dark shell
flecked with stars like chips of ice.
A camel grumbles somewhere in the distance.
Another answers it.*

*There is a moment's silence.
"Must I go with them?
Laughs-at-Storms is sewing a new blanket.
She says it will be very soft."*

*"It will only be a few days.
You can put your arrows in Laugher's quiver when you return."
The camel bleats again.*

---

Saknus and I spent four years learning how to wrestle.
We trapped small birds and field mice,
then used their bones to command their spirits to do small tricks
before setting them free.
Once I persuaded my brother to trap a lynx for us.
We called its spirit back again and again until my mother found out.
She beat me and my brother for doing it,
but the only punishment for Saknus was a week without lessons.

At night he told us stories of his home in the stern,
of ships and kings and libraries
and cities with so many people
that no one knew all their names.
He laughed at his mistakes as he learned our language,
but brushed off questions about his family or his past.

My grandfather sometimes grumbled that
there was no point teaching someone with no ancestors how to wrestle,
but my mother ignored him.
His stories made the long nights fly by,
and his presence added to our family's prestige.
Other shamans came to meet her strange pupil,
and Saknus learned a little more from each of them.

"A shaman needs strong spirits to work strong magic.
We must wrestle with them to make them obey us.
Only in this way can magic be done."
Saknus smiled whenever my mother said this
as though at a joke only he had heard.

"Can you only call your own ancestors back?" he asked.

"Yes," my mother replied,
and it was true.
I had tried to reach other shamans' ancestors through their necklaces-of-bones,
but I never could.

When my grandfather went to the Summer Lands we fasted for two days,
then cut off his thumbs and burned his body.
My mother emptied the stew-pot and boiled the thumbs
until the meat fell from them.

She took the bones and went away from camp.
"A spirit fights hardest the first time it is called back,"
I told Saknus,
proud of knowing something he did not.
"Once he submits,
she will put his bones on her necklace."

"It already has a great many,"
he observed.

"Twenty-two," I told him proudly.
"Every summer my mother makes a magic to tie her spirit to her own bones
so that after she dies I can call her back and wrestle her.
Every shaman does this for the sake of those who come after.
If a shaman sees many summers and does this many times
their grandchildren's grandchildren might still be able to call them."

My brother Walks-In-Storm scowled as I spoke.
He often did around the big-nosed sternsman.
We were twins,
and he had taken to hunting as I had taken to the shaman's ways.
He said little when Saknus was near,
or left the tent if he could.
We had been as close as teeth before Saknus came.
It hurt me that we grew apart in those years.

---

"Damn his eyes, where is he?"
Luft stands and begins to pace again.
"We only have a couple of hours of daylight
and the fucking camels are going to want to be fed soon."

Torvane sits on the rear of the sled,
wrapping and unwrapping the traces around her hands.
"He'll be here.
He said first light, so maybe he meant---"

"We should do this on our own."
Luft packs a snowball and throws it against the driftwood fence that rings the trading post.
"I told you when we got here, we can do this ourselves.
Why in fuck's name do we need him?"
Another snowball smacks against the fence.

Torvane spots a dark blot approaching the gate.
"Here he is."
She struggles to her feet inside a double layer of furs,
wincing as her weight comes down on her injured toe.
"Hoy, Walker, good weather!"

The blot becomes the Nukilbo's solid bulk.
Half a head shorter than the magician,
he is wide across the shoulders and waist.
His face is almost completely hidden in his parka's black hood.
A small pack,
a pair of skis,
and two spears are all he carries.

He nods when he reaches the two en-Ruuda
and lays his skis on the snow.
"The snowpack is good from here to the mountains,"
he says without premable,
lashing his pack to the rear of the sled.

"We likely to bump into anyone else?"
Torvane asks casually.

Walker shakes his head.
"No one will be there this time of the year.
They will all be starboard where there are furs.
Or sewing blankets,"
he adds with a trace of bitterness.

He begins to check the sled's traces.
The woolly camels grumble and snuffle his hands, hoping for treats.
"I already did that," Luft says sharply
as the Nukilbo tugs and twists the leather straps,
making minute adjustments and tightening knots.
Torvane shushes her partner with a handwave.

Walker makes a final slight adjustment
and pats one of the camels on his head.
"Maybe three, maybe four days to the mountains with these.
If the weather is good,"
he adds.

He straps on his skis as carefully as he tested the camels' traces,
picks up his spears,
reverses them,
and pushes off.
With a whistle to the camels Torvane follows in the sled.
Muttering under his breath,
Luft follows behind,
a thick knit cap on his head
and his sword bumping against his leg.

The trading post disappears behind the first hill
and is soon forgotten in the weary monotony of travel.
The first snows of autumn have smoothed the tundra around them,
turning long gravel eskers into unmoving white waves
broken here and there by islands of rock too large to yet be covered.
A solitary speargull parallels their path
for a time before turning sternward toward the coast.

Walker stays in front,
his steady rhythm almost hypnotic.
Seated on the sled,
Torvane finally grunts and pulls a small flask from a pocket of her parka.
She draws the cork with her teeth and slurps the burning liquor.

"Walker!" she calls.
"Time to make camp!"
The horizon has swallowed the dull copper sun.
They go another half-gallop before Walker halts
in the meager protection of a slight hollow.
He stands his skis and spears together in the snow
as Luft comes forward to the sled.

"Fuck a whale, I ache all over."
The en-Ruuda stretches and yawns.
"Set up the tents, I'll look after the camels."
Torvane frowns,
but relaxes when Walker takes a small shovel from the sled
and begins thumping a patch of snow to flatten it.

As the Nukilbo erects their tent
Torvane plants five stakes in a circle around their camp.
She is tying a design on them in red cord
when she realizes that Walker has stopped to watch her.
"Anything wrong?"
she asks.

The Nukilbo scowls.
"What is this?"

Torvane shrugs.
"A warding spell.
If anyone crosses it during the night,
it'll wake me up.
Just a precaution."

The Nukilbo grunts and goes back to work.
After a moment,
Torvane shrugs and goes back to her spell.

---

*"Be at peace, brother.
She is not strong, or I would feel her now.
I do not even know if she can do what needs done."*

*"Then why must I go with them?"*

*"Because you swore an oath.
As your father my brother swore,
and as your grandmother my sister and her father my brother all swore."
My voice is a whisper.
I re-make the magician's spell after Walker returns to the camp.
Somewhere nearby a lynx smells me
and growls unhappily before hurrying away.*

---

And then one day Saknus destroyed us.
When the sun was so strong that it shone all night the Nukiliyorongbo gathered
to trade and arrange marriages and welcome new shamans.
There was singing and dancing
and games of skill as young men and women tried to impress skeptical mothers and fathers.

My brother Walks-In-Storm won easily at spear-throwing and running,
but I did not compete.
I was preparing to receive the scars of a shaman.
"I am sorry you have no ancestors to wrestle," I said to Saknus.

He smiled.
After four years among us,
he still showed his teeth when he did this.
"The stars are such as they have not been in many years, Holds-On-Too-Long," he said.
"Who knows what might happen?"
Then he laughed and I laughed with him,
for what did the stars have to do with magic?

I went out the next morning onto the tundra
with my mother and two other shamans.
I returned that evening with a crusted wound on each cheek
and a tooth from my grandmother's father on a thong around my neck.
His spirit had faded so much that he could barely light a fire,
but I had never been prouder.

We came back to find people gathered around the field in the center of the camp.
"The stranger is going to show us a new game,"
my brother said,
scowling.

Saknus had drawn a complicated pattern on the field with sand,
a star with five points enclosed in a circle.
Strange symbols ringed it,
and torch stakes stood at each point.
He waved to us and smiled,
then raised his arm into the air.

Suddenly his hand was covered with flame.
People oohed and aahed around us
as Saknus lit each of the torches in turn.
"How does he do this?"
Walks-In-Storm demanded.
"You said he could not wrestle!"

My mother shook her head.
"He is not wrestling," she said.
"I do not know what he is doing."

When all the torches were lit
the fire on Saknus's hand flickered out.
He closed his eyes and let hell loose upon us.

My uncle was standing beside me.
He screamed and fell to the ground,
clawing at his throat.
I saw a dim form sitting astride him,
strangling him with four hands
while smoke poured from its eyes.

He's killing us!" my brother shouted as other shamans doubled over or simply collapsed.
He threw his spear.
It faltered and fell to the earth outside Saknus's circle.

People ran from the field.
I did not.
Sworn only that day,
I was still a shaman.
I called the one ancestor I had,
as the other shamans called those whose bones they carried,
but none could batter through the wall Saknus had created.

When it finally ended,
two dozen shamans and many others lay dead on the grass.
I stood there with tears on my face,
unable even to curse Saknus in my rage.
He opened his eyes and smiled.

"Holds-On-Too-Long," he said approvingly,
ignoring the spears, rocks, and corpses that lay around him.
"Good. Very good. You are going to help me now."

Spirit hands closed around my throat.

---

Walker finds tracks their third day out.
He is in front as aways,
arms and legs swinging in a steady tempo.
He and Luft no longer speak to each other unless they absolutely have to,
and sometimes not even then.
As the Nukilbo say,
travel does not change you---it just makes you more like who you always were.

Suddenly Walker swerves and stops.
Torvane reins in the camels and puts her flask back in her pocket.
"What's the problem?" she asks,
clambering unsteadily off the sled.

The Nukilbo pulls his feet from his skis and bends nearly double,
intent on the snow.
Above them the sky is clear, bright, and bitterly cold.

Luft shooshes to a stop behind his partner.
"What wrong?"

Torvane shakes her head.
"I don't know. Walker?"
The woolly camels have dropped onto the snow,
taking the opportunity to rest.
One snarks as another snaps at it.

The Nukilbo walks slowly back and forth before straightening up.
"*Matsheshkulak*," he says grimly,
scanning the horizon.
"Bandits.
On foot, maybe a hand of them, two days ago.
Going for'ard."

There is a moment's silence,
then Luft spits.
"You said nobody was going to be around," he says accusingly.

"Luft! Be quiet."
The magician takes a deep breath.
"Do you think they're close?"

The Nukilbo shakes his head.
"Two days ago.
There is nothing for them here.
They will be gone."

Another moment of silence,
then Luft spits again.
"Marvelous.
Bloody fucking marvelous.
First nobody's here, and now they're two days gone.
I suppose we'll be cooking for them tonight, eh?"

"They are two days gone."
For the first time Torvane hears annoyance in Walker's voice.
"You will not cook them supper tonight, little man."

"I told you not to call me that!"
Luft knocks Torvane's arm out of his way and strides through the snow.

Walker ignores him.
"We should not let the camels rest too long,"
he tells Torvane calmly,
turning back to his skis.

"Hey!
Look at me when I'm talking to you!"
Luft swings roundhouse.

Walker grabs one of his spears to block the punch,
twisting it and clubbing Luft in the head.
The en-Ruuda's knit cap flies off,
revealing a leather and steel helmet on his head.
Luft snarls and draws his sword.
Walker reverses his spear and braces himself.

A sudden flash blinds them both.

When Luft's vision clears he is sitting in the snow.
His sword is still in his hands,
and his head aches.
Walker stands a few meters away with his hands over his eyes.

The camels are blatting furiously.
Torvane is trying to soothe them.
She glances at her partner.
"Serves you right," she says curtly.
"Walker! How are your eyes?"

The Nukilbo lowers his hands,
squints,
and wipes tears from his cheeks.
He looks at Torvane for a long instant
before picking up his spear.
"We have lost time," he says.
He walks back to his skis and straps them on.

Torvane helps her partner to his feet.
Luft shakes her off and spits in the snow.
"Just get rid of him,"
he hisses.
"We can do this ourselves."

"Shut up!"
The magician clutches Luft's sleeve and pulls him close.
"Just stay out of his way, all right?
The sooner we're through this,
the better for both of us."

Minutes later the trio is moving for'ard again.
The magician busies herself with her own thoughts.
Luft curses Walker in time with his poling.
The Nukilbo pretends not to hear.

---

The mountains are no older than the rest of the world,
but seem stooped beneath ice and snow.
The sun is a hard disk just above the horizon
when Walker tells the others it is time to leave the sled.

"Today, walking, will bring us to your place,"
the Nukilbo says as Luft and Torvane sort through their gear.

Luft says something under his breath,
then straightens and shoulders his pack.
"I'm ready when you are," he tells his partner.
"Let's get up there."

Torvane stuffs a few more vials and pouches into her parka
and laces the pockets closed.
"That ought to do it.
Ready, Walker?
Right, then, and off."
With Walker leading and Luft in the rear
the three began their ascent.

I wait until they are a hand of hundreds of strides gone
before I cut the camels' tethers.
They flee,
bleating to each other.

A narrow ledge winds up the mountain.
In some places it is wide enough for a camp.
In others it vanishes completely
so that the trio have to inch sideways along the rock face.
The stone is slippery underfoot,
and the wind is bitterly cold.

Walker pauses occasionally to let the others catch up.
Torvane struggles behind him breathing great irregular clouds of steam.
Luft curses steadily at the mountain and the ice,
at his sword for the way it bumps against his leg,
and most of all at fate and fortune for bring him here.

Neither en-Ruuda notices the sky turn gray until the first flakes of snow began to fall.
"Bloody fucking hell,"
Luft curses when Torvane drops her weight onto a convenient bulge of the mountain and gulps air.
"Should have stayed in Jalkelainin waiting trial
instead of following you and that damned old map of yours."

The magician shakes her head.
"Better cold, than dead," she pants.
"Almost there.
Come on.
The cave,
should be,
just a little,
further.
We can rest there," she adds,
almost like a prayer,
as she struggles to her feet.

An hour later the storm is so thick that they can only see an arm's length in any direction.
Walker is a dozen steps ahead of the others,
testing the snow with the butt of his spear.
Luft is helping the magician up a steep section of the path
when war cries split the air.

"'Ware yourself!" Luft shouts,
spinning and drawing his sword as a parka-clad figure drops to the path behind him.
The en-Ruuda knocks aside a spear thrust.
As his attacker pulls back for another try Luft cuts viciously at his attacker's hands.

Another man drops to the path behind the first.
"Yeaaaaaaah!"
Luft knocks his opponent's spear aside and slams into him,
pushing him back into the second man.
All three go down in a heap.
Luft rolls to the side,
almost sliding off the path.
His backhand cut bites into flesh.

He pulls his sword free and scrambles back to his feet.
One man lies on the path,
bleeding from the neck,
dying.
Scuffed snow shows where the second has slid down the mountain into the storm.

"Luft! It's me, Luft, it's me."
The magician points above them.
"They must have been waiting for us on that ridge."

The berserker rage is still boiling in her partner.
"Waiting for us, were they?"
Droplets of blood scribe a delicate arc in the snow as he waves his sword.
"One fucking guess who fucking let them know we were fucking coming!"
He spits and kicks the corpse.
"Fucking sealfuckers!"

"Walker!" Torvane shouts. "Walker, are you there?"

"Oh for fuck's sake, give it over!"
Luft shouts as Torvane fills her lungs to call again.
"He's gone, isn't he? And good riddance, I say."

Torvane slumps,
staring at the dead man as the falling snow makes him a shroud.
"We need him, Luftie."
Her voice is almost pleading.

"Why?" Luft demands.
"What in hell can he do that I can't?"

Torvane sighs.
"Nothing," she finally says.
"Come on, we're almost there."

Luft wipes his blade on the corpse's parka but does not sheathe it.
The two en-Ruuda start trudging up the mountain again
as the storm swirls around them.

---

Walker is almost relieved when he hears the war cries.
A bandit drops to the path in front of him and feints a high lunge.
As Walker parries it a second bandit lands on his back,
knocking him off the path.

He fights like a lynx as they slid down the mountain,
ignoring the rocks that slam into him.
The bandit punches his ribs.
Walker snarls and pulls the knife from his belt.
The bandit clutches Walker's arm with one hand
and tries to punch him again with the other.

The pair tumble into a drift of snow.
Walker rolls to his feet.
"Stop, my brother!" I whisper.

What-Color-Wind slides to a stop on the lip of the small cleft in which we are hidden.
"Where-Goes-Crow is dead," he says,
jumping down beside us.
"The little big-nose killed him."

Walker is rigid with rage.
"You have betrayed me," he says tightly.
"I unsay my oath.
You are no more my brother."

I would sigh if I could.
Behind me are half a dozen bandits,
all but one aiming a spear or bow at my great-grandnephew.
"You are with friends, my brother," I tell him.

"Liar!" he spits.
He leaps at me.
I catch his arm and throw him to the ground.

"Do not try my patiencen,"
I warn him as he glares up at me.
"How-Far-Thrown! Are they there yet?"

The shaman is weak---they all are now---but he closes his eyes
and fondles his mother's thighbone.
"Someone says no," he says,
careful not to name her as they wrestle.
"They are still climbing.
The angry one hopes to fight.
The wrestler---"

"She is not a wrestler," I interrupt.
"What she does is different, and better.
Rest."
The old man relaxes,
sweat-steam smoking off his face.

I think for a moment, then,
"What-Color-Wind! Give me your parka."
The bandit disrobes, shivering.
I reverse the parka so that the inner white fur makes me almost invisible in the snow.
I am unused to the constriction of clothing after so long.
"Walks-With-The-Dead, you will stay here."

"I hate you," Walker says, and means it.
"I wish my great-grandfather had killed you."

"I do too."
I stuff the mittens into the tops of the boots
and start to claw my way up the snow-covered rock.

---

I awoke lying on cold stone,
bound hand and foot.
Above me the cave roof was a half-dome as smooth as the sky.
Light from a small dayglass lantern showed Saknus on his knees,
carefully painting the polished floor.

"Ten thousand years, chancellor!"
he muttered to himself.
"Ten thousands years since there have been such stars.
How can we in good conscience not use them?"
He examined what he had just painted,
then licked his thumb and wiped at it.

"Monster," I whispered.
My throat was so dry that only a croak came out.

"Yes, I know there are risks," he continued.
"But think of what we could do---we could stand with the Pilots themselves!"

"Monster," I said again, louder.
"This place is sacred."

He looked up.
"Oh, good, you're awake.
How is your head?"

"You will never know warmth or rest," I spat.
"The ghosts of our shamans will drag you down to hell."

"Oh, I don't think so."
He gestured behind him.
"I have all of their necklaces-of-bones over there."
He smiled indulgently.
"Real magic can do a lot that your people don't know about, Holds-On-Too-Long.
Between what your mother taught me and what I already knew,
reaching and using all your ghosts isn't going to be hard."

"But why?"
I had not wanted to ask, or to weep.

"Good question," he said approvingly,
a teacher pleased with his student.
"I'm going to try to bind a demon like the ones I used at your camp,
only much, much larger.
I need a lot of power to do it---more than my people know how to control.
When I read about how your shamans do magic..."
He shrugged.
"It was a sign."

"Traitor. You will be damned for this."

He grinned.
"Actually, if this works, I'll be the one doing the damning."

It took him two days to complete his pattern.
He gave me water but no food.
By the time he was finished I was light-headed and could not stop shivering.

He laid me out on the stone slab in the center of the cave
and stripped off my parka and boots.
"Now, you may be wondering what your role is to be in our little play,"
Saknus said in the same voice my mother used with children when setting a broken bone.
"Well, I need a treat to offer my demon as bait.
And you, my friend, are going to be that for me."

He painted a pattern on my forehead,
then spoke words never meant for a human throat.
I suddenly felt heavier than iron,
as I had when I swore the shaman's oath only a few days before.
This time, though, the sensation did not fade.

He nodded and put the boxes containing the stolen necklaces-of-bones beside me.
"That spell will prevent your spirit from running away," he explained
as he check each portion of the painted pattern one last time,
talking more to himself than to me.
"The demon will bring more and more of itself into this world to try to get to you.
And when it's all here,
I will command your shamans' spirits to---"

He cut himself off at my howl of rage.
"Fine," he muttered.
"Be that way."
Then he drew a knife from his belt and cut open my throat.

Hot blood ran down past my ears.
Saknus stepped back,
stooped to add a final arc to the design on the floor,
and began to chant.

My sight faded as his voice grew louder and louder.
A cold wind from nowhere
brought a stench like all the rot the world had ever made.

And there were voices---Nukiliyorongbo voices,
my grandfather's and others that I did not know,
chanting with Saknus,
building towards a climax.
Something was coming closer,
something infinitely worse than the shadows that I had seen in the camp.

Saknus and I screamed at the same instant.
My vision snapped back to normal.
I turned my head with immense effort to see him lying dead beside the pattern
with a spear through his chest.
Walks-In-Storm stood at the entrance to the cave, calling my name.

My limbs felt like they were made of stone,
but somehow I stood.
I stepped over Saknus's body.
The air crackled around me as I left the pattern.

"Come!" my brother shouted.
I took a few steps,
leaning like a cripple on his arm,
then stopped.

"The necklaces," I said. "We must get the necklaces."
All my people's power...

I turned and shambled back,
but when I tried to step into the pattern I could not.
I told Walks-In-Storm to try, but he could not either.
As my heart stopped beating,
I tried one last time to weep.

---

The path becomes steeper as it takes a final quarter-turn around the mountain.
I could easily catch up with them,
but I want them to reach the cave before me.

The storm is raging by the time the two en-Ruuda find the cave mouth.
For a moment I fear they will stumble past it,
blinded by snow and fatigue,
but the small one shouts and points.
They squeeze through the narrow entrance.
I count to a hundred and follow.

They have left their packs at the entrance.
I don What-Color-Wind's mittens
and pull the hood of the parka forward to hide my features.

The cave roof is still as round and as smooth as a clear sky.
The short en-Ruuda holds up a lantern as the magician surveys the chamber.
An elaborate design,
faded only slightly with age,
is painted on the floor around a slab of stone,
two wooden boxes,
and a corpse mummified by the cold with a spear protruding awkwardly from its back.

Torvane hums under her breath as she studies the scene.
"Can you get through it?" Luft asks.

"I think so."
She unties a pocket,
pulls something from it,
and then kneels and begins to draw.

I edge forward a step and then stop,
unable to get close enough to see what she is doing without exposing myself.
I would curse,
but she might feel that,
so I swear instead.
It was worth learning to speak en-Ruuda just for that---they are an angry people
with a vocabulary to match

After a few minutes Torvane stands,
her knees cracking.
"Give me the lantern," she says.
Luft hands it to her.
"And your sword."
At Luft's quizzical look the magician adds, "No iron."
Does that matter?
There is so much I don't know.

"Now kneel there.
No, more to the left."
Putting the sword aside,
Torvane finishes drawing her design around her partner,
then sets the lantern down beside him.
"All right, keep your eyes on those boxes.
When they start to glow, you get in there and grab them."

"When they glow," Luft repeats.
I can hear his heartbeat.
"Ready when you are."

Torvane begins to chant in a language I do not know.
I feel power stir at her command and wonder what this spell is costing her.
Will she no longer be able to taste food?
Or remember her parents' names?
The magic the en-Ruuda do always has a price.

Luft crouches, eyes fixed on the treasure he has come so far to claim.
Torvane's voice grows louder, more commanding.
She shouts three words,
then reaches down and lifts Luft's sword and swings it down into his neck.

There is a sudden surge of power as the century-old pentacle breaks.
The lantern flickers.
The only sound is the magician sobbing.

I am astonished, and then angry---very angry.
I have been studying stolen books for a century,
teaching myself en-Ruuda magic in the hope of finding a way to break that pattern.
None even hinted that murder might do the trick.

The lantern light steadies.
With the sword still in her hand Torvane steps toward the two boxes.

"There is no gold," I whisper.
She shrieks and spins around.

"Who's there?" He looks abut wildly. "Name yourself!"

I step into the light, my head bowed.
"There is no gold," I repeat.
"There never was."

"Who are you?"
She looks older, drawn.
Her spell has cost her dearly.

"I am Holds-On-Too-Long.
Walker's great-granduncle and oath-brother."
I take another step toward her.

"But my map---" she begins.

"I made that, and let it go sternward."
Another step.

She turns and knocks the lid off the nearest box with the sword,
then stares at the necklaces-of-bones.
"That's all?"
There are tears on her cheeks.

"That's all," I reply.
"There is nothing here but bones."

She chokes,
then shouts a word to pull the air from my lungs
and charges at me,
sword raised.

I feint to the left,
then lean into her lunge.
The sword slides through the parka,
through my chest,
and out my back.
Torvane's eyes go wide as the hood falls back from my rotted features.

"Too late," she hears me whisper
as my mummified hands close around her neck.

---

We died all winter the year Saknus took our magic from us.
No-one could call up seals, so people starved.
No-one could heal the sick and injured.

And no-one could break the spell that bound my spirit to my corpse.

In the spring a troop of en-Ruuda arrived,
magicians who had felt his spell
and soldiers to kill him.
We slew them all,
though at great cost.
I stole their books and learned enough of their magic
to hide the pentacle in the mountain.
It was not enough:
the en-Ruuda had seen furs and gold.
They came back in strength,
bringing the coughing sickness and the bleeding sickness and whisky.

So I swore an oath with my brother,
drew maps,
told his children and their children to spread rumors,
and practiced patience.

---

How-Far-Thrown makes a sign when I return
with the necklaces-of-bones wrapped around my mummified neck.
The wind whistles between my ribs where flesh rotted away
before I learned to stay in the cold.
Walks-With-The-Dead has a new bruise on his cheek.
One of the bandits has his arm in a sling.

"It is done," I tell them needlessly.
"We have our magic back.
Walker!
You are going to be a chief now.
You are going to be the greatest chief the Nukiliyorongbo have ever known."

He spits toward me.
"Monster," he says.
"I take back my oath.
We are no longer brothers."

I would laugh if I could.
"Your great-grandfather said the same thing when first saw my throat open to the wind,"
I tell him.
"But I made him chief.
I made his daughter a chief,
and her son your father,
and now I will make you the greatest of chiefs.
You will lead the people to war.
You will push the big-noses back into the sea
and restore the old ways."

"I will not!" he shouts.

I wear all the magic my people once had around my neck.
For a moment I let them see the legion of ghosts standing around me,
bound to their bones as Saknus's spell had bound me to mine.

"You will," I promise him.
A cold wind blows through my ribs.
"They will call you chief, and follow you to war.
And they will learn to call me king."
