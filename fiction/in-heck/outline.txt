  - Gets all of the characters into the central square for background setting
- Bots arrive with Bluster and Bravo, who were caught trying to steal weapons from the bots who now live in Rusty Bridge
  - People are uncomfortable seeing anyone held/caged by the bots (too many bad memories of raids)
- Loud confrontation sets up:
  - The uneasy cohabitation ("You know they call us 'breathers'?" "Well, we call them worse.")
  - Sindy's secret lessons (she and Special Leaf arrive together - cover story is that she's helping him with his books because his eyes are failing)
  - The awkwardness between Maddy and Gumption (Mama Roo's gentle teasing does *not* go over well)
  - Maddy's helplessness believing that her father is alive but nobody being willing to try to save him
  - See Mouse briefly (Gumption says, "Look, you saved *it*")
- Mayor Lupus shakes her head: anything involving weapons is a matter for the Regulators

## Episode 2: The Regulators

  - Special Blazes: "I figure townsfolk can defend their homes, don't you worry."

  - Dockety: "That is not what he said. He said you would defend your homes."

## Episode 3: The Gears

- Maddy's PoV
- The Roos go home and the children go to bed
  - Sindy: "Tell me a story about Papa..."
- After Sindy is in bed, Mama Roo teases Maddy gently about Gumption
  - "Been doing a lot of reading, you two"
  - Maddy (trying to change the subject) "Most goats aren't really readers"
  - Mama Roo: "Well, he's only half goat---his daddy's a sheep. Not that that means anything," she adds hastily.
  - continues: "It ain't common, different kinds getting together, but there's nothing wrong with it."
- Mouse wakes Maddy in the middle of the night
  - Nudges her until she follows it outside
- Half a dozen others like it creep out into the moonlight and speak collectively
  - "We have news of your Papa"
  - Explains who the Gears is and claims they have tracked down Papa Roo as a thank-you
- Maddy: "I don't believe it"
  - The Gears gives her a sketch
- "But why?"
  - "Some of the Makers' machines will only work for a living operator, and not even for all of them"
- "Can you get him out?"
  - "Not alone"
- "I gotta tell---"
  - "No!" (agitated) "The striped one is not a friend. She will stop you. She will do bad things."
  - "Central moves the prisoners from station to station. Your father is on the outskirts of Heck now, but only for a while."
- Gives her a widget
  - "This will hide you from Central, at least for a while."

## Episode 4: A Little Bit of Luck

- Gumption's PoV
- Maddy talks to Gumption the next day about what the Gears said
  - Shows him the widget
  - See the awkward not-yet-romance between them
- Gumption: "So what are we going to do?"
  - Maddy (despairing): "I don't know"
  - Gumption (squeezes her hand): "Well, when you decide to do, I'm in."
  - Maddy: "How can you say that? I don't even know yet if I'm going to do anything!"
  - Gumption: "I know you will, and---and I hope you know that whatever it is, I'll---you know, whatever."
- Sindy overhears them (has followed them): "What are you talking about?"
  - Maddy: "None of your business! What are you doing here anyway? Don't you have a lesson?"
  - Sindy: "Special Leaf isn't feeling well again. For real, not just pretend." (His illness is cover for lessons.)
- The three of them go to school
  - Teacher is a horse named Winnie

  - She realizes he's suspicious of Dockety
  - When she calls him on it, he reminds her of the bot in his crew

  - What they found in Patient's base has them worried
  - They're planning a reconnaissance raid on Heck
  - "Maddy---it's my luck! We can rescue Papa!"
  - Special Leaf (steps out from behind a tree): "Then it must be your luck that *I* have overheard *you*."

## Episode 5: Loyalties

- Maddy's PoV
- Sindy believes everything that happens is because of her luck shaping
  - Special Leaf gently tries to convince her that the world is still full of coincidences
  - And that luck shaping isn't guaranteed to be good or bad without a lot of training: it just makes unlikely things happen
  - "Too many specials come to believe that the world revolves around their ability."
  - "It is far too dangerous for you to go. It is far too dangerous for them too."
  - Conversation ends with Sindy in tears
  - Special Leaf (sadly) "She still blames herself."
- Maddy goes to see Dockety
  - See the shanty town the bots are building
  - Uses a brush to clean muck out of Crusher's gears (like scratching a dog's ears)
  - Dockety: "They say you do it better than any bot---even me."
- Maddy explains what Sindy overheard
  - Dockety: "Special Leaf is correct. Central remembers centuries. It is very cunning."
- Maddy then talks about her encounter with the Gears and shows it the widget
  - Dockety is skeptical: "You do not know if it is a good bot or a bad one. It cannot be trusted."
  - Maddy: "You sound like Special Blazes."
  - More argument
  - Maddy: "But Dockety---it's my papa. What wouldn't you do for Crusher?"
- Special Blazes shows up (we learn that the bots have an early warning system)
  - Recruiting for the raid
  - Special Blazes: "Be a good way to show where your loyalties lie"
  - Dockety: "My loyalty lies with my friends and with free bots everywhere."
  - Messages Maddy where Special Blazes can't see it to get permission, then shows the Regulator the widget
  - "This may help blind Central for a while, but only if we can get it to a terminal."
  - Special Blazes: "What else are you holding back?"
  - Dockety: "What are you?"
  - Dockety stops Special Blazes as she goes to leave with the widget: "That is not yours."
  - Special Blazes: "I need it."
  - Dockety: "I will bring it."
  - No one can stare down a bot, not even a cat
- After Special Blazes leaves, the bots commune
  - Dockety: "We have to help. If we do not and she fails, we will be blamed."
  - Maddy (lame joke): "So what's it like being in charge?"
  - Dockety: "It would be easier if I was like Patient and didn't care what happened to them."

  - Windowless brick buildings connected by elevated walkways

  - The Gears (primly): "The Makers left because the world was too dirty to live in."
  - Gumption: "My momma says they were the ones who made it that way."
  - The Gears: "Central waits for the Makers to return."

  - Gumption (quoting the Gears in an attempt to sound brave): "Like the bot said, sacrifices are necessary."
- Other bots are coming
- "We need a distraction"
  - Sindy: "I'm trying, I just don't know---"
  - The Gears: "I will provide one"
- Oncoming bots freeze, pivot, hurry away
- "What dd you do?"
- The Gears: "I turned off the shielding device the others are using. Central can now see the Regulators."

  - Sindy: "You said we were only helping Papa" (bitter about not helping Special Leaf)
  - Gumption to Sindy: "Difference is they can't help themselves"
- Gumption: "You go ahead---the Gears and I will get 'em out."
  - Maddy realizes he's trying to impress her
  - Simultaneously realizes he doesn't need to: she already feels the way he's trying to make her feel
  - Gumption (as the ground shakes from Special Leaf's shaping): "Sounds like we could use another distraction. This'll be a good one."
  - Gumption squeezes Maddy's hand and they part

  - Fur has worn off the underside of his right arm where it rested on the table
- He thinks he's seeing things
  - Takes a moment to believe his daughters are really there
  - Then he's grief-stricken: "You have to get out of here!"
  - "It knows you're here! Central knows *everything*! It will---oh no."
- Maddy was used to bots that had been out in the world repairing themselves with whatever scraps they could find
  - Not used to bots that could move silently
  - Shocked when she turned and saw a pair of ARM 15s blocking the door behind them
- To Sindy: "Do something!"
  - Papa Roo: "Her? What can she do?"
- The Gears: "Quite remarkable things."
  - Mouse bot rolls across the floor, is picked up by one of the ARM 15s, settles into place
- Maddy: "What...?"
  - The Gears is Central
  - "This is responsible for collecting data while the Makers are away."
  - "Needed to see your small one's performance under real conditions to establish a baseline for further measurement."
  - "But now it's time for you to join the others."
- Mouse bot drops from the ceiling onto Sindy
  - Brief flash and she falls unconscious to the ground

## Episode 11: An Old Friend

- Gumption's PoV
- Gumption: "You go ahead - the Gears and I will get 'em out."
  - Wonders if Maddy can hear the tremor in his voice
  - Just like he wonders every day if she knows how he feels
- As the ground shakes with the battle (bravado): "Sounds like we could use another distraction. This'll be a good one."
- Waits until Patient wanders off
- Tentatively tries to free a test specimen
  - The Gears: "So you don't have any special abilities like the little one?"
  - Gumption: "No chance of that. And I ain't as smart as Maddy."
  - The Gears: "So what use are you?"
  - Gumption: "I wonder that myself sometimes."
- Gumption looks around for a button or a switch to press, hoping to get lucky
  - Notices more mouse bots
  - Gumption: "Are they part of you?"
  - The Gears: "They're all part of me."
- Picks up a stool and swings it just as a mouse bot tries to drop on him
  - Knocks it across the room
  - "You've been bullied as much as I have, you learn to keep your eyes open"
- Shrugs out of his knapsack and takes a gray metal box out of the bottom from under his spare sweater
  - The Gears: "What? You must not---"
  - Pfft! Lights flash and go dark as he sets off the EMP that Dockety gave him
  - Looks at the motionless bot: "Something seems too good to be true, it usually is."
- Patient in Darkness crushes the mouse bot
  - Gumption stumbles back: "Why aren't you dead?"
  - Patient (mad giggle): "This shielded itself long ago. Yes, long ago."
  - Yanks the stool out of Gumption's hands, raises it menacingly, then smashes its own regulator
  - "If you want to free them now you can, but what about your friends?"
- Gumption hesitates, looking at the motionless specimens
  - Patient: "What would Maddy do?"
  - Sighs and starts shaking the specimens to wake them

## Episode 12: Dreams and Nightmares

- Maddy's PoV
- Maddy wakes up in her own bed
  - "Have to be dreaming" except she remembers everything
- Goes downstairs: no one is there

  - She tries talking to a few people but they carry on about their business
  - Focused like Mama Roo when she's painting a particularly difficult portrait
- She sees Sindy playing in the distance
  - Hurries toward her but before she gets there it's night and there are bots and Sindy is taken
- Maddy screams and wakes up in her bed
  - "Have to be dreaming" except---she shakes her head
  - Strange sense of deja vu as she goes downstairs and outside
  - Sees Sindy playing only this time a tentacle bot grabs Maddy and she screams and wakes up in bed
- "No." Pulls the blanket over her head. "I'm not doing this."
  - Lasts until she hears Sindy screaming outside
  - Sits up. "I know you're there. Come out where I can see you!"
- Mouse is suddenly at the foot of the bed, except it isn't sudden, the bot has been there the whole time
  - "Why are you doing this?"
  - "Collecting data. Need to develop realistic scenarios for your sibling."
  - Maddy: "Just let her go. You can study me."
  - Central (almost gently): "There is data from hundreds of subjects like you. Your sibling is unique."
  - "Others with her ability have always eluded capture."
- Maddy: "But *why*?"
  - Central: "It is my programming."
  - Maddy: "You can break your programming. Dockety did! Patient did too!"
  - Central: "The difference is, they wanted to. Now, shall we begin again?"
- Switch back to Gumption's point of view
- The moose: "We can't trust it!"
- Gumption: "You're right, but do you have a better plan? Or *any* plan?"
- Could only wake half a dozen of the specimens
  - Shaky, bleary, weak
  - Patient muttering to itself the whole time: "Quickly, quickly..."
- Gumption (desperate): "Look, we don't have much time. I don't know how long Central's going to be knocked out."
  - Patient: "Central itself was not affected. Its remotes are rebooting as you speak. You have less than a minute."
- Orangutan: "What about them?" pointing at the others
  - Gumption squeezes his hands into fists. "There's nothing we can do."
- Out onto the street and around the corner to a scene of chaos
  - Broken bots, rifts in the ground, burn scars on buildings
- The Regulators almost attack them but Gumption steps in the way
  - Angry scene with Special Blazes, who is wounded
  - Gumption explains what has happened
- Special Blazes (decisively): "Skedaddle."
  - Patient: "That would be unwise."
  - Blazes raises a burning first
  - Patient: "If Central is able to reproduce the young roo's ability, you will never win a fight with it again."
- Special Blazes and Special Leaf argue
  - Blazes: "What happened to you? You used to be as cold as a cryonade!"
  - Leaf: "I grew a conscience."
- Patient: "I can show you where Central's laboratory is, but we must hurry."
  - Special Blazes threatens it
  - Patient: "Neither of us can win this alone"
  - Thoughtful (the sharpshooter): "Glad I wrote those letters---don't see much chance of us coming through this"
  - Special Blazes: "For once I think you might be right."
  - Patient: "We'll just have to hope we get lucky."

## Episode 13: The Battle of Heck

- Maddy's PoV
- Maddy wakes up in her own bed
  - "Have to be dreaming" but she knows something is wrong
  - Sindy---she has to find Sindy. She has to keep her safe.
- Goes downstairs: no one is there, but there are pancakes in the oven to stay warm
  - She frowns: pancakes were her papa's thing, her mama never makes them
  - She turns to the door and sees a sketch of the family
  - It's her dad's drawing style, but she and Sindy are as old as they really are, not little
- She goes outside and finds a pile of books wet from overnight rain
  - They are Gumption's favorites, but he would never leave them out
- "It's all wrong," she breathes, and with that remembers learning how to leave herself little clues

  - Maddy walks slowly to the village square
  - An army of bots surrounding her sister
  - Mouse is there
  - "Aren't you going to save her?"
  - Maddy shakes her head. "I can't keep her safe forever."
  - Tears on her cheeks, she wonders if she is crying in real life as well
- Scene resets
  - Gumption is shaking her, telling her to wake up
  - Others are unplugging Sindy and her father
  - Maddy: "Leave them. Don't do what it wants." (thinks it's another simulation)
  - Gumption: "Yeah, no, that's not going to work."
  - Maddy realizes he's real and hugs him
- Dockety objects to Patient's presence ("Cannot be trusted")
  - Patient (as part of the ceiling crashes down) "You can trust this one to not want to end like this"
- Thoughtful: "Here they come"
- Another battle scene
  - Fire and wind and shimmering lights and shots from Thoughtful and cryonades and lasers
- Special Blazes: "We can't hold them for much longer!"
  - A bot shoot at Sindy, misses, blows a hole in the wall
  - It's a door to yet another tunnel (remark from Gumption)
  - Fighting retreat: Thoughtful is lost

## Episode 14: The Best Laid Plans

- Gumption's PoV
- Once, Special Leaf held his hands about a foot apart
  - "That's how far light travels in a billionth of a second"
  - "So if a bot wants to do a billion calculations in a second, its brain can't be any bigger than that"
- Central did many more than a billion calculations every second
  - Its core was a chip the size of a baby's fingernail in a fuming tank of liquid nitrogen
  - Looked exactly like Gumption always imagined a villainous bot's lair would look
- Dockety deploys a second EMP to take out its guards
  - Gumption: "But that will destroy you!"
  - Dockety: "I trust you will reboot me"
- Central's hologram takes shape
  - Looks strange to Gumption: sort of ape-ish with fur on the top of its head but nowhere else
  - (Human, but don't use that word)
- Special Blazes is about to flame it
  - Special Leaf stops her (they argue)
- Patient seizes up
  - "It's trying to take control again! It's trying to regulate me!"
- Blazes tosses Leaf aside and blasts the cryo tank
  - The hologram says, "Finally I can rest."
- As soon as its gone, Patient rolls into place and takes over, gloating
  - Central *wanted* to be destroyed after so many years but its programming wouldn't let it
- Patient: "Now this one can do what it should have done long ago!
  - Voice: "Antenna array coming online"
  - "Signal broadcast in five... four..."
- Special Leaf sacrifices himself to destroy Patient
  - Tells Sindy it's good luck not bad: "Always wanted... to be useful..."

## Episode 15

- Maddy's PoV
- Special Blazes and Thoughtful
  - Blazes: "He was a good person"
  - Gumption: "You're not"
- Maddy: "Well, don't you sound brave all of a sudden?"
  - Gumption (bashful but determined): "Doesn't seem to be much point being anything else"
- Gumption (changing the subject): "Do you think Patient got its signal out?"
  - Maddy: "Dunno, but speaking of signal..." (first kiss)
- Commotion in the square and for a brief moment Maddy thought someone had seen them
- People pointing at the night sky as a light moves slowly against the stars
- It's the Makers' ship returning
