## Stolen Arms

Maddy was sketching the willow tree in the center of the village square
when she heard one of the Ox brothers holler,
"Mail's coming!"
*Finally*, she thought,
giving her drawing one last despairing look.
The branches were all in exactly the right places,
but somehow the lines on the page didn't look anything like
the drooping greenery in front of her.

She sighed and tucked her sketchbook and pencil into
the blue canvas satchel her father had made
for her tenth birthday—the last one she'd had
before he was kidnapped by marauding bots.
A lot had happened since then,
but at least now they knew he might still be alive.

"Waitin' on anything in particular?"
a familar voice drawled behind her.

Maddy jumped, startled.
Mayor Lupus smiled down at her from the porch behind her,
a mug of tea in her hand.
It was a kindly smile,
but it still showed a lot of wolfish teeth.
"Mama sent off for some seeds," Maddy said.
"And my chores were all done, and…"

"…and it's a beautiful sunny day so why not sit for a bit?"
the old wolf finished, nodding agreeably.
She jerked her chin toward Maddy's bag.
"You're getting a lot better.
Your pa would be pleased."

"Thank you," Maddy mumbled.
The mayor had a way of looking at people that made them feel like she could read their mind.
Special Leaf said that was a big part of why the village had re-elected her so many times:
just about everyone who might have run against her felt guilty just thinking about it.

They waited on the steps of the mayor's house as a handful of people gathered.
They shared the usual gossip and small talk as they waited.
Zeke the bear had finally finished fixing the wall of the smokehouse
that had been partly knocked down
during the bot attack a few months ago.
He still wasn't happy about the bots who'd helped save them living in the village,
"Not that they're actually 'living'," he added.
But even he would admit that Crusher could lift twice as much
as the Ox brothers put together.
And they were certainly handy for fixing things up in general—the apple orchard
was draining properly for the first time in who knew how long,
and there wasn't a dull pair of scissors in the whole village.

"I'd just feel more comfortable about it if they'd let us pay them,"
Mama Tumbly sighed.
"Makes me uncomfortable, taking charity from a bot."

Mayor Lupus swallowed the last of her tea
and tipped the dregs into the planter by her elbow.
"I reckon they figure being allowed to settle in beside us is payment enough," she said conversationally.
"Between that and getting a look at whatever salvage comes down the river,
I imagine they've got everything they want and a lot more than they used to.
And if any trouble shows up, well…"
She rapped her gnarlywood cane against her mechanical leg.
"Fighting bots is a lot easier when you have a few on your side."

Mama Tumbly's whiskers twitched slightly under the rebuke.
She had put herself forward for election the year before last,
but had garnered even fewer votes than Mayor Lupus's previous challenger.
"A lot of folks do think it's time for a change,"
Mama Roo had explained to Maddy afterward,
"But if Mama Tumbly is what that change looks like, they'd rather wait."

"Anyway, there it is, right on time,"
Mayor Lupus said, pointing as the mailbot came into view.
Eighty-Eight Able-Six ("but call me Able") looked like three metal boxes
perched preciously on top of one another
with a single small wheel up front
and two larger spoked cartwheels in the rear.
It only had one arm,
and like many of the bots who had come to Rusty Bridge
it had patches and welds from years of mending,
but somewhere along the way it had learned how to whistle.
Someone had made it a blue hat with a little tin badge,
and it was quite possibly the happiest bot in the world.

Able bumped across the cobblestones,
braked,
backed up,
turned,
and doffed its hat.
"Good morning, one and all," it said jauntily,
replacing its hat and reaching around to open a hatch in its side.
"Got letters, got parcels, even got a newspaper from Sandy Bend."
Its periscope eyes swivelled one way and another as it began handing out what it had brought.

Someone bumped Maddy's elbow.
"Hey,"
Gumption said.

"Hey," she said back.
He had slicked back his fur again like some of the older goats, she noticed.
It made them look tough,
but on Gumption—she sighed to herself.
It had taken him months to heal after the bots had attacked.
Once he was back on his feet he'd started using the punching bag
in the yard beside the village school
and doing militia drills with a home-made pike.
Secretly she had hoped that this would be the summer they went blackberry picking together,
just the two of them,
but "together" seemed to be the last thing on his mind.

Gumption jerked his chin at the mailbot.
"Anything for you?"

She was about to say, "Not yet,"
when Able called her name.
She traded a square glass penny for a letter in a plain brown envelope.
"Miz Madalena Roo, Resident in Rusty Bridge" was written in careful square letters on the front,
and a blue circle with Able's dot-and-dash ID inside it showed that it had been collected in good order.

Maddy took a deep breath.
"Well? You going to open it?"
Gumption asked.

She shook her head.
"Not here.
You want to go look in on Special Leaf?"

Gumption shrugged.
"Sure.
Sindy doing one of her special lessons?"

"Ssh!"
Maddy glanced around involuntarily,
but nobody was listening.
Only family and Gumption and a couple of bots knew about her sister's special ability,
and Special Leaf was adamant that they keep it that way as long as they could.
"Never borrow trouble from tomorrow," he had said firmly
when Mama Roo had suggested that they at least let the mayor know.

Gumption shrugged again.
"Sorry," he muttered,
and then,
"Hey—look!"

Heads turned.
A murmur ran through the crowd.
"What in tarnation?" Able whistled
as two bots entered the square
with a pair of muddy, sullen goats between them.

Dockety was in the lead,
its mis-matched arms swinging as it marched toward the crowd.
Its companion Crusher brought up the rear on its heavy treads,
and in between—

"Are those boys *tied up*?"
Mama Tumbly gasped,
her ears standing straight up in shock.

"Quiet down, all," Mayor Lupus said sharply as the murmuring turned to muttering.
The crowd parted to let her through,
her cane rapping on the cobblestones with every second step.

"Morning," she said loudly.
"I thought Able had brought all the mail,
but it seems like you have something for us as well."

The lenses on the front of Dockety's head rotated a quarter turn
and then snapped back into position
with a faint *zick zick*.
"These ones were apprehended
while attempting to take possession of items that do not belong to them,"
it said,
its voice buzzing slightly.
"We request punitive measures be taken to deter a repeat of such attempts."

Mayor Lupus sucked in her cheeks.
"Is that right, boys?
Were you stealing?"

"We weren't stealin'!"
Bluster said vehemently.
"We were just tryin' to find out if they've been hidin' stuff from everyone,
and we did!
They got weapons stashed away!
All kinds of them!"

"I said quiet down!" Mayor Lupus snapped as the muttering started again.
"That's a pretty serious accusation, Bluster Goat.
You best be sure of your ground before you go making it."

"Bravo seen 'em too," Bluster said.
His twin brother nodded vigorously.
"Big pile of stuff in one of those sheds they built,
all laid out with tools and wires and stuff."

"Those are not weapons,"
Dockety buzzed.
"They are spare parts.
Many of us still require repairs."

"Spare parts my tail!" Bluster said hotly.
"They got a thing looks like a zap gun,
and a buzz saw blade and all kinds.
They put 'em all together one night while we're sleepin'
and we'll all be in cage carts by sun-up!"

"Dockety?
Any of that true?"
the mayor asked.
Her tone was still light,
but Maddy saw the way her ears flattened.

The bot's lenses rotated back and forth.
"These ones possess several saw blades," the bot acknowledged.
It gestured at Crusher.
"This one has been using one of them to clear brush,
and it needed sharpening."

"And the zap gun?"

"It is not operational," Dockety said.
"But if we are able to repair it,
we will use it only for defensive purposes."

"Says *you*," someone said just loudly enough to be heard.

Mayor Lupus rapped her cane on the cobblestones.
"Operational or not,
it would have been neighborly of you to let us know you had that."

"Noted," Dockety said.

"And you two,"
the mayor continued,
turning a cold glare on the goat twins.
"It's not your business to be poking around in other folks' business.
No,
no,
don't interrupt me,
that's just going to make me cranky.
They all have just as much right to be here now as anyone,
and more than you do if you keep practicing nonsense like this.
You're both on ditch duty for the next month,
and if I sniff so much as a whiff of you doing something this lump stupid again,
I promise you'll be looking back on ditches like they were your first summer love.
You both have that straight?"

Bluster opened his mouth to protest,
but snapped it shut when Bravo kicked the side of his leg.
"Yes'm," he said sullenly.

"Yes'm," Bravo echoed.

"All right then.
Untie them—they won't bother you again."

"Thank you."
Bluster took an involuntary step back as Dockety spun around,
then glared at the bot as its mis-matched hands undid the knots
that held his arms in place.

"Let's get out of here," he snapped at his brother
once the other goat was free.
They stalked off side by side,
their boots clomping in time on the cobblestones.

"Those two make me *so* mad!"
Maddy grouched to Gumption as the crowd began to break up.
"They'd both be chained up in Heck or worse
if it weren't for Dockety."

"I guess,"
Gumption said noncommittally,
scuffing his boot on the cobblestones.

"You don't think so?"
Maddy demanded hotly.

"I didn't say that!"
Gumption protested.
"But—Mama Tumbly was by for tea yesterday,
and she and my ma and pa were all saying that
we don't really know much about them.
I'm not not saying I agree,"
he added hastily,
anticipating Maddy's outrage.
"But she was saying—Mama Tumbly, I mean—that they call us 'breathers'."

"Well we call 'em a lot worse than that,"
Maddy snapped.

Gumption threw up his hands.
"I don't!
I like having 'em here, you know that.
I'm just saying a lot of folks aren't as quick with change as you,
that's all."

They walked the rest of the way to Special Leaf's house in silence.
It was a warm day,
and other circumstances Maddy would have suggested taking the long way around
just so they could spend some time together,
but she was angry and it would have been awkward
and why did everything have to be so *complicated*?

She knocked on Special Leaf's front door
and opened it without waiting to be invited in.
The Special had already been old before Maddy and Gumption were born,
but the battle with the bots had put even more wrinkles on his green-gray skin.
His eyes were still bright behind his little round glasses,
though,
and he always seemed glad to see them.

"Done for the day?"
Maddy asked her sister,
ruffling the patch of fur on the top of Sindy's head.

"Just let me finish this chapter,"
Sindy pleaded without looking up.

"You're welcome to take it with you,"
Special Leaf said gently.

"But this is the most exciting part!
Please?"

Maddy looked at Gumption, who shrugged.
"Five minutes,"
Maddy said sternly.
Special Leaf caught her eye and nodded his head sideways toward the kitchen.

Maddy followed him into the other room.
"How's she doing?" she asked.

"Very well,"
the old tortoise said.
He fished a small metal-rimmed rectangle of black glass out of his pocket.
"I came by this up years ago.
Never knew if it was tech or just a paperweight,
but she was fiddling with it this morning
and all of a sudden it was full of pictures.
And not just any pictures,"
he added,
unable to keep the excitement out of his voice.
"They were all things from the book she was reading.
It was almost like it had been listening to her,"
he finished wistfully.

"That's great," Maddy said brightly,
though she still wasn't completely sure that it was.
Her sister was one of those rare people who didn't look like either of their parents.
She no tail,
no whiskers or scales,
and no fur except for a wiry black tuft on the top of her head.
When other children wanted to be cruel they called her a throwback,
but almost every piece of tech she touched responded to her.
Being able to use just one was enough for someone to be called "special".
Maddy was happy for her sister,
she really was,
but every time she thought about what would happen
when the rest of the village—when the rest of the *world*—found out,
her stomach went a little queasy.

Gumption elbowed her.
"Aren't you going to tell him?"

Special Leaf's forehead wrinkled,
which was as close as the tortoise could get to raising his eyebrows.
Maddy scowled sidelong at Gumption,
then reluctantly pulled the letter out of her satchel.
"Mm," Special Leaf said.
"I was wondering when that would arrive."
He opened the breadbox on the counter behind him,
took out a butternut cookie,
and offered it to Maddie.

"What's this for?" she asked.

"If it's good news, celebrating," Special Leaf said.
"And if it's not,
well,
a cookie won't fix anything,
but it won't make it worse either."

Gumption elbowed her again.
"Just open it."

Maddy swallowed drily.
With a sudden motion she tore the envelope open
and unfolded the single beige rectangle of paper inside.
Her face fell.
She blinked furiously,
angry at the sudden tears in her eyes.

"Aw, muck," Gumption said.
He patted her awkwardly on the shoulder.
"I'm sorry, Maddy."

She shook her head.
"No.
No.
They—"
She laughed shakily.
"They said yes.
They're going to publish it.
They're going to put my drawing in the newspaper!
Woo!"

She grabbed Gumption and hugged him impulsively,
then turned to Special Leaf and held out her hand.
"Congratulations," he said as she took an enormous bite out of the cookie.

## The Prosecutors

Gumption woke up the next morning
to the sound of raindrops
spattering on the leaves of the cottonwood outside his attic bedroom.
He lay on his narrow cot looking up at the sharply-peaked roof above his head
and thought,
*Of course.*
He was supposed to spend the morning weeding the vegetable garden.
It wasn't the worst job in the world,
but even if he wore his father's waxed cotton slicker
his fur would get soaked and muddy.

His stomach rumbled.
The gray light coming through the shutter on the attic's one small window
matched his mood perfectly.
He was happy for Maddy,
he really was.
She wanted to be an artist more than anything in the world.
Having one of her drawing published in a newspaper
was almost as a big a deal for her
as saving Rusty Bridge from a band of marauding bots.
It was great news,
and if it got her thinking about something other than
her bug-brained schemes to storm into Heck and rescue her father,
well,
that was great too.

But it also meant she was one day closer to leaving Rusty Bridge for somewhere better.
Somewhere bigger, anyway—somewhere with people as smart and as talented as she was.
He'd known since their first conversation about books at Special Leaf's house
that she'd be going some day.
That day had been getting closer
ever since she had confided in him about her sister.
They couldn't hide Sindy's special powers for much longer,
and once folks knew,
the whole family would be off to Headling or Port Rough or,
or—

His stomach rumbled again.
"Oh, shut up," he muttered,
kicking the blanket down to the foot of his cot and sitting up.
His breath caught in his throat as his ribs twinged.
Doctor Ganesh said he'd mended well,
but every once in a while he turned his head the wrong way
or reached for spoon
and something caught,
like a door sticking slightly before opening.

He dressed carefully and climbed six steps down the ladder
into the hallway below
as quietly as he could.
His little sister and brother were still asleep,
and he'd catch it if he woke them.
His hooves clicked softly on the stairs
as he went down to the main floor
where his mother and grandmother were peeling potatoes
while his father and one of his uncles cleaned, oiled, and reassembled
a set of box hinges.
Other families would have given the work to Dockety and his bots,
but other families could afford to.
Maddy's was one of the few that had to be as careful about making ends meet as Gumption's,
and sometimes,
late at night,
he wondered if they actually had anything more than that in common.

He had just put a pot of porridge on the stove
when something clattered outside.
His uncle looked up.
"That'll be Zeke headin' out,"
his father grunted,
but then a high-pitched voice squealed from upstairs.

"Mama!
Mama!
Outside!
Outside on the road!"

Gumption's mother opened the door.
Her hand flew to her mouth.
"What? What's going on?" Gumption asked,
squeezing past her to look.

His first thought was, *Bandits!*
But then the traveler in front,
a rabbit in a slouch hat with a long rifle over her shoulder
nodded to the goats.
Gumption's father raised a tentative hand to wave back.

The six-legged mulebot beside the rabbit had a squat turret for a head
and armor that put Special Leaf's shell to shame.
Behind them marched a tiger,
an actual tiger with a black patch over one eye and a sword slung on his hip.
A bear carrying almost as many weapons as the mulebot brought up the rear.
He wore the same dark green jackets with black collars and cuffs
as the rabbit and tiger,
while the mulebot was painted in matching camouflage.

A chill went up Gumption's spine.
They were Prosecutors,
and they were headed for Rusty Bridge.
*Sindy!* he thought.
Somehow they must have found out about Sindy.
He had to warn the Roos so they could—he didn't know what,
but *something*.

He squeezed back into the kitchen
just in time to trip over his little sister.
"Stay inside!" he ordered,
knowing she would disobey.

Ten steps and he was out the back door.
Twenty strides at a run and he was over the split cedar fence
that separated their farm from his second-uncle's.
A crow scolded him from a tree
as he swung himself over another fence
onto the dirt path that ran through the trees to town.
It was muddy from overnight rain but he didn't slow down,
not even when his feet almost went out from under him
on a slippery patch near a stream so small
that even the children didn't have a name for it.

*She's gonna be at home,*
he told himself.
Mama Roo did laundry and other chores for half a dozen families in town to make ends meet,
which meant she got up early even by farmers' standards,
but Maddy and Sindy only helped out a couple of days a week.
Gumption had no idea if today was one of those days or not.
If it was he'd have no idea where to start looking for them,
so all he could do was hope it wasn't.

He had to slow down and walk to catch his breath twice
before he reached town
and once more before he got to Maddy's.
He felt a bit nauseous from hunger,
and he was pretty sure he had a blister—his boots
weren't made for running—but
he pushed that aside and knocked on their door,
then knocked again, harder.

"Just a tick!" Mama Roo called from inside.
Gumption pushed the door open without waiting.

"What—oh, hello, Gumption," Mama Roo said,
wiping her hands on a dishcloth.
"I was just—what?
What's wrong?"

"P-Prosecutors,"
Gumption panted,
getting the word out on the second try.
"A bunch of Prosecutors just come up along Makers Road past our place
headin' toward town."
He waved more or less in the direction of Rusty Bridge.
"Miz Roo—what if they're comin' for Sindy?"

Mama Roo's eyes widened.
"Prosecutors?
Are you sure?"

Gumption nodded breathlessly.
"They were wearin' uniforms and carryin' all kinds of gear,
and Miz Roo,
one of 'em was a tiger,
an actual honest *tiger* with just one eye."

"Keep your voice down!"
Mama Roo pointed at the ceiling.
"The girls are still asleep."

"No I'm not."
Maddy slipped into the room as quietly as an actual mouse.
"But Sindy is.
What's this about Prosecutors?"

Gumption quickly described the travelers.
"And he had an eyepatch, just like in the stories,"
he finished.

"That doesn't mean—"
Maddy started,
stopping when her mother raised a hand.

Mama Roo gnawed her lip for a moment.
"Aright," she said.
"Special Leaf said this day would come,
so I guess it's here.
Maddy,
you head into town and find out what you can.
I'll stay here with Sindy 'til we know more.
Gumption,
I can't ask you to do any more than you have, but—"

"I'll go with her,"
he said before Mama Roo could finish.
He forced a grin that he hoped was reassuring.

Mama Roo nodded.
"Thank you," she said,
and then to Gumption's embarrassment she kissed the top of his head.
"Thank you for everything.
And you,"
she continued briskly to her daughter.
"You are going straight back upstairs and combing your fur
before you go anywhere."

Five minutes and one whispered argument
about whether Maddy should wear a coat in case the rain came back
and the two teenagers were out the door.
Mama Roo had given Gumption one of yesterday's biscuits
with some hummus and fresh-picked lettuce on it.
He ate it in three bites,
wishing he had some tea to wash it down,
but there would be time for that later.

"We should stop by Special Leaf's and get him on the way,"
Maddy said suddenly.

"Sure," Gumption nodded.
He definitely had a blister,
but there'd be time for that later too.
"They could just be passin' through, you know."

"They could,"
Maddy acknowledged.
The tone of her voice made clear
just how likely she thought that was.

Special Leaf wasn't home,
or was sleeping so soundly that he couldn't hear them knocking.
"We could just go in an' see if he's here,"
Gumption suggested.

Maddy hesitated, then shook her head.
"Let's just head down to the square.
Whatever's going to happen is going to happen there."

They reached the square moments before the Prosecutors.
A double handful of townspeople had already gathered—Gumption
wasn't the only one who'd run ahead and spread word.
Mayor Lupus stood on the porch of the mayor's house
with her gnarlywood cane in her hand
and a serious expression on her face.
She had pinned both of her medals on her jacket as well,
Gumption noticed.
The last time she had done that had been
when she exiled one of the town bears for a year
for getting drunk and stabbing the older Ox brother
with a pitchfork.

The sun broke through the clouds for a moment
just as the Prosecutors arrived.
When Gumption thought about them afterward,
that was always the image that first came to mind.
They had formed up in pairs:
the one-eyed tiger and the rabbit in front
with the bear and the mulebot behind them.
The sunlight brought out the stains and damp patches on their uniform jackets,
but somehow that made them more intimidating rather than less.

When they were ten steps away from the steps of the mayor's house
the tiger whistled,
short and sharp.
The Prosecutors took two more steps each and halted,
still in formation.
A low murmur ran through the townspeople.
Someone shushed a new arrival.

"Morning," Mayor Lupus said,
inclining her head.
"And welcome to Rusty Bridge.
Been a while since we had official visitors."

"My apologies on that, miz mayor,"
the tiger replied cordially,
lisping slightly.
"Too many places to be and too few of us to be in them all.
You know how it is."

"No apologies needed, Special…?"
She flicked an ear to make it a question.

"Blazes," the tiger supplied.
"Special Blazes, miz mayor, at your service."

The crowd let out its collective breath.
"I *told* you," someone said,
just loud enough to be heard.
Someone else shushed them.

Gumption just stared,
Maddy and Sindy and everything else momentarily forgotten.
Special Blazes was *famous*.
Every story in the newspaper about his exploits said so:
"The famous Special Blazes has triumphed again!"
The Case of the Snorkeling Smugglers,
the Shootout at Half a Hat,
his year-long pursuit of the villainous Mattock sisters—Gumption
had read all of them and more.

He turned to Maddy,
opening his mouth to say, "It's him! It's really him!"
But then he saw the scowl on her face
and settled for, "Um, gosh," instead.

"Well,
Special,
it's an honor to have you here,"
Mayor Lupus said,
pitching her voice to carry.
"There's rooms inside for all of you
for as long as you need them.
Oh,
and may I introduce Special Leaf?"

The elderly tortoise had somehow made his way to the front of the crowd
without anyone around him particularly noticing.
He had put on a sweater,
a thick, shapeless gray one that Mama Bear had knit for him the winter before last,
and had an old blue scarf wrapped around his neck as well.
He peered at the Prosecutors through his little round glasses
as if trying to decide whether they were books that needed to be shelved.

Special Blazes dipped his head deferentially.
"It's truly an honor, Special," he rumbled.
Beside him,
the rabbit doffed her hat and dipped her head as well.

"Thank you,"
Special Leaf said in a slightly fuddled tone.
"If you,
um,
well,
if you'd like tea at some point,
you'd be very, um…"
He gestured vaguely in the direction of his house.

Special Blazes dipped his head again.
"Thank you, Special," he said respectfully.
"I think what we'd like most right now is a chance to wash up."

The mulebot made a grinding noise.
The corner of Special Blazes' mouth quirked.
"Or a wipe down and a bit of oil, if there's any to be had,"
he amended.
"And miz mayor,
if you can spare a bit of time for conversation,
we'd be grateful for that as well."

And just like that the little show was over.
Mayor Lupus waved the three flesh-and-blood Prosecutors inside
while the mulebot followed Zeke around back
to the building's other covered porch.
The townspeople milled about for a few moments,
but when the sky started spitting again
they decided in ones and twos that their chores weren't going to do themselves
and headed for home.

"You ever seen a Prosecutor before?"
Gumption asked Special Leaf.
"I mean, you must have," he corrected himself immediately.

The Special nodded.
"Not in some years," he said quietly,
all traces of fuddlement gone from his voice.

"Do you think—"
Maddy started.

"Sh."
The old tortoise shook his head slightly,
his eyes on the mayor's house.
"Don't know what to think yet,
so no point talking of what-ifs and maybes.
Especially not here,"
he added,
nodding slightly toward a small group of people still gossipping nearby.
"But if I may offer some advice?"

"Sure."
"'Course."
Gumption and Maddy said together when he paused for an answer.

Special Leaf adjusted his glasses.
"Be very, very careful what you say,
especially around Blazes.
He's every bit as smart as the stories say,
but he is not your friend."

## The Mouse and the Gears

Gumption went home after that—Prosecutors or no Prosecutors, he had chores to do.
Maddy walked part of the way with him in silence
before grunting a "see you later" and turning right instead of left where the path forked.

The excitement of knowing that the *Sandy Bend Chronicle* was going to publish her drawing had worn off,
leaving her feeling as drizzly and gray inside as the weather was outside.
It had been stupid to think that that the Prosecutors would just march into Rusty Bridge and say,
"We're taking Sindy Roo,"
without some kind of—of she didn't know what.
A trial or something,
but they would just *take* her.
And if they had,
what could she have done anyway?

"Let's figure out what's what before we worry about that," Mama Roo said firmly
when Maddy was done blurting this all out at the kitchen table.
"I have to talk to the Deers about that family portrait they want touched up
now that Eldon's antlers are coming in,
so I'll stop by Special Leaf's on the way back and see if he knows anything more.
Meanwhile,
you have a visitor."

Something warbled under the table.
Maddy felt a tentative poke at her ankle and smiled despite herself.
