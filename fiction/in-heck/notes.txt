## To Do

- Fix first story so that the thing in the swamp comes together out of snake-like parts
- cryonades (freezing grenades)

## Characters

- Sindy Roo: Madica's 10-year-old sister who can use all kinds of tech

- Mama Roo: their mother
  - The postmistress, schoolteacher, and portrait painter of Rusty Bridge
- Papa Roo: their father
  - Was a mechanic despite prejudice that only raccoons and monkeys could be good ones
  - Taken four years ago during a thiever raid
- Gumption Gruff: a 12-year-old goat
  - Madica's best friend
  - Loves books, which makes him odd for a goat
- Special Leaf: a 200-year-old tortoise
  - Now coaching Sindy Roo as she explores her talent

  - Taken over by the Gears
- The Gears
  - A swarm bot that claims to live in the cracks and crevices of Heck
  - Turns out to be part of Central
- Central: the computer that runs Heck
  - Doing maintenance until the Makers return
- ARM 47: an Autonomous Robotic Manipulator
  - Central's minions and prison guards
- ARM 15: smaller Central-controlled bot
- Patient in Darkness: the villain from the first book
  - Winds up taking over Central

## Ideas

- Bluster and Bravo caught trying to steal weapons from the bots who are now living in Rusty Bridge
  - Regulators come down hard on the bots rather than the thieves
  - Special Leaf observes that the Regulators don't seem to mind that the breathers have weapons
  - Special Blazes doesn't like being challenged
- Dockety is the unofficial leader of the bots
  - "Patient will return. We will defend ourselves. And you."
- Explains that it saw Papa Roo working some ancient machines
  - "Some will only work for the living, and not even for all of them"
  - Find out later that there are genetic markers that only a few breathers have
- Story ends with Patient taking over Central as a message arrives from deep space that the Makers are returning
- Rusty Bridge "breathers" fear their new bot neighbors
  - Set up near the charging pillar a few minutes outside of town
  - Helping with farmwork and fixing the road
  - Zeke the bear grumbles the most, and doesn't take kindly to jokes that it's because he's no longer the strongest
- a whiff of BLM
  - the Regulators are supposed to be impartial
  - clearly biased toward breathers, even though some of them are bots themselves
- rescue Papa Roo
  - "It's hopeless"
  - "Maybe not with a luck special"
  - "You are not going to risk your life!"
  - "You can't stop me."
- keeping Sindy's powers secret so she isn't "recruited" by the Regulators
  - "You wouldn't be sleepin' rough like us. You'd be in the Governor's mansion makin' sure things went right."
  - "What if I don't want to be?"
  - Blazes' ears went back. "You didn't earn this gift, so it ain't rightly yours."
- romance between Maddy and Gumption
  - inter-species romances are common among teens, but most folk settle down with their own kind
  - Gumption's mother is a goat, but his father is a sheep
  - Gets teased (bullied) for having mixed parentage
  - "Doctors and donors and it's kind of personal so how about we don't talk about it?"
  - Except Mama Roo brings it up as gently as she can with Maddy, who really (really) doesn't want to talk about it
- Central and Special Blazes are mirror images of each other
  - both believe the ends justify the means
- the Regulators include a bot and a cyborg
  - not just about protecting people from bots
  - "There are plenty of bad breathers out there as well" says the bot (gets smacked for using the word)
- Special Blazes sneers that other tortoises have served as Regulators
  - turns out Special Leaf used to be a Regulator but left because he lost faith in what they were doing
- Special Leaf sacrifices himself in the end to destroy Central
  - tells Sindy it's good luck not bad: "always wanted... to be useful..."
- the Makers' enormous ship enters orbit at the end
