## General Ideas

Prayer is prompt engineering for gods.
(Ours cashed out and is on a beach somewhere.)
That's why legacy languages.

The last fireworks show (before everything switches to drones).

Break down the wall of a cellar and find that it's free-standing in the
middle of an enormous cave.

Jellied blood cheese is a delicacy in Uws.

Mirrors in the great halls of Ruuda reflect sunlight everywhere;
initially for defense, but the technology is now exported.

Only the purest dayglass-stored sunlight is effective against the
undead.

Come up with a more refined name for the undead, based on "patchwork".

The four foods in the desert are bread, wine, salt, and dates. In Uws,
chocolate is so precious that it is only drunk at weddings.

A herd of wilkies---big toms (males) and their susans (females).

The wandering screw pine (sends down shoots to propagate itself, so that
it slowly "walks" across the swamp).

Screwthorn and knucklethorn plants.

Gingepper and sharp lime are two spices exported from Barra Bantang.

Juan di Per√ßalle was a gardener; many reflectories contain elaborate
gardens in different styles; "prayer" consists of asking to be like a
saint (question is, asking who? many people have observed the human
tendency to ask, and consider it a legacy of the Angel Days).

There are railways consisting of bamboo tracks, with carts pulled by
elephants or rhinos.

There are no tides in Cherne, but the water level did drop when Plangent
fell into the sea, and has been sinking very slowly ever since.

Have characters comment on the "chosen one" theme --- it's an
excuse for normal people not to act.

Using vinegar and a wire brush to artificially age oak.

Servants ducking and dodging behind the nobility to hold up their
elaborate cloaks as they dance outdoors.

The theorbo and turlutaine are ancient musical instruments.

Carve a chain out of a single piece of stone, delicately chipping away
until the links are free of one another.

The Ship of All Years is the funeral boat.

Under Uwsian law, men must build their own pyres (or dig their own
graves?) before being executed.

The fishermen of northern Plangentia are very fond of hot spices to
drive away the damp.

The fashion for pottery in southern Plangentia is a simple vase with
clean lines, encrusted with natural-seeming growths (sometimes as
elaborate as entire branches with birds perched on them).

The "game of stones" is Go.

A painter at a reflectory made a mural of the sins and distractions, and
was thoughtful enough to leave space for new ones.

Heliomancy is the art of telling the future by interpreting the dazzle
left in one's eyes by staring at the sun. It exacts its price
automatically...

People who stare into the sun until they're blinded by it as proof of
the strength of their faith. (Garheimmen) Perhaps part of what's
happening in Cherne is that religion is appearing?

Spoons made of clam shells with fitted bone handles.

In Thind, the background figures in a tableau are painted on the wall;
the minor ones are in semi-relief, and the major ones are free-standing
statues. People notice you more if you're a statue, but you also get
crapped on more by the birds.

A scale maker.

The sand gave way to a landscape of black pebbles, left behind by some
broad river of ancient days, covered and uncovered by each change of the
wind.

Merchants loosen the ties on bundles of wool, so that sand will get in
and increase the weight.

"You're running around like a cat with a sock on its head."

Several merchants crept away before dawn, hoping to reach the market
before the rest of the caravan. The others found their bodies in a
gorge, their camels and goods stolen.

A safe-deposit shop (instead of a bank).

Married to the horizon.

Their homes are half-buried; the only entrance is through the smokehole
in the roof.

The killer left two coins to be put on the victim's eyes; in order to
ensure that they wouldn't be stolen, he left them in the victim's
throat.

People's remains are buried in clay ossuaries after the birds have
picked them clean.

A seesaw hat.

As dumb as a house.

It's cold---but at least it's a dry cold.

Cherubs are a kind of bird.

A caravan lost forever in a perpetual storm in the Karaband (the
Wandering Dutchman); it tries to seduce/recruit unwary travelers.

"I lost a few pounds when ill, as one would throw a bone to a wild
animal to keep it at bay."

Manure collectors in the streets.

Loose cobblestones with water trapped between them that shoots up when
they're stepped on. It's particularly disgusting in the fishmarket.

The poor sleep near kilns to keep warm, which makes the bakery, glass,
and brick districts rough places to be after dark.

Tailors have hunched backs, as do silversmiths.

"Every movement that seeks to change society faces two great tasks. The
first is to discredit the old order. The second is to offer a new one.
Without the assurance of a new order, the debate becomes a choice
between order and chaos, and order wins." (William Saletan, in the New
York Times Book Review, Sept 26, 2004)

Fish speckled with luminescent spots to attract prey who are themselves
luminescent dots looking for a school.

Crabs dig shallow holes to hide their shadows on the sand.

Are some animals odorless in order to avoid detection (i.e. as a form of
crypsis)? If so, how would we (humans) know?

The sun used to fly directly over the middle of the world. Now it has
slipped south (actually, the world has tilted), so the north has frozen,
while the south has dried up. The sun doesn't move north or south
through the year; instead, it grows hotter and hotter, day by day, until
midsummer, then cooler until midwinter. It rises white-hot in the east,
and cools through the day to orange-red by evening, so that the
southeast is the hottest part of the world, and the northwest the
coldest. In Garheim, there is a courtyard with one piece of dayglass
tuned exactly to the color of the sun at mid-day on each day of the
year.

...her voice weighted down with a lifetime of asking little, but
getting less.

They believe that the last person to arrive at a funeral will be the
next do die. They know it doesn't usually happen, but that doesn't
stop them believing it.

People keep a chip of stone from the house they're born in as a lucky
charm; hang it around their neck when they're grown.

A "deliverer" is someone who negotiates for the return of hostages
taken during war.

"He's the kind of guy who'd kick a donkey to make it go, then kick it
again 'cuz it wasn't going fast enough, then keep on kicking it
because he'd discovered he liked to."

Cats with their tufts of hair like eyebrows; Piaerre talking to one,
hoping that it will talk back (just like every other kid in Cherne did
at some point); Piaerre overhearing Vurt talking to himself, thinking
that his grandfather is talking to spirits, and only later realizing
that it was just the mutterings of a lonely old man.

Storing knowledge likes bees store honey: workers go out and find it,
bring it back to the hive, but instead of regurgitating honey, they
regurgitate odd facts, which are stored away in honeycomb library cells.

Assassin was turned to stone to sneak him into the palace; stayed that
way for centuries until the spell finally wore off, and found himself in
a world that had changed out of all recognition.

Eimin's bag is reversible: when he buys it, comment in passing on its
plain brown lining, obviously recycled from an older bag. Later, he
reverses the bag and throws off his robe to disguise himself.

"Hive art" is a long, slow art. A man might make twenty or thirty
pieces in a lifetime, starting each when the one before was not even
half finished. The trick is to paint wood with just enough sugar to
attract a few workers, so that you can control their building.

Razi says "eyes what you can" or "ears!", instead of "see what you
can" or "listen!"

Eimin brings Hediyeh back down to the goat pasture, and sends one of the
little girls to Medef for help. There's no investigation or trial;
that's not how villages work, and anyway, everyone can *drome* his
guilt.

Scene after Thomas trades away his interest in women for power: Masika
is available (i.e. shows that she's interested in Eimin). Razi talks
about carrying three books on his travels, and picking which one to read
based on who was nearby (trying to bond with Eimin). Eimin is
embarrassed by the attempt at intimacy. They go out to practice with
swords (blade no wider tha three fingers together, not like pictures in
books at all). Eimin remembers that his first sword was wooden, and felt
heavy. Razi explains that a sword isn't a good weapon for a spy, or a
thief: it's too big, and besides, real soldiers have more practice with
them anyway. Important to get across Razi's feeling of duty: this is
what our people need from us, this is what we can do for them, perhaps
this is why we're born *nif*. (Foreshadow insinuation that maybe being
*nif* isn't accidental.) Reveal in this scene that Eimin's parents are
separated (split when he was seven). Don't make a big deal of it at
this point...

Eimin is offered magic by his host, but Aphsi don't do magic---don't
have enough fire in their bellies.

Pawns in chess can become important just by being the focus of
attention. The pawn itself doesn't matter, or the location, it's just
where both sides are building up their strength.

Put dried plums in meat to slow down spoiling.

A blue-headed duck.

The *Wonderfish*.

A small, round clay flute called an ocarina.

A calligrapher's assistant working next door to a pewtersmith.

The red veins in rosewood.

The end of the monastery jutted out on a spur of rock like the prow of a
ship.

Each wave has its own name; they are born and die every instant. It may
seem short and pointless, but what are we to trees, or trees to the
mountains?

People cleaning a floor, and the boss says, "Start in the corners."
It's harder, and people complain, but when they make mistakes and
scratch things, the scratches are out of the way.

Story starts with the boy's mother saying, "Oh, I wish you knew how
much I love you," as she send him off to school for three years. He
starts to cry and says, "I wish I did too," then adds to the reader,
"But of course that was the whole problem. I couldn't." Then explain
droming and being snel. (His parents are travelling --- one year to
cross the Glasslands, a few weeks of work, then the long wait to travel
back in the windless season.) While he's at the school, a master thief
tries to persuade him that he has special powers that he doesn't know
about. She starts by talking about how one day people will be able to
fly, without magic or clouds or dragons to ride on. When the boy scoffs,
she says, "But people didn't used to know how to swim. They would have
thought it was magical, that someone could go into the water and not
drown. Imagine how much courage that took. Imagine what the world would
be like if someone had learned, and then decided that no-one else should
know. It would be as if someone had learned how to teach everyone to
drome, then decided not to." The thief is trying to presuade him to
steal some old books and tools from the school; she doesn't outright
tell the boy that he has special powers (that would be too obvious), but
instead says that the only way to find out is to get the stuff and try.

A breeze came up, and for a moment she thought the swaying branches of
the trees were waving goodbye, but then she pushed the thought out of
her head. It was a crazy thought, and she wasn't crazy any more.

"A Popsicle for the King" --- a story about two of the cloudherds
taking ice to the capital for the king's birthday present?

She woke up on her wedding day and burst into tears, because her
grandmother and her aunts had stayed up all night sewing fresh rose
petals onto her wedding dress.

"Just because they can sense that you're hurt doesn't mean they
won't hurt you --- some people learn to savor the pain of their
enemies the way other people savor the smell of strong cheese."

He remembers being stabbed in the belly, and wanting to run away from
the pain, or shake it off, as if it were an animal biting him or someone
wrestling him.

Man counting sheep --- comes up with nine or ten because he has
counted some several times. Try to explain, "But that's not right, you
can only count each sheep once," and he asks, "Why?"

Remove Tzen Ma from "The Last Wolf", and have only one undead
character (the Wrestler); is he trying to destroy himself, or is the
shaman doing it? Lara challenges Evan's peacemaking role: "What would
you have done about Prince George?" Still need to work in the last
wolf; what's her role?

Everyone takes off their boots, then tucks their laces into the boot
tops to keep them dry.

His humor had grown dark and bitter, like tea that had steeped too
long...

One little fact stuck in his mind like a raspberry seed between his back
teeth.

Epiphyte: seed falls on a fungus that is parasitizing a tree, and
consumes the fungus (but not too quickly, because that would also kill
the epiphyte). Shoots hang down to find other fungi; it's a slow
wrestling match. Some epiphytes re-root themselves over and over again,
walking through the forest in slow motion, a lifetime at a step.
Epiphytes are trees' friends, but would disappear if the fungi they
consume disappeared, so they are never too efficient...

A battle called Harald's Lesson...

Sawgrass.

Blood is dark green under water.

Someone who has grown up undersea would think that birds were like quick
fish.

Floating upside down and backward makes you feel like you're flying
over the moon, like the first Apollo astronauts.

The Bellringers tried to control time by making clocks that make all
days the same length. Joke about everyone getting up at the same time,
no matter who they were. It's unnatural, and made everyone feel tired
all the time...

The Admirals' Game (one five, two fours --- what to use instead of
mines?). It's like chess, but more like real life, because you can't
see what the piece's strength is until you meet it.

Those who can "hear" refer to people who can't as "garbage",
because they "smell" (i.e. their emotions are always evident). It's
very rude...

He worked in the ivory mines (a graveyard of ancient creatures).

There's another, old, chunky boy who's also "deaf". He's been
selected to become the clan's butcher. He has always tormented the
protagonist, just as he's tormented other children (or tried to ---
they can get away from him, because they can "hear" him coming ---
the protagonist is selected for training because he's taught himself
how to be unnoticeable). When the protagonist is selected, the older boy
is angry and almost tearful: now he really is alone. The protagonist
feels guilty, and says, "I'll come back and get you, and we can go
away somewhere," even though they've never really been friends. The
older boy says, "No you won't, no you won't," and runs away on the
verge of tears. Later, the protagonist hears that the older boy has
"fallen" off one of the spires. He starts to ask, "What was he doing
up there?" but then he realizes that no-one ever goes up there to play
(it was suicide).

End a chapter with the child injured. Start the next with, "He must
have fallen asleep, although he didn't really remember waking. The
light was different --- clearer, somehow, as though everything was
transparent, although it wasn't." It takes the reader a few moments to
realize that the boy is dead.

Parents love their "deaf" children, but since they can't "hear"
their parents' soothing thoughts, they cry a lot, and are very trying,
so they are sent to be raised by one of the old women (it's an
established role in the clan). The protagonist therefore starts life
feeling rejected.

Discussions with the old woman are like therapy: she can tell when the
boy is lying, so she gently says, "But that's not true, is it?"
whenever he tries to fudge a point. Has to be clear that it's not
really for his benefit, but for the benefit of those who can "hear":
he's being trained to control his emotions, and not to let his ache
show.

Scene in the city where an old woman needs a seat on the ferry boat, and
the young girls won't get up to give her one, and then she falls when
the boat stumbles. The old woman hurts herself, and as the protagonist
is helping her up, the old woman says, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry," in a
miserable voice. The protagonist sits down beside his teacher, and then
says out loud, "I want to hurt them," just as if he was back with the
old woman. He speaks as if he and his teacher were the only ones in the
boat. "I want to hurt them. That old woman --- they could have stood
up, and given her a seat, and then she's apologizing when she falls
down. It wouldn't have been a big thing to let an old woman rest for a
few moments, but all they can think about is that she has wrinkles and
her hair's thinning and no-one can make them stand up. I want to throw
my tea in their faces, or hurt them so that they'll learn better." The
girls have gone pale with fear, but the protagonist's teacher calmly
says, "But that won't make them any better than they are, will it? You
could do all that, and they still wouldn't see how ugly they are
inside. They still wouldn't understand that you get up to give an old
woman a seat because it's the right thing to do, not because it's a
rule or because people make you. If you hurt them, all they will learn
is that sometimes people hit you and you can't hit back. That will be
what they each their children, so their children will grow up to be just
as ugly as they are."

The protagonist explaining that he sometimes dreams about rescuing
someone from drowning. (He's never seen someone drown, but he has read
about it --- talk about him imagining what it would be like to swim.)
His teacher says, "Then you're not really imagining doing good, are
you? Because if you wanted to imagine doing good, you'd imagine
preventing someone from drowning. What you're imagining is being seen
as a hero."

Looking at a man with ragged teeth, wondering what it would feel like to
run a tongue over them from the inside, whether you'd get used to it
and stop noticing, or whether you would just never have noticed.

Replacing bones with diamond glass.

Long Ash, Ash Mock, the Ash Hand (dwarf place names).

"Different people believe a lot of different things happen to us when
we die. We believe that you have to tell your story --- your whole
life's story --- before you can move on. Telling it to the village
rememberer is just a way of practicing. It doesn't have to be an
exciting story. It doesn't have to have lots of rescues and daring
escapes. But it ought to mean something to you. It ought to be a story
you want to hear again, one that you'll enjoy, because what would be
the point of having a life that even you didn't want to hear about?"

Shaking off the dregs of his dream.

Little whispers of smoke.

"You can spend your whole life being angry. You can be thirty years
old, and still daydream about somehow waking up knowing kung-fu when you
were twelve and giving the bully who used to shove you around in the
playground some of his own back. You can have angry conversations with
the mirror, or in the shower, when you're all alone, every single day
from now until you die. Or you can let it go. It's up to you. No-one
will choose for you. No-one can make you do it. It's up to you."

"There's monsters out there, boy. There's cobble haunts and ghouls
that'll rend you to shreds just for the smell of you. Me and mine are
all that keeps them out the door, and we *will* keep them out whether
you feed us or no, whether you give us a bed or no, but god's love on
this earth, I don't think a pint and a chew of bread is asking more
than's fair."

Man who built a little house on a hill so that he could watch the slow
decay of the mansion he'd grown up in.

The "villain" is a man whose only child was killed accidentally (just
stepped out in front of a carriage, nobody's fault, just a moment in
time). Not a moment has gone by since when he hasn't heard the sound of
the carriage wheels. His wife grieved herself into an early grave: would
burst into tears at random moments, and finally just gave up. Now he
wants to make that moment never have happened. "Even if I can't bring
my son back, I just want it to have never been." The problem is that if
that moment disappears, then everyone loses continuity. Nothing else
will change, but we won't be who we were before that moment. Our
stories won't be stories about *us*, but about people with the same
names and faces. Our memories will still all be there, but they won't
be *our* memories, they'll be stories that someone else told us. It's
the difference between having the bowl you grew up with, and having an
identical bowl that was someone else's.

Bubbles from the Royal Birthday Party that were enchanted so that they
would never pop --- still find them in corners, or blowing around the
city, and she wonders whether they'll become objects of wonder in
far-away lands, and whether the magic items in the castle were once
someone's birthday present.

The Truth Mines and the Pebble Factory.

Feeding dyed grains to birds to give them color.

The Scour is the wind that blows across the glass; scour is the grit
that it blows up into people's faces (need goggles to protect eyes). A
scourboat is a lightweight wheeled cart with sails.

"The deeper the weed, the brighter it grows." People live in the
valleys formed in the cracks in the glass; water is channeled into
brackish lakes, unless it can find an outlet, or evaporate quickly
enough.

He shows up unshaven; the aunt says rather tartly, "I suppose personal
grooming isn't so important to some people," and he replies, "Less
important than good manners," then holds her gaze until she colors and
looks away. Need a later scene where the guy's girlfriend says,
half-admiring, half-scolding, "I can't believe you said that! I never
think of things like that until it's too late!" He replies, "Maybe
that's why you have more friends than I do."

Sea water in the north becomes viscous, like mercury, as it approaches
freezing.

A Carnival of Hammers.

Prince wearing four ribbons, on legs as well as arms, now that he's a
cavalry officer. (On legs so that infantry can see more clearly.)

Need a fast ship to come down the sound before word of the voyage can
travel.

Magician with the power to understand what the wind is saying. Some
breezes sigh, "Lost... lost...", while some storms are blustering,
bragging bullies.

Thoughts sprouted in his head like weeds.

All the different kinds of white in an iceberg, and all the colors that
seemed forever ready to burst out of the white, but never quite did.

Add a kite-flying scene to "Tornado", and another to "Wolf" ---
some things should be done one last time, knowing that it's the last
time.

A plump girl who loves the feeling of ribbons in her hands, and loves to
play with the ends of brightly-colored threads, imagining them dancing
like willow-graceful ladies, twirling around at a ball, with candles in
glass lanterns and an orchestra and a polished tile floor beneath a
chandelier. Her father sits in his chair, an empty teacup going cool in
his lap, imagining all the great speeches he'll never give, the calls
to arms and denunciations of injustice and noble, self-sacrificing
farewells.

Red snow (seeds blown into it, year after year).

"Lamping" (lighting a small fire, then shooting the animals that come
to investigate it).

No danger of clouds freezing when they go north in "Wolf"; they're
used to the mountains.

Metal smoking condensation when it's brought indoors.

Married couple has to leave the village for a few days, so that everyone
can re-decorate the house that they are to share. Often do this before
the wedding (which sometimes leads to weddings being cancelled, but
that's not necessarily a bad thing either).

This year's law (the assembly only passes one per year).

The boy asks the tinsmith why he isn't married, and taps a vein of
sadness. It wasn't that there was someone, long ago, it's that there
was many people who were not quite right, or maybe he was hoping that
someone better would come along, and kept hoping, and always managed to
find fault with those who were available, until he discovered that he
had walled up that part of himself so well to guard against loneliness
that he couldn't find his way back in even if he wanted to. His
friendship with the boy is an attempt to sneak into that place.

One mosquito is an annoyance, but a hundred is something that you just
have to put up with. (Allegory about bandits: one is hunted down, but
large numbers are treated as a fact of life.)

The tribe's eulogist must learn everyone's life, so that s/he can lead
a proper funeral service. When the 'deaf' boy is to be sent away, the
first he knows is when the eulogist gently tells him that he no longer
needs to make his weekly visit (like confession).

The fact that they can sense people's emotions doesn't make them any
nicer, just subtler. (Correct the misconception that outsiders have in
imagining that empathy will create a perfect society: does living in a
rich land make you all charitable?)

Events erode the future, or shake it up, in the way that rivers and
earthquakes erode and shake up a landscape.

"I've had my ache of widows..." (Make the language in "Clouds" and
other novels slightly strange to the ear...)

"A wolf is kept fed by his feet."

The rents are low in hell.

The moon is a faded blue color, or "As blue as the moon," or "She had
moon-blue eyes."

The Bellmakers toil in silence, so that when the bell first speaks, it
will speak with its own voice. Each bell is then named according to the
prophecy it made.

Observatories take the place of cathedrals; the Garheimmen have very
good calendars.

The ritual of nicking the throat of the oldest man present at the start
of the fall slaughter of sheep.

The official palace thief.

Fear tastes like a rusty knife.

Islands rising out of the sea like mountain peaks rising out of the
clouds (and then later reverse the image).

Bloodfish.

A small tarn that a glacier had scraped out when it curled up and slept
for a few thousand years.

Sailors see a man standing on the ocean, bobbing gently up and down as
the waves rise and fall beneath his feet. (Travels by standing on the
leading edge of a wave and letting it push him.)

Ruby trees (plant 'em, their roots go way down and pull up gemstones.)

"May your fields be full of plowbane."

He grumbled, but built a stand so that Gram wouldn't have to bend over
to tie up her shoes.

"Babiest"

The prince's grandfather was called "Deaf King Edward", because he
never took advice from anyone.

"That's like asking which side of the coin is the 'real' one."

He was always willing to say, "I'm at fault," but it was always
followed immediately by "but" or "however".

Nosewax

The crown of Ini Bantang is cursed: whoever wears it can never be
satisfied with what they have or what they do. Of course, anyone who
thinks the crown is worth wearing is probably already cursed in that
way...

Volcanos are used to forge replacement parts for the Universal
Mechanism. People complain about having to suffer the effects of
accidents (i.e. eruptions), but the dwarves reply that it's an
unavoidable cost. (Analogy with nuclear power and other issues.)

When re-doing "Clouds" with older children, make it explicit that
puberty brings on mind-speech.

In cultures that only occasionally see clouds, "riding a cloud" means
"living in a dream". Even further away, it means "being drugged".

You have to keep good luck in motion: if you try to hang onto it, it'll
turn sour.

The breeze blows uphill in the morning, and down in the evening, as if
the mountain tops were inhaling and exhaling once a day.

The king is a carpenter, and Prince Evan is a kitemaker, while his
brother rides. (Some comment about nobles trying to learn one skill or
the other depending on who's in favor.)

Pikas and Pinemartens (a board game).

Mention the weather a lot more: skies, temperature, wind, how quickly
the mountains cool off, and how warm the plains stay in summer even
after the sun has gone down.

Mention the soldier dolls outside each home in Apple Bridge.

The difference between the pine needles of the mountains, and the broad
leaves of the trees on the plains, is that the former are a lot tougher.
"Aye," says Sergeant Crimes, "But the wood is softer."

Taiga (boreal forest).

Fallen trees act as dams, creating small pools.

The Anuat mistrust the Garheimmen language. In Anuat, there is no way to
say, "It is raining," because there is no "it". They believe that
Garheimmen was invented so that people could duck responsibility.

Anuat word for Garheimmen ships means "wooden whale".

"I could write and write and write, and to these people I'd still be
the little boy who always picked his nose in class."

If "Clouds" is re-written, then use the beast that the wizard's
mother defeated, rather than lightnings (because the latter violate the
proscription of using clouds and others as weapons).

"White blood".

Wattenaska is a Dantiwaw name (someone confuses it with Anuat).

So rich that he didn't care if others were.

A card game called Ducky Ace.

The Bridge of Dead Princesses, the Apparent Bridge (so-called because
it's apparently never finished).

"All men shall be sailors until the sea shall free them."

The prince feels that he's letting people down: his father by giving up
the throne, Sgt. Crimes, etc.

"You'll be grease!"

Nailsmith Road

"Blood spills faster than water."

People keep the same formal names, generation after generation, so that
the dwarves can remember them.

Need to drop hints in "Blizzard" about the magic mirror before it gets
used --- it should show things that aren't there, or something.

The prince is studying lists of mythical beasts (i.e. ones which are
naturally magical) --- a "coatl" is a two-headed serpent found in
tropical deserts.

Eyebrows like puffs of smoke.

Last Laugh says that people believe there are wolves left in hiding
because they want to believe it --- they feel guilty.

Show soldiers collecting taxes at the edges of Apple Bridge --- tax
collectors are referred to as "the King's Appetite", or as "the
King's Need".

"How much for a drink?" "A penny, but refills are free." "Well, in
that case, I'll just have a refill..."

Painted lynx (patchwork fur like a tabby cat), whippingdills (type of
bird), a tangling shrub called blind man's vengeance, and mumblefish.

Holding the cereal bowl with one arm wrapped around it as if to guard it
from hungry siblings.

Wizard traded for the power to only speak the truth, and became mute as
a result.

Trading mercy and pity to reinforce single-minded zealotry.

For Blizzard: the Balance says that in some cultures, important people

you can judge the state of a love affair by the ratio of the times the
two people involved spend thinking about each other

if one person is spending an hour a day talking to himself, and the
  other is spending five minutes dreading his calls, and not thinking
  about him otherwise (or thinking about someone else), it's over

sending gifts to someone when a love affair is starting makes them think
of you; sending gifts as it's ending is just exasperating

a way to keep yourself uppermost in their mind
adults know that love and gratitude are not the same; trying to make
  someone love you by making them grateful for gifts is a bad idea

calling condoms raincoats

first time I saw a condom, I didn't know what it was, I thought it was
a balloon

the other kids had pointed it out on the pavement behind the

years later, I worried about what I might have done; I might have
  picked it up or tried to inflate it like a balloon, and that would
  have been the end of me in that town

there are two kinds ghost: devil ghosts, who come back to haunt us, and
angel ghosts, who come back to see that we're OK, because they miss us
as much as we miss them

and the thing is, *we* get to decide what kind of ghost each is

after the first time she made love, she said "So that's why people
make such a big deal about rape. I always thought I would just be able
to lie there and pretend nothing was going on."

the first time we made love --- OK, we didn't actualy make love, just
got our shirts off and I got her jeans undone and my hand in but no
further --- two things struck me: the bicycle tan that flowed from
dark brown to pale white across her arms, like the coloration of a fish,
and her breasts, which were little pointy cones with slightly asymmetric
nipples, not globular like in the magazine pictures but little and
pointing out.

I've since learned that small breasts are much more sensitive. They
  almost always have bigger nipples, and there must be more nerve
  endings concentrated in them. But at the time, having learned all of
  what I knew about sex from the letters column in "Penthouse", I
  thought her excitement was normal. I've never met a big-breasted
  woman who really got turned on by having her nipples played with.

I occasionally overlapped with John --- he was a late nighter,

Dutch is a language in which to curse bad football; French is a language
in which to be scornful

after you break up --- sorry, this is supposed to be the truth ---
after you've been dumped for someone else, you should move, because
otherwise you'll spend your evenings telling yourself that she's not
going to call, and that it's stupid to make deals with yourself like
"If she doesn't call by Sunday, then it's over" because if that's
how you're thinking, it's already over

from you would probably put me in my grave", "But what about just a

He shed his worries by transferring them to a lamppost. What had been a
minor worry for him, however, was a major one for the lamppost, because
it had never worried before. It suddenly started wondering if its light
would go out just as one car overtook another, or if it might fall onto
a pedestrian during a storm. It tried to talk about its fears with other
lampposts, but they didn't understand, because they had never worried.

He saw his father reading and talking at the same time, and wondered how
it was possible. His father laughed and said, "As you get better at
reading, you'll be able to do it, too." But he never did. As other
children started to be able to sense each other's feelings, and feel
the long, slow breathing of the trees, he remained as inert as a piece
of iron. One day his family could deny it no longer: he was such a bad
reader, there was no life for him but that of a soldier.

really through it, like it was the soil itself. The closest a person can
come is floating in a warm pool, flowing with the gentle currents, no
longer contained in a balloon of skin.

Was just out cycling for an hour and a half; longest I've been on a
bike since Oregon, more than a year ago. It's hot out there, and I'm
sitting here in the office sweating. Amsterdam is full of cycling paths;
I went down to the Amsterdamse Bos park, then halfway up into the center
of town, then around by the Amstel River and back to the University. The
whole time, I was noticing the breasts of the women cycling by. I guess
it's something to do with posture, but it seemed that every third or
fourth woman had perfectly-shaped breasts under a bright cling-film
T-shirt. Little ones, medium-sized ones (I don't find big breasts
attractive --- they have the consistency of water balloons, and don't
look good unless they're trussed up in ornate underwear and their owner
is standing still), most in bras, some not, happy-looking women,
serious-looking women, women with wraparound sunglasses on that made it
impossible to tell what mood they were in... I don't want to spend my
summers alone any more. I don't want to wake up on my own for the rest
of my life.

Lord Kelvin (Popular Lectures I 73): "When you can measure what you are

in your thoughts advanced to the stage of a science"

### From Boswell's Life of Johnson

[Mr. Hunter] was very severe, and wrong-headedly severe. He used to
beat us unmercifully; and he did not distinguish between ignorance and
negligence; for he would beat a boy equally for not knowing a thing, and
for neglecting to know it. He would ask a boy a question; and if he did
not answer it, he would beat him, without considering whether he had an
opportunity of knowing how to answer it. For instance, he would call up
a boy and ask him Latin for a candlestick, which the boy could not be
expect to be asked. Now, Sir, if a boy could answer every question,
there would be no need of a master to teach him.

When a man writes from his own mind, he writes very rapidly. The
greatest part of a writer's time is spent in reading, in order to
write: a man will turn over half a library to make one book.

I have read in them where the pages are open, and I do not suppose that
what is in the pages which are closed is worse than what is in the open
pages.

Edwards: You are a philosopher, Dr. Johnson. I have tried too in my time
to be a philosopher; but, I don't know how, cheerfulness was always
breaking in.

Depend upon it, that if a man talks of his misfortunes, there is
something in them that is not disagreeable to him; for where there is
nothing but pure misery, there never is any recourse to the mention of
it.

There is no reason why any person should exert himself for a man who has
written a good book: he has not written it for any individual. I may as
well make a present to the postman who brings me a letter.

Calculating that a thousand guests per year is only three per day: That,
Sir, is the good of counting. It brings every thing to a certainty,
which before floated in the mind indefinitely.

Samuel Madden: "In an orchard there should be enough to eat, enough to
lay up, enough to be stolen, and enough to rot upon the ground."

Milton was a genius that could cut a Colossus from a rock; but could not
carve heads upon cherrystones.

An odd thought strikes me: we shall receive no letters in the grave.

### From The Rise and Fall of the House of Medici

...he had to be carried about the house and would cry out as though in
agony as he approached a doorway. "Why do you scream so?" his wife
once asked him, "Nothing has happened." "If anything had happened,"
he replied, "it wouldn't be any use crying out."

"These citizens would bring us water in their ears."

"Your Holiness, this is not my dining-hall," replied Chigi giving a
signal to his servants to pull down the tapestries which concealed rows
of mangers. "It is merely my stable."

Story idea: the last few scientists at an observatory in the mountains
as civilization winds down due to climate change. They have finally made
contact with an alien species, but there's no one left to tell who'd
care. We came so close to greatness...

Story idea: Scott of the Antarctic; the rock samples were Elder
artefacts, the changes ascribed to scurvy were actually caused by
exposure to alien relics, "I'm going outside and I may be some time."
Re-read The Coldest March before writing this one.

Story idea: putting people into stasis over and over again so that they
can take part in interstellar speed-of-light communication. After a

Batman/Cthulhu crossover: Batman's strength comes from tapping into
elder evils; he thinks he can control it; the Joker is a superhero from
an earlier generation who also tried, but failed, or possibly the Batman
thrown back in time.

Story idea: the young Prince Nuthe decides that renting laws is
unethical, so he makes all of the laws his family owns free. He then
discovers that money still runs the world, since expensive lawyers are
the only ones who know the laws and how to apply them. Story ends with
him deciding that the solution is to get rid of laws entirely.

Story idea: Maddie knew it was going to be a bad day when she saw the
robot and the troll arguing in front of the post office. (The world is
like that of Jack of Shadows; each is looking for a messiah from the
other side, and they eventually decide it's Maddie, but she tells them
off for it---no "chosen one" is going to fix things, they have to.)

Time travel story: your future self gives you everything you'll ever be
able to understand---what do you do with it?

Story idea: "An Orange for My Mother" is about a near-future Toronto
in the throes of collapse. Imported fruit has become rare enough that a
single orange is a birthday present.

Idea: Einstein and other 1920s-era physicists discover that the physical
constants of the universe change over time, and that the Great Old Ones
did once exist. Lovecraft overhears them...

Idea: an extension of the Pauli Exclusion Principle means that any
future you write about can't actually happen, which is why SF has
become so dystopian.

## Cherne

Smiths and magicians are natural enemies, which is why the Hett are viewed with such suspicion.

Can't use clouds for carrying freight: they have a hard time holding up things they can't drome.
Hold up sleeping passengers requires a skilled pilot.

Use this when soldiers get caught on a ridge, need to be rescued, jumping onto a cloud is a risky thing to do.

Cherne doesn't have ores, it has metals: there are bronze and brass

known in ancient and medieval times include terne (lead with 20% tin and
some antimony) and pewter.

Chittermites are small parasites that live in nostrils (the crude call
them "snotgurgles"). It's not fatal, but it *is* disgusting.

Once a year, people in Ensworth dress up like chickens and dance
solemnly around giant nests in their fields. It is dangerous to mock
them for doing this.

There's a hole in the bottom of the sea.

The "cammoth" is a mammoth camel found in the north.

The collapse of Plangentia destroyed the old kingdoms, and brought about
a dark age lasting two centuries or more --- climate change, monsters
released from underground caverns, etc.

The three great forests (Herd of Trees, southwestern, Bantang) are each
made up of a single interlocked tree.

The Thindi are trying to emulate the Uncertain Angels based on scraps of
surviving description --- it has gone from ritual magic to philosophy
to religion and back again several times in the world's history. One
important aspect is that the Uncertain Angels never spoke, but "let
their wishes be known". Under strict interpretation, this means that
aristocrats aren't supposed to talk, which puts a lot of power in the
hands of chamberlains.

Hive crabs cultivate coral to make their nests; the coral gets scraps of
food from the crabs' meals.

France is about a thousand kilometers across. Most kingdoms in
pre-modern times were much smaller than those currently mapped out in
Cherne. Therefore need to introduce some more:
-   More Regimental Kingdoms (twenty-one sounds like a good number,
    although only 15 survive into modern times). Put some islands in the
    Plangent Sea, and call the "kingdom" Plangent-That-Was. Also get
    rid of the name "kingdom", and call it a "command".
-   A buffer state between the Darpani and the Regimental Kingdoms. This
    is the latest in a series: in the north, the sharp drop in the land,
    and the forests, prevent the Darpani from making inroads, but in the
    south, there's a mixed kingdom of descended-from-Darpani nobility
    and Regimental commoners.
-   Some semi-independent kingdoms nested in the Brumosos, west of
    Praczedt. The northernmost is periodically refreshed by escapees
    from Uws; the others survive by providing goods to the Darpani, and
    because the terrain is too mountainous for horses. One of these is
    named after the "three grandmothers" who ran it with iron hands
    for almost a century. Another was founded by Thindi who fled north
    after YS 877.
-   The independent tribes in the Brumosos in Barra Bantang, which are
    too far from the sea for the Twin Admiralcies to bother with.
-   Add a river running southeast from the Brumosos along the border of
    the Karaband (and move the Sea of Glass further west). That can be
    the heart of a trading "kingdom" that is nominally part of Thind,
    but which has been independent for two hundred years. It has now
    broken into several sections, each centered around a major walled
    city. These are loosely federated with the true oases, such as
    Coriandel; the Darpani can't be bothered to conquer them, and the
    Twin Admiralcies see no benefit in provoking the Thindi by ending
    their "useful ambiguity". The people are not truly Thindi; they
    have more in common with their Karabandi counterparts, and there is
    a cultural "revival" under way which recalls the glory days of the
    Ultwaellian Empire that ruled the river valley before the desert
    encroached.
-   Awboon was founded by a Bantangui fleet that went west past Tultin
    Dal rather than fly the flag of the Southern Admiralcy. The
    Regimentals refer to it as the "Pirate Command", and piracy is
    indeed a major part of the local economy.

A "lenwife" is someone who specializes in seeing the souls of the
departed out of the world. Lenwives are found primarily in the
Regimental Kingdoms, Uws, Ruuda, and Praczedt; they are typically young
women (just as midwives are typically matrons). In ideal circumstances,
they show up before the death to help people adjust to the idea of
dying, which reduces the chances of them becoming ghosts, but some
always travel with armies as well.

Thind's rulers call themselves "regents", and (still) claim that they
are governing only until the Angels return. Thind is anti-innovation: if
it wasn't used in Angelic times, they are mostly opposed to it,
although they compromise fairly often when it comes to practical
matters.

Sick Street: a street near the hospital district where people with
interesting diseases hang around waiting to be called in to be used as
examples in lectures. Some of them whisper hints to the students for a
small fee.

It is considered poor form to be Minister of Song (in charge of public
entertainments) for more than six months, because the takings are so
lucrative.

Ruudian story about a Pale Remainder who falls in love with a woman who
loves a mortal man; the Pale cuts off the man's lips and member and
attaches them to himself.

The Spiral Library of Thind's lost capital: built so that books could
be added as they were written, the oldest in the center.

The body is the water, the person is the wave (the pattern); to say that
someone is dead, the Bantangui says, "The waves are still."

Belly oysters (whale symbiotes, much valued for the amber they produce).

"More yellow than gold" is an insult in Ruuda about the depth of
someone's faith.

Raising hats to the sun in prayer.

Cleanliness inherited from the age of Angels.

The lost Thindi colony in southwestern Cherne on the far side of the
land without sleep.

"Worship" of the Angels (prayers for their return) is suppressed
almost everywhere in Cherne; the only place where it's practiced in
modern times is in Thind, and among the Hett.

Sailors in Derway and Bruyere marry their ships.

The extreme southeast is the Sleepless Land (the further in you go, the
less sleep you get; madness from sleep deprivation for those who venture
in too far).

## The Prince and the Cloudherd

Rename characters so highlanders are Indecisia, Procrastinatia, etc.
(Make the book more fun to read...)

Replace father's visit with something dramatic that brings the magician
into the story and explains how magic works.

The theme is "choosing sides"; have to see people doing this for good
and bad reasons right from the start.

Introduce dayglass early on, so that it doesn't come as a surprise when
they are in the tunnel.

Fernando takes the other cloudherds up into the mountains on Pillow and
Old Blue, then brings the clouds back down "just in case". (Explains
why the cloudherds don't just ride up, and gives another taste of
cloudherding life.) Use this as an opportunity to introduce the
lightnings.

Need an adventure scene to get the blood racing: maybe Fernando sees
soldiers on the road (forced out of his way by lightnings on the way
back from the mountains), and they turn out to be the duke's. Some of
the soldiers are on patrol, and they have to be brought back? Or he
flies through a storm to bring the news, and then there's an argument
because people from another village have been harboring a few of the
duke's soldiers, and have a very different idea of what the war is
about. This only works if the prince and/or Sergeant Crimes have already
talked about the reasons for the war.

Describe what the prince is doing while Tahura is having her bad summer.

What's the point of introducing Tahura's father? Why do I need him?
Where is he used? Should that be taken out, and replaced with passing
references to his absence?

What's the point of the reference to Fernando's wife's mother?

## The Bookster's Apprentice

### Magic

Make it clear why the Hett want the Angels back: it is better to be
kicked by a cow that gives milk than by one that doesn't..

Middle book: just as adults face moral issues that children can't
understand, so too do the Angels grapple with things that human beings
won't ever fathom.

The idea that every spell has a price (sometimes a very odd one) isn't
established in this book as early, or as well, as it is in "Beneath
Coriandel". Need to see more quirky behavior in Thomas, with commentary
from Razi about how you can guess the spells that Thomas has cast from
the things he does. It's a whole academic discipline in its own right;
magicians often fake spell prices in order to throw off potential
opponents.

Thomas has to knock on the door of every room he enters. Razi points out
that this is a better bargain than some other magician made, which
required her to let everyone else go through the door first. Her ghost
still haunts the castle, waiting for everyone in the world to pass
through its front gate so that she can leave.

### The Uncertain Angels

The big blurt early on about the world's history doesn't work: it
slows the story down, and is too obviously info-dumping. That
information has to go someplace, though. More importantly, by the time
Thomas reveals that the Hett are trying to revive the last Angel,
readers have to understand why this would be bad.

- Have Thomas or Razi say that human beings were to them what dogs are
  to us; if even one Angel is alive, the world is not really
  humanity's.
- The Hett know this, and are actually looking forward to it: the
  world ruled by their fellow human beings hasn't treated them
  particularly well.

### The Spying Scene

There needs to be one pulse-racing scene early on. (Some readers
disagree, saying that conversation is action enough, but my 15-year-old
audience will probably want something more immediate.) I can smother two
gerbils with one pillow by:

- Eliminating the non-Piaerre-POV scene in which we discover that
  Gaeston and others have beaten Jaromir (while retaining the exchange
  where Elaine says, "That poor man," and Laeuc thinks she's
  referring to Gaeston rather than the Hett).
- Jaromir stumbles over Piaerre in the forest; says he's being
  chased, asks for help; Piaerre points him at a tunnel mouth; Jaromir
  says, "Of course!" (foreshadowing that he knows about the
  tunnels); then Jack, Gaeston, and others arrive on the scene,
  looking for him. They tell Piaerre that Jaromir was spotted spying
  in the village; Piaerre tells them where Jaromir has gone (Gaeston
  asks sharply how Piaerre knows; when Piaerre evades, Gaeston muses
  suggestively that Jaromir must have threatened him); Jaromir is
  caught and beaten.
- The bosun arrives on the scene, and the rest plays out as before
  (but with Piaerre as a witness). They meet Elaiene on their way back
  into Starboard Town. When she chastises her husband, it isn't
  because of any real sympathy with Jaromir: she's just embarrassed
  that *her* husband would get caught up in a brawl.

### Jaromir

Jaromir personifies the doctrinaire Hett. We need to see a *lot* more of
his character in order for this to work. He is as tough as Razi (much
tougher than any of the Avauntois), and has a sense of humor, but his
mission shapes everything. Early, he says things to Piaerre that hint at
stoical zeal; later, when he's interrogating Uyves, he points out that
he never lied, never stole, never hit back when he could have. It
wasn't just because he didn't want to give the game away: it was
because killing is wrong. Then why are the Hett killing? Because
sometimes other things are more wrong. "I'm willing to give my life
for this cause. If it is worth mine, then it is worth others."

### Miscellaneous

- Snails baked into egg bread.
- Exorcists build their shops on bridges (because ghosts don't like
  running water). In the Angels' Fall, where ghosts are more common,
  entire towns are built on bridges.
- When the land floods, fish swim among the fruited branches of the
  trees.
- Dogs are extinct in modern times (after a magical plague two
  centuries ago). This is why people say things like, "You look like
  you've seen a dog!" Not relevant to this story, so take it out:
  replace with things like, "You look like you were just kissed by a
  ghost!"
- At the same time, add more (dumb) beasts: pre-modern towns and
  villages were full of domestic animals.
- Name change: Apcha Bantang becomes Mau Apcha (to be consistent with
  other placenames in Ini Bantang and Barra Bantang).
- Mention the door soldiers (carvings that stand guard beside shop
  doors in Forecastle and elsewhere). The only one in Starboard Town
  is outside Mamaere Mayeule's tavern.
- Get rid of coffee: chocolate is the thing.
- Move the giant hands out of Vaarda and onto the plains, so that
  Piaerre can see them as Avaunt flies by. Use this as the starting
  point for discussion of the Uncertain Angels. (Have the horseman on
  the ground take his nap in the shadow of the hands, instead of
  underneath a tree.) The three paragraphs in the story start with,
  "When the Uncertain Angels ruled the world..."
- When they first see Tinhead, there's a pyramid in the center of
  each square. Klaues is the one who says, "They could be
  otthonkos." Word spreads, and some of the Hett in Forecastle are
  attacked. (Reveals that Klaues does know about his own people's
  legends.)
- "Miraculously, people did." Seems awfully convenient.
- What happens to the Bantangui fan book? Is it dropped in a crate, or
  re-folded and set aside?
- Cut the description of Bantangui calligraphy: not relevant, impedes
  flow.
- Cut (or cut down) description of Piaerre's crib: impedes flow.
- "Whether the captain's wife had detected anything strange in
  Starboard Town." Clumsy foreshadowing.
- Every one of the books mentioned the mountain, but only a few said
  anything more than, "It's big, it flies back and forth, and its
  people have no sense of humor." "Do people really think that about
  us?" Piaerre asked the fourth time he read it. "Oh, la," Razi
  said diplomatically, "They don't know you as well as I do."
- The main square in the Forecastle is called Mapmarket Square. The
  tiles are laid out as a map of Avaunt's progress over Cherne; the
  mountain's path is picked out in coins. Every evening, the chief
  bosun moves a peg showing the mountain's progress.
- Have Vurt grumble that the skull of the first bonescuttle he killed
  was bigger.
- Has Piaerre ever seen a forest fire burning from on high?
- Titles and honorifics: the Avauntois use patrize and patrisse for
  men and women. Uw and daw (uncle and aunt) are affectionate
  honorifics (like "boss") borrowed from Bantangui.
- A banner of snow blown off Avaunt's peak.
- Cutting and drying moss for use in the stinky house.
- Laeuc: "Oh, the Karabandi don't sacrifice chickens. They just
  scold them severely."
- A painting showing a boxer throwing the same punch forever.
- Razi: "We back into the future (must do, because we can see the
  past as we go)."
- A lammergeier is a bearded vulture that eats bones.
- A "saint" is a great scholar, inventor, or engineer. Saint
  Bearnard's Bridge, Saint Ehrm's balm, etc.
- They should swear by the death of all dogs, and by all the clocks
  that ever ticked.
- Que√ßenne talking about Vurt and Mayeule: old people get cute as they
  shrivel up.
- Spitting seeds over the balcony, watching the cat run up to each one
  in turn to sniff it.
- Vurt: "He's as dumb as a tiger." Piaerre: "But tigers
  aren't---oh."
- Steps of the Hardeck worn smooth by a waterfall of feet.
- Piaerre feels guilty about outgrowing his parents (particularly his
  father) intellectually, but doesn't want to stop it happening.
- "Malefit" is the opposite of "benefit".
- Avaunt needs more geography: ought to be at least one stone bridge
  across a ravine, and places where pulleys have been anchored to the
  rock to help Starboard Towners move loads from the Hardeck.
- A pattern on silk called "peacock's tears".
- The problem with books is that they can't change their minds.
- The hurt you get in the back of your throat when you're trying to
  stop yourself from crying.
- Feeding dyed grain to chickens to make them lay colored eggs (a
  story Laeuc told Piaerre when his son was young; Piaerre still has
  the egg).
- "That's like asking which side of a coin is the 'real' one."
  (Razi talking about who's right and who's wrong.)
- Some houses in the Forecastle have a "door soldier" (a large doll)
  by the front door: Enswer tradition.
- Jack the Parrot threatening to cake on someone's head. (Use
  "cake" more frequently, and have Piaerre get in trouble for using
  it.)
- "He could already feel Fraederiq's hands around his throat..."
  Feels "unearned": need to foreshadow Fraederiq as a bully before
  this.
- "Two thoughts chased each other..." Get inside Piaerre's head a
  little more here: have him remember some of Fraederiq's past
  mocking and bullying, so that readers can understand his indecision.
- "He could only guess how many hours Vaszlav had spent
  badgering..." Important character development point, but feels
  rushed.
- "A narrow bed and a polished teak dresser..." Move this detail
  up, so that it's better integrated.
- "...wondering in its little mind" Shift the POV.
- "Vurt was on his verandah, cursing in a flat monotone..." Seems
  to shift the POV to Vurt (needs to be Piaerre). Subsequent
  conversation slows the pace down.
- "weeping compass" only works if we already know that "weeping"
  is a curse.
- "A moment later, Vurt heard..." Another POV shift.
- "Piaerre stared at the map. The Brumosos curved..." Get inside
  Piaerre's head here: does he think that Fraederiq will never see
  this again? Or is that too maudlin?
- Mention somewhere that the mountain affects the weather around it
  (but less than the Avauntois think).
- "It didn't seem right, practicing verbs...but he couldn't think
  of anything else to do." Again, too passive: makes Piaerre an
  anti-hero.
- "Today you will finish with those deeds, yes?" Use "ledgers",
  and make it clear that these are things Piaerre was assigned
  earlier.
- "La, but enough of books for one evening." Have Piaerre be
  frustrated by Razi closing the topic, to express the reader's
  frustration at being teased.
- "...only for gallops for Jack the parrot..." Sounds strange,
  since parrots don't gallop.
- Change "nameday" to "naming day" (and have people use saints in
  their swearing earlier).
- "By my eyes, a dozen rabbits..." Need a better segue into this,
  so that it's clear the omniscient/reflective bit is over.
- "People falling from a great height..." Too obvious.
- "I do," Piaerre blurted. Piaerre is betraying Razi in a small way
  by spilling the beans here. It needs to be more dramatic: is Piaerre
  doing it because solidarity with his fellow Avauntois takes
  precedence over his relationship with his teacher? The scene shift
  at the end (Thomas's arrival) gets Piaerre and the reader out of
  dealing with the consequences---maybe better to stick with them a
  little longer?
- Papere Vurt snorted. "Looks a lot safer than what I rode up on."
  He needs to make a comment that makes it clear he understands the
  game Thomas is playing, but is willing to go along for his
  grandson's sake (or because he doesn't quite trust Razi?).
- "Razi and Thomas were already on board." They're very flat here:
  need the scene to crackle with tension between them to make it clear
  that while they are very reluctant allies, they will put their
  differences aside and actually work together.
- "The tunnels!" Piaerre exclaimed, pointing at the image in the
  window. This is too early: he already figures out the tunnels in a
  later scene.
- "Was it---who dropped it off?" Piaerre needs to be a little more
  shocked by the (presumed) theft at this point. Later, he briefly
  entertains the notion of keeping it (since he didn't steal it
  himself), but even as he thinks it, he knows he's just playing with
  the idea.
- "First, lie my Razi on his back." Why can she see him now, when
  she couldn't see him when Piaerre spoke to her the first time?
- "...and grabbed the window ledge." He needs to be clumsy here:
  he's still adjusting to his numb hand. Need to comment on it a few
  more times later, and then have him do something when he gets back
  to Starboard Town without even realizing (at first) that he's
  compensating for the numbness.
- "But what about the rest of our things?" Piaerre's first question
  ought to be about Starboard Town and his family.
- "It took them half an hour..." Piaerre should be noticing how
  clumsy his hand is during this half hour.
- "A piece of cake?" Doesn't work if "cake" is an obscenity.
- "...he couldn't even hate himself properly for having frozen
  again." Scene is too sparse to have any real emotional impact. It
  should have more adrenalin; he should blame his numb hand (and
  immediately hate himself for the lie). This is also where we first
  find out that he thinks at some level that helping Razi ought to
  have squared what happened with Fraederiq.
- "The bookster spread his his hands. 'La, nothing that hasn't
  already, I think.'" Razi is nonchalant about the Hett invasion,
  but Piaerre wouldn't be. Would Iseulle?
- Vurt's ladder: needs to have been reassembled and used (by the
  fleeing families) before Piaerre et al return to Starboard Town.
- "Idjen cakhuisa." The bosun, Jaromir, and Piaerre are together,
  just as they were at the beginning of the story: should use this
  echo somehow.
- "I'll be a haunt before you'll be his anything." Make it clear
  here that what Elaiene's upset about is the impropriety:
  appearances instinctively take precedence in her mind over anything
  else.
- "How many bushels of squash did we grow each year?" Piaerre has to
  say that he lied (though he doesn't know how much good it will do,
  given how much they obviously already know). Can't afford for him
  to be seen as a collaborator.
- When Gaeston calls Piaerre a leech, Piaerre has to feel the
  injustice of it---remember, he lied to the Hett.
- Piaerre's conversation with Jaromir about the library (which
  Jaromir calls the birbetke): the story has suddenly stepped back
  from Piaerre's thoughts. Need to keep it close: need to know what
  Piaerre is feeling as Jaromir tries to be friendly.
- "They got Iseulle to bed eventually." Even in shock, she wouldn't
  be this passive.

## Eimin in Medef: To Do

Do a shorter version (35,000 words, same level as "Bottle of Light").
Opening is, "My name is Eimin. If you want to understand my story, you
need to know three things. The first is that I'm Aphsi. The second is
that I'm nif, and I'm not going to tell you the third just yet."

Long introduction about Listening isn't used later; foreshadows
Eimin's decision to become a "counselor", but that doesn't happen
for another two books. Start with him cutting his thumb?

Why does droming prevent them from killing animals, but not from being
thieves?

"teasing or having fun" should be "teasing or tormenting"

Why is it so important to Eimin to play white?

More description/explanation of the gargoyles---they prey on the
herds, and "normal" Aphsi can't do anything about them.

Why is it such a big deal to Suresh that magicians are making Aphsi nif?

Sun goggles, not sunglasses.

Check ages: it's four years later, if it's his fourteenth birthday.

Can't Hediyeh drome Suresh's intentions in the pool?

The palace is really a villa, left over from the Clockwork Kings. Music
plays in it all the time.

Eimin walked two days each way to see the fleet in the glass.

Razi's quicksilver sword can't be scratched.

Grappa Uzman is the goatherd.

Little Ashwara is a neighbor's baby who is learning how to walk.

You don't "give someone your name", you "share it" (Suresh's
mistake).

Razi's group is called the Other Hand.

Lady Kembe in Ossisswe is the Aphsi's friend.

Eimin tried being a carpenter for a while, and made a lopsided table.

Eimin goes out to the fleet to prove that he's brave, but discovers
no-one cares.

The fat nif boy is named Youssein.

A scene where he hikes out to look at the fish with Youssein.

The "woman in black" is a senior member of the Other Hand. She had a
pair of magic gloves: when she's wearing one, the other mimics its
movements.

Eimin decides to hike out to the fishing fleet on his own after (a)
no-one but his parents and Youssein remembers his birthday, and (b)
Suresh tells him that nif are made, not born. (Eimin spills to Suresh on
his birthday, which prompts the confidence.)

## From the Sierra Club Guide to the Sierra Nevadas

Vegetation often grows in the joints between rocks, so that there are
straightlines of grasses and bushes.

A *nunatak* is a small island of rock in a glacier.

Staircase (or paternoster) lakes form in glacial valleys: one small lake
feeds into the next, which is down a rock step, which in turn feeds into
the next, and so on.

The air is significantly cooler in the shade --- even a single cloud
going by can chill things.

Wind blows upslope during the day (as valley air is heated), then
downslope during the night (as peak air cools).

Mountain crests are often capped with clouds; white cumulus clouds with
flat bottoms and rounded tops often "pop" with their bottoms at the
same level.

"Rotten snow" is snow that is full of cavities carved by running water
(from partial melting).

Sudden thunderstorms are common in summer: sheet lightning and fork
lightning are both common as well.

In the winter, thin-barked trees can crack because of ice build-up, with
a sound like a gun.

Needle ice forms in the ground in wet soil exposed to very cold air.

Snow banners often form streamers from peaks (wind blowing snow off the
peak).

Many trees at higher elevations have "pistol butt" trunks from being
dragged downslope by snow when young.

Jackrabbits grow fur on the soles of their feet, both for insulation and
to act as snowshoes.

The branches on sequoias can be bigger than most trees.

## From How Buildings Learn

The world "building" contains the double reality. It means both "the
action of the verb BUILD" and "that which is built".

Quoting O'Neill's "A Hierarchical Concept of Ecosystems": Most
interaction is within the same pace level---hummingbirds and flowers
pay attention to each other, oblivious to redwoods, who are oblivious to
them. The insight is this: "The dynamics of the system will be
dominated by the slow components, with the rapid components simply
following along."

Later, "it is at the times of major changes in a system that the quick
processes can most influence the slow."

"Form follows failure."

Quoting Illich, "History gives us distance from the present, as if it
were the future of the past."

## The Marionite Heresy

The Marionite heresy is this: once, before time and the universe began,
there was God. Something went wrong; we don't know --- we *can't*
know --- what or why, but somehow God shattered into a myriad tiny
fragments. Each of us today embodies one of those fragments; we call
them souls. Our highest purpose in life is to fit those fragments one
against another, to put the jigsaw puzzle back together and re-create
God. You know how it feels when you meet someone, and it's like you've
known him/her all your life? That's one of your adjacent pieces
slipping into place.

The point of this all is, pieces in a jigsaw puzzle don't just fit
together in pairs. Each piece can fit many others, in different ways.
That's why the romantic notion "for each of us, there's one other"
is wrong. For each of us, there's lots of different others, but the
number is very small compared with the number of people in the world.

(And Jenny said, "But I change shape over time...")

Ducklings tumbling down an Arctic cliff: a few are injured, but that's
OK, because it distracts the foxes from the ones that aren't.

New story: a family "whaling" for bio-rich asteroids in the cold dark
of space. The colony ship arrived just a few years after an asteroid hit
the planet they were supposed to settle; the ship itself is now a
crowded bazaar, while clans sail the darkness in makeshift spaceships.
No biotech: that's what destroyed the home world. The only pets in
space are the turtles; your status in the city is shown by the pet you
keep.

"I think," Tehanu said in her soft, strange voice, "That when I die,

world all that I didn't do. All that I might have been and couldn't
be. All the choices I didn't make. All the things I lost and spent and
wasted. I can give them back to the world. To the lives that haven't
been lived yet. That will be my gift back to the world that gave me the
life I did live, the life I loved, the breath I breathed." (Ursula
LeGuin, "The Other Wind")

...The reason we like the problem of racism is that solving it just
requires us to give up our prejudices, whereas solving the problem of
economic inequality might require something more---it might require us
to give up our money. When student and faculty activists struggle for
cultural diversity, they are in large part battling over what skin color
the rich kids should have. As long as we think that our best
universities are fair if they are appropriately diverse, we don't have
to worry that most people can't go to them. (NYT, April 2004)

A kindergarten pupil told his teacher he'd found a cat, but it was
dead. "How do you know that the cat was dead?" she asked her pupil.
"Because I pissed in its ear and it didn't move," answered the child

know," explained the boy, "I leaned over and went 'Pssst!' and it
didn't move."

A small boy is sent to bed by his father. Five minutes

Five minutes later......"Daaaa-aaaad....." "WHAT!" "When you

One summer evening during a violent thunderstorm a mother was tucking
her son into bed. She was about to turn off the light when he asked with
a tremor in his voice, "Mommy, will you sleep with me tonight?" The
mother smiled and gave him a reassuring hug. "I can't dear," she
said. "I have to sleep in Daddy's room." A long silence was broken at
last by his shaky little voice: "The big sissy."

From Alberto Manguel's The Library at Night:
-   Quoting Blake: "There is a Moment in each Day that Satan cannot
    find // Nor can his Watch Fiends find it, but the industrious find
    // This Moment & it multiply, & when it once is found // It
    renovates every Moment of the Day if rightly placed."
-   In one other practical sense, words create light. The Mesopotamian
    who wished to continue his reading when night had fallen, the Roman
    who itnended to pursue his documents after dinner, the monk in his
    cell and the scholar in his study after evening prayers, the
    courtier retiring to his bedchamber and the lady to her boudoir, the
    child hiding beneath the blankets to read after curfew---all set
    up the light necessary to illuminate their task.
-   In her novel The Blue Flower, Penelope Fitzgerald says, "If a story

- stealing meat from the store,
  frying it up before your mom gets home and then telling her she doesn't have make dinner tonight
  because you're not hungry anyway.

- relying on people who don't give a damn about you.
- finding the letter your mom wrote to your dad, begging him for the child support.
- taking a broken lamp from a stranger's trash.
- making lunch for your kid when a cockroach skitters over the bread,
  and you looking over to see if your kid saw.
- people eyeing you when you walk around in the market.
- not taking the job because you can't find someone you trust to watch your kids.
- the police busting into the room right next to yours.
- not talking to that girl because she'll probably just laugh at your clothes.
- hoping someone will invite you for dinner on holidays.
- people thinking they know something about you by the way you talk.
- crying when you drop the porridge on the floor.
- knowing you work as hard as anyone, anywhere.
- people surprised to discover you're not actually stupid.
- people surprised to discover you're not actually lazy.
- never buying anything someone else hasn't bought first.
- having to live with choices you didn't know you made when you were fourteen.
- getting tired of people wanting you to be grateful.
- knowing you're being judged.
