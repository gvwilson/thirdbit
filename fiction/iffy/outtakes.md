One step, two, three,
and then something sharp stabbed Iffy's leg.
A jolt of electricity ran through her.
She toppled over,
her muscles locked in place as the lights came back on.

"Yes sir,"
the Marine stand over her said.
"Some sort of pocket EMP.
No sir,
we're still looking,
but we have the girl."
He paused.
"Yes sir, right away.
Yes sir,
we'll have her on the truck as soon as it's done.
Yes sir—thank you, sir."

Strong hands lifted Iffy onto a stretcher.
She felt herself begin to tremble as the electric shock wore off.
*Help me!* she thought as she was rolled down a corridor,
around a corner,
through a waiting room full of frightened people scrambling to get out of the way
and down another long corridor.
*Please, I've changed my mind, I'll do whatever you want, just help me!*

No answer came.

"One, two, three."
The Marines lifted her off the stretcher and onto a cushioned table.
A woman in a white gown flicked a light across her left eye and then her right
as someone else set something cool and heavy across her forehead.
Cuffs clicked close around her wrists and ankles.

"Here, this will help."
A sharp prick stung the inside of her right elbow.
*Please,* Iffy thought one last time
before the whole world went away.

## Chapter 9

Iñacio was much better than her at hive and santorini.
He was better at another game called chess as well,
which was somewhat surprising given how often he suggested moves for Iffy
or corrected the ones she made.
She did some yoga with him,
stretching and breathing to the drone of a duduk
or the ping-pang-pong of a hanpan.
They made the most interesting meals they could from the shelter's stores,
pretended to lose themselves in sims,
and spent long hours staying out of each other's way
in the way that sailors, prisoners, and long-married couples have done
for as long such things have been.

The spiderweb of microwires threaded through the ground around the shelter
brought them news from the outside world,
though they had no way to know how much of it they could trust.
There were Zillion ships in Rothera's harbor,
but were the protests against them few and peaceful
or were the Marines trying and failing to put down an insurrection?
Had Australian troops landed in Halley,
or were the Aussie sailors who happened to be there
just being more rambunctious than usual?
Were the governors at war with each other,
and if so,
which side was Paddington South on?

Fighting was different.

The first time Iñacio said he was going to teach her how to fight,
she thought he meant in a sim.
He grinned at that,
briefly boyish,
then handed her some bandages to wrap around her hands.
He pulled his punches so much that she barely felt them,
but the frustration of never being able to land any of her own
stung more each time he dodged one of her clumsy blows.

"I think you're gettin' the hang of it,"
he said after their first hour.

"Doesn't feel like it,"
she grumbled,
annoyed at the petulance in her voice.
"An' anyway,
I don't see how it's gonna be much use against Marines 'n' machines 'n' whatnot."

Iñacio tossed his hand wraps into the wicker bin they used for laundry.
"Not everyone wears an exo,"
he said.
"An' once you got th' hang o' this,
I'll teach you a couple o' things about bots."

Seven days after they climbed down into the shelter,
Iñacio declared it was safe to open the hatch.
"Just for a bit,"
he cautioned.
"We'll get some air an' then pack up an' head out tomorrow."

The air in question turned out to be colder than Iffy expected.
Summer was coming to an end—the sun was noticeably closer to the horizon,
and she was glad for the gloves built into her jacket.
Aunt Naggie would be—she stopped and took a deep breath.
Aunt Naggie would be cleaning what she could,
getting the *Guinevere* ready to overwinter in Halley's harbor.
The two Mrs. Sandhus would be laying in stocks of pickles and preserves
and storing rectangular bags of rice and noodles
in airtight plastic bins beneath the floorboards of their store.
She hoped Jeep was helping his father,
and Honesty…

"What needs packing?"
she asked Iñacio,
tossing the last of the pebbles she had gathered into the stream.

They left the next morning after a double breakfast and one last shower each.
Iffy had a pack of her own this time,
which she firmly told herself she *wasn't* proud of.

The herd was waiting for them when they climbed out of the shelter's concealed entrance.

## Chapter 10

There were Marines on board Governor Stern's hovercraft,
all apparently imprinted with the same taciturn personality.
Two of them flanked Iñacio
as he disappeared stone-faced into the belly of the hovercraft
while the governor breezily explained to Iffy
that he was a man of his word
and that the Ecologist would be fine.
"Anyway,
it's not as if what he tried to do would actually have worked,"
he said.
Brainwipes worked very differently in real life
than they did in sims.
Deep memories would survive the EMP pulse,
just as a person's original personality survived imprinting.
As for more recent knowledge,
well,
the Shepherds had undoubtedly changed their access codes already,
and their network of shelters and greenhouses weren't actually as secret as they thought.

Iffy expected to be locked in a cell next to Iñacio.
Instead,
a Marine ushered her up steeply-laddered steps to the hovercraft's cockpit.
"Have a seat," the governor said,
gesturing at the padded chair to the left of the one he had been sitting in.
"Oh, and please, do buckle up.
This old thing was built for speed, not comfort."

Iffy limped over to the chair
and lowered herself onto it with a wince.
The governor clucked his tongue.
"I'll have someone take a look at that for you later."
Seating himself and snapping harness straps together across his chest,
he laid his hands on the apps set into the arms of his chair.

The display in front of them came to life.
A dozen views of the surrounding tundra
nestled between status displays like those Iffy had grown up with on the *Guinevere*.
Temperatures and battery reserves,
the rotational speeds of idling engines,
weather reports,
and projections from a hundred independent simulations of the next few moments
waited for attention
like courtiers waiting on a king.

"Where're we goin'?" Iffy asked sullenly.
She had loosened the straps of her harness so that she could wriggle out if she needed to,
but the straps had re-tightened themselves
as soon as she snapped the buckle closed.

"That's an excellent question,"
Governor Stern replied absently
as he rearranged the display with a few flicks of his fingers.
"Where *are* we going?
My others have never had much of an answer.
Truth be told,
I suspect they've never really believed one was needed.
Now, don't mind the noise.
I'm sure you'll get used to it."

The engines beneath them rumbled.
The hovercraft rose like a ship being lifted by a wave,
rotating smoothly on its self-made cushion of air.
Orange status lights blinked and turned green
as the sentry bots climbed back aboard.
"All accounted for, sir,"
said the Marine seated beside Iffy.

"Right, then, tally ho."
The governor flicked his fingers again
and the hovercraft shot forward like a startled seagull.

Acceleration pushed Iffy back in her seat.
Fifty klicks an hour, a hundred… two hundred…
At two hundred and fifty the numbers on the display stopped climbing
and the pressure lifted from her chest.
She took a deep breath and watched the world race by
as the hovercraft bumped and shook toward the horizon.
The only people in the world going faster than her at that preciese moment
were either on trains
or desperate enough to take to the air
and hope the machines' satellites didn't spot them.

The novelty wore off quickly.

Someone did show up
to give Iffy a patch to dull the pain in her knee and shoulder
and speed their healing.
Her eyelids grew heavy
as the drugs and timed retroviral accelerators seeped through her skin.
Even a mug of something thick and sweet that the governor called "chocolate"
wasn't enough to keep them from closing.

At least,
that's what she hoped whoever was watching her would believe.
She had learned how to keep sleep at bay on night watches long ago.
Right now,
she had some thinking to do
and she didn't want to be disturbed.

*Wireframes swam in the darkness.
The hovercraft had been built as a blockade runner in Tashkent
before the start of the machine wars.
Its heart was a reactor originally designed for use in a submarine—she
took a moment to admire the sleek, single-minded recklessness of its design—and
the motors that created its cushion of air
would have pumped fuel at hypersonic speeds
in orbital booster rockets
if history had unfolded just a little bit differently.
The hull plating was angled to deflect the energy of ballistic attacks
and threaded with microfilaments not unlike those in Iñacio's skull
to handle electronic ones.
Ventilation tubes,
triple-redundant optical wiring,
and plumbing liberated from a luxury hotel
slithered between bulkheads.*

*She flipped the wireframe upside down and rightside up,
flew through it,
spun it around.
Any of a dozen rooms or holds could have been repurposed as a cell.
For one moment she thought about reaching out to the hovercraft's core,
but no,
it would be better protected than the railgun back on the pier had been
and anyway,
she still didn't know how she had done that.
She needed a plan if she was going to rescue Iñacio.*

She yawned widely.
The images slipped away as her concentration finally conceded
to the painkillers and reconstructives.
A moment later she began to snore softly.

She woke to the smell of curried noodles,
and for a disoriented few seconds she thought she was back on the *Guinevere*
and late for her watch.
But no,
she was still buckled into her chair in the cockpit of the hovercraft.
She took the plate that the expressionless man in a Marine-blue jumpsuit offered her
and fumbled with the chopsticks
while she waited for her mind to catch up with the rest of her.

The governor was gone,
but the gently undulating tundra on the screens around her looked the same as it had.
Their speed hadn't changed either,
she noticed,
or their heading.
She did a quick calculation in her head.
If they had stayed on their original course,
they must be nearing the coast.
If they followed it east through the Shackletons
it would take them another ten hours to reach Halley,
if in fact that was where they were going.
If they turned right it would take them half again as long to get to
the crater that marked where McMurdo had once been,
and if they headed straight for Paddington South—

She shook her head and scooped some noodles into her mouth,
blowing around them as she realized they were hot *and* spicy.
Going to Halley didn't make any sense,
but since it gave her the least time it was probably what was going to happen.

She chewed thoughtfully,
then looked up at the Marine.
"It's really good,
but can I please have some more onions on it?
An' some more o' that chocolate stuff from earlier?
If that's aright,"
she added hastily.

The Marine looked at her,
his expression still as empty as the tundra.
"Good morning,
Citizen Kwan,"
the governor said pleasantly from a speaker somewhere in the cockpit.
"I'm glad to see you have an appetite."

"It's really good," she said truthfully.
"I'm just used t' more onions."

"Mm.
And of course you'd like to see more of the *Henry Lion*,
I assume."

She shrugged.
"Not much else t' do,
'less you're aright with me talkin' to Iñacio for a bit."

"I'm afraid that's out of the question for now,"
the governor said briskly.
"All right.
Private Norbu will take you down to the galley
and then show you to your cabin.
May I please ask you to forebear any dramatics?"

"What?"
she asked,
fumbling to undo the buckles on her harness.

The governor's voice sighed faintly.
"Don't do anything foolish?"

"Ah.
Sure,
aright."
She wriggled out of the straps without spilling any of her noodles,
then stood up and tested her knee.
Whatever had been in the patch seemed to have set it right.
If she had to run,
she could.
The trick now was having somewhere to run *to*.

As she stepped past Private Norbu
she slipped the metal button cover she had pried off her chair
into her pocket.

The galley was twice the size of the *Guinevere*'s
but much noisier.
The schematic in her head showed her the pipes,
drive shafts,
and optical cables
crammed into the half meter between its floor
and the foamed steel armor on the hovercraft's belly.
She could see three different ways to make trouble if she could reach them,
but she had no way to do that.
Even if she did,
they all had backups that had backups of their own.
The hovercraft was tough by design:
someone could punch a dozen shots from a heavy-duty railgun right through it
without slowing it down.

Private Norbu stood near the galley door and watched her eat.
She ignored him the same way she had learned to ignore shopkeepers
who didn't think an orphan dredger had any place in their store.
She thought briefly about trying to steal her chopsticks,
but by the time she finished her chocolate she had decided it was too risky.
They felt like aluminum,
and she could do a lot with a couple of aluminum rods,
but Private Norbu was right there
and there were probably cameras she couldn't see as well.
No,
the chopsticks were almost certainly a dead end.
The loose screw on the underside of the table,
on the other hand…

Her cabin had a fold-up bunk
and a single shallow drawer set into the bulkhead.
She picked up the app that lay on the neatly-dressed bunk
as Private Norbu closed and locked the door behind her.
It was the same model she had used as a child,
but completely locked down:
she couldn't even get the weather on it,
much less use it connect to Hell.

She kicked off her boots and lay down.
"Lights," she said after a moment.
The room dutifully went dark.

She closed her eyes.
There was no way she had the plans for every piece of hardware on the planet
stuck in her head.
Even if she did,
that wouldn't explain how she was able to talk to the machines
or how they were able to plant ideas in her mind.
She took slow, steady breaths to slow her pulse,
then tried to visualize herself.

Nothing happened at first,
or rather,
hundreds of things that weren't her formed, flew apart, and re-formed behind her eyes.
She saw something that looked like a mechanical musk ox
designed to hide in the herd,
and marvelled for a moment at
the ingenious way it emulated its organic namesake's digestive processes.
This was the *Guinevere* as she had been the day she first sailed.
That was French Henry in pieces on a workbench in Halley,
and for a moment she saw how the bot had once fitted into
an attack craft not unlike the hovercraft she was in.

And that—right there—was her.
She forgot to breathe for a moment as the image rotated slowly,
panning and zooming as her attention shifted.
In her spine,
along her nerves,
laced through her brain:
they weren't wires—those would be too easy for a scanner to spot—but rather
tiny fractalized patches of cells arranged in precisely the right way
to make her a living antenna.

And any antenna that could receive a signal could send one.

It only took her a minute to find an opening in the hovercraft's systems.
It took her another to find one that wasn't a trap,
and another hour to convince herself that she was right.
Fifteen years ago,
just a few days after she had been born,
a tech in Paddington South had replaced a reactor coolant pump
with one salvaged from an Aussie submarine
that had suffered a catastrophic loss of containment.
(Her hand twitched as if swiping an app
to toss aside the insurance reports and obituaries
that thought called up.)
The tech had cut corners to meet a deadline
(another twitch dispelled performance reviews and der eventual dismissal).
One of those corners had been a software shim
to connect the monitor's century-old software
to the hovercraft's merely elderly systems.

She studied the code tangled around the hardware
like nerves and veins around bones.
The pump's core was dumber than a seagull:
if she nudged it there and there and *there*,
it would believe that the hovercraft's reactor was going critical
and bypass its own safeties
to try to prevent disaster.
When the other pumps asked it what the hell it thought it was doing,
the long-ago tech's shoddy work would let her persuade them
that they had been ordered to shut down for maintenance.

She smiled,
not caring who might be watching through a hidden camera,
then rolled on her side and brought her hand to her mouth
as if to stifle a yawn.

The metal button cover she had stolen was stronger than she had expected.
For a moment she thought she might crack a tooth,
but then it bent enough for her to bite down and flatten it.
She spat the half-circle of metal with its two precious points
back into her hand,
rolled over again to cover the motion of slipping it back into her pocket,
and *pushed* with her mind.

Eleven point two meters away,
a pump whirred into overdrive.
Exactly three seconds later
its partners queried it,
compared the answers they received,
and powered down.
Iffy squelched the notifications they sent to the hovercraft's core
moments before they would have set off an alarm.
*Sleep well,* she thought giddily.
She had never ridden a high-speed multi-ton atomic bomb before.
She wondered how many people had,
and how many of them had lived to tell the tale.

She didn't realize her nose was bleeding
until an alarm klaxon began to blare
and she tried to stand up.
She had expected the alarm—in fact,
she was counting on it—but
she hadn't counted on being so lightheaded that
the room went distant and swam around her.
She bent over,
her elbows on the bunk and her face pressed against her forearms.

"Shad," she swore weakly.
There was a lot of blood,
even more than the time Akumé had punched her in the face
for calling der a thief
(which de had been,
but the other kids on the pier had been too smart or too afraid of der to say it).
Wiping her face with a handful of bedsheet didn't stop the steady red drip.

Iffy laughed weakly.
She had been so worried that someone would notice her stealing the button cover,
and now it turned out she needn't have bothered.
She wouldn't have to scratch herself to get a few red cells
to fool the hovercraft's genetic sensors:
she had as many as she could possibly want.

She straightened up and worked her tongue in her mouth.
It still felt like someone had replaced it with a piece of pressed jellyfish,
but the room no longer felt like an endlessly-receding tunnel from a horror sim.
She focused on the app lying on the bunk and pushed with her mind once again.
Something inside the door clicked and it slid aside.

Two minutes later she stood in front of another cabin door
and pressed her sticky hand against the contact place beside it.

"Affin' heck, girl, what happened t' you?" Iñacio asked as he stood.

"You should see the other guy," she said
grinning woozily.
"Any idea where our gear is?"

He shook his head.
"Prolly in a recycler by now anyway.
So whatta we do now?"

She jerked her chin toward the stern.
"Back an' out an' then figure th' rest out from there."

Someone was banging against one of the doors they passed.
They were shouting, too.
Iffy thought it was funny but didn't have enough energy to laugh.
At some point Iñacio had put his arm around her to help her stay upright.
He had picked up a fire extinguisher as well,
a compact red cylinder with a silver handle
whose basic design hadn't changed in centuries.
She blinked away the specs that flashed into her mind.
*Not now,* she thought.
Her nose was still dripping.
Anyone who wanted to find them could just follow the trail of drops and streaks on the floor.

"Here," she mumbled.
"…straps…"

"'Saright, 'saright, I got it,"
Iñacio said soothingly.
He turned her around and lowered her onto the molded plastic seat,
then buckled the harness across her chest
and pulled a bulky pair of goggles down over her eyes and nose.
"Bite on this,"
he told her,
pushing a mouthpiece against her lips.

Cold air filled her lungs as she breathed in.
"Ready?
No,
don' worry,
I'll be right behind you."
He took her wrists and placed her hands on the grips built into the seat.
"One… two… *three*."

She screamed into the mouthpiece as hovercraft fired the ejection seat into the air
like an old-fashioned artillery shell.
Daylight blinded her.
Ice-cold wind instantly numbed her cheeks.
Tiny gyros whined to stabilize the chair
long enough for the explosive bolts in its back to fire.
A translucent parawing snapped open.
The surge of deceleration threw her against her harness
and then she was swinging like a pendulum
as the parawing's tiny core picked a safe landing spot
and turned toward it.

The ground below her was covered with snow.
The harsh white reached from horizon to horizon,
interrupted only by a few dark boulders
and the camouflaged rectangular bulk of the hovercraft
that was already several hundred meters away.
It must have turned inland toward the pole,
but Iffy didn't have time to think about that.
She was flying,
really actually flying,
except it was going to be over in a few seconds
and if the chair hit the ground the wrong way
she might tumble and snap her neck.
The gyros were supposed to prevent that,
but she had seen their specs when she was planning her escape
and they had last been serviced by the same tech
who had screwed up the coolant pump.

A flash of light at the rear of the hovercraft
threw a black dot into the seamless blue sky.
A hundred meters above the ground it jerked suddenly
as its parawing deployed.
Iffy's fumbling fingers finally found the catch on the harness buckle.
It bleeped and flashed,
unhappy about being unfastened while in the air,
but she jammed her thumb down hard to force it open.

Snow raced away beneath her far too fast for safety.
She was headed straight for a boulder.
She was going to hit it.
She was going to hit it,
but the parawing cupped the air to brake,
throwing her hard against the straps as if to punish her for breaking its rules.

The chair landed on the snow with a crunch.
Iffy spat out the mouthpiece,
pulled off her goggles,
wriggled out of the straps,
tripped,
and fell face-first into the little snowbank thrown up by the chair's impact.
Ice crystals stung her face and hands.
It was cold,
she realized,
really cold.
They must have come a long way inland.

The chair bleeped.
Panels popped off its bulky arms
to reveal a featherweight windproof parka rolled up
to be not much larger than a lunch-sized roti on one side
and a waistpack with a tiny first aid kid,
a ruggedized app,
a pair of multitools,
and three high-energy snack bars on the other.
The specs had shown four,
and as she strapped the waistpack on
she wondered if that long-ago tech had gotten hungry while he was working.

It took her three tries to clamber up the boulder.
Her nosebleed had stopped,
leaving bits of red crust on her lip,
but she was still lightheaded.
She shielded her eyes with her hand.
There—Iñacio's chair had just landed a few hundred meters away.
The governor had undoubtedly retaken control of the hovercraft,
only to discover that all three coolant pumps had burned out
and would need to be replaced
before it could move again.
If his Marines had the same exoskeletons as the ones in Halley and Rothera,
she and Iñacio only had a few minutes before they arrived
to recapture their ex-prisoners.

"Hey!"
She waved both arms.
Iñacio waved back and started toward her.
Iffy slipped off the boulder,
made her way back to the chair,
and got to work.

The upper back plate on the ejection seat had six screws.
The lower plate only had four.
The schematic in her head didn't need them,
but she pocketed them anyway as she took them out.
"No such thing as scrap," she muttered under her breath.
It was one of Mister Mishra's favorite sayings,
but there wasn't time to think about him or Jeep
because she had to tighten the spigot valve on the seat's tiny fuel line all the way
before prying out the fist-sized tank of high-test peroxide
or she and her escape were both going to be very short-lived.

Iñacio's boots crunched on the snow a minute later.
"What're you—oh no.
No no no,
you can't be serious."

She grinned madly and pointed at the parawing
without looking up from the vernier motor she was crimping into place.
"Straighten that out if you can
an' then get the straps off th' chair.
We're gonna have t' double up."

Another minute, another minute—there.
Iñacio handed her the ends of the parawing's tether lines.
She clipped them onto the harness and handed it back to him.
"I can't carry you, so you gotta carry me," she said,
cutting off his protests.

The snow field dipped gently on the far side of the boulder.
It wasn't much,
but it would have to do.
"Ready?" she asked.

Iñacio shook his head.
"Nope."
He bent over like a sprinter and started to run.

Iffy waited for the lines to go nearly taut before shouting,
"Now!"
and yanking the edge of the parawing up as hard as she could.
The makeshift rocket strapped to Iñacio's back flared,
kicking him forward.
For an instant Iffy thought it wasn't going to work,
but the core she had pulled out of the chair wasn't smart enough to wonder
how or why its world had changed.
It just knew its wing was out of position.
Tiny motors whirred,
frantically adjusting the parawing's shape
so that it cut the air at just the right angle
to lift Iñacio into the air.

He whooped,
his feet still pedalling as they left the ground.
Iffy ran back and scrambled up the boulder and shielded her eyes,
her heart pounding.
Four black dots had come over the horizon.
She counted seconds under her breath.
The snow was slowing them down, but not much.

"Over here!" she shouted,
waving as Iñacio banked in a wide, clumsy turn.
One moment he was over *there*
and the next he was coming straight at her,
wide-eyed and shouting something she couldn't hear.
She took a deep breath and spread her arms wide.

Iñacio hit her with a thump that cracked her spine.
His hands scrabbled for purchase on her parka,
but the fabric was too slippery,
it was designed to shed water and he couldn't get a grip
but that was aright,
she had grabbed hold of the straps
and her feet were kicking at nothing but air.

She twisted around as far as she dared as he whooped again.
The rocket on his back flared again,
lifting them higher.
*It's me, it's just me,* she thought frantically,
hoping that whatever faraway machine she had made her bargain with was listening.

"So what now?"
Iñacio had to shout to be heard over the wind in their ears.

"I gave it a heading,"
Iffy shouted back.
"Figure we got about half an hour in the air.
We'll have to walk the rest o' the way."
The snow field below her looked exactly like a sim but was completely different.
She finally understood why so many people wrote poetry about flying,
and why they said that of all the machines had taken away from humanity,
this was the one whose loss hurt the most.

In the end the little rocket only lasted ten minutes,
but that was enough to get them high enough to catch the wind.
Antarctica rolled away behind them.
Iffy's shoulders began to ache,
then to burn.
The straps they were tangled in dug in to her triceps.
She'd have bruises,
but she'd had worse,
and the view—whatever else happened,
she swore she would find a way to fly again.

After one last lift from a thermal rising off a stretch of exposed rock
they began a long, slow descent.
"Get ready!" Iñacio shouted.
Iffy grabbed the strap with one numb hand and let go with the other
so that she was half beside and half behind him.
The parawing's little motors whined in protest as they reshaped it
to adjust for the shift in weight.
Ten seconds…
Five…
As her boots grazed the snow she tried to run,
but her toe caught on a crust of ice.
She let go of Iñacio and sprawled face-forward.

His landing was more graceful.

"Well," he said,
helping her to her feet
as the parawing carried the harness away.
"Can't wait to tell Nagatha about *that*."

She wiped ice and snow off her face and returned his grin.
"Sure was somethin'.
C'mon,
we still got some walkin' t' do."

Two snack bars and several mouthfuls of lukewarm water later,
they reached an outcropping of rock too regular to be natural.
Iñacio ran his hands over the pipe shafts drilled into its laser-cut top.
"Old weather station?" he hazarded.
"Looks like it was salvaged a long time gone."

"Mm hm."
Iffy pointed at the shadow on the horizon.
"You know what that is?"

Iñacio laughed.
"Girl,
I have no idea where I am right now.
You could tell me that was the Andes an' I'd believe you."

"That's Mount Tyree."
Iffy's voice was more serious than she'd intended.
"The secret base Wales an' th' machines an' everyone have been goin' on about?
It's halfway 'round to your right an' just shy o' the peak.
I figure that's where th' governor was takin' us."

Iñacio nodded slowly.
"Long way off."

"Yeah, well."
Iffy studied the dark rock in front of them.
"Dunno what kind o' sims you play,
but my favorites?
Nobody puts an underground base in 'em without puttin' a bunch of other stuff around it,
so I had a poke around the governor's backups while you were lazin' around on th' hovercraft."

There.
She pulled off her glove,
scraped some dried blood out of her nostril,
and stuck her finger in one of the drill holes.
The rock thought for a second and then opened with a faint click.

She grinned at Iñacio.
"Welcome to *my* secret lair."

*Suppose the world is ending
and you want to build a secret research facility—a place
completely cut off from what's left of the world's governments
or (more importantly) their artificial minions
so that you can create or study things you shouldn't
without being interrupted.
You might think that the first step was to choose a location,
but it's not.
The actual first step is to pick a cover story
that gives you a plausible reason to imprint prisoners and indentured laborers
with the skills you need
and then erase their memories afterward.
(In theory you will only erase their memories of where they were and what they did.
In practice the process is sometimes imprecise,
particularly if you want to err on the side of caution,
but if you're the sort of person who needs a secret research facility,
you're probably also the sort who believes that
nothing worth having comes without some kind of price.)*

*If your cover story is something to do with reforesting ravaged rainforests
you will probably build your base in Africa or Indonesia.
You might consider Brazil,
but even before the war with the machines
it has become a complicated place as nationalism,
macumba,
and apocalyptic ecology hybridize in ever-more-strident ways.
If your cover story is related to climate engineering,
on the other hand,
no one will raise an eyebrow if your site is somewhere formerly arctic.
The Melt hit the poles first and hardest,
and most of those mad enough to believe that the damage can be undone
by scattering megatons of absorbent catalysts over thousands of square kilometers
naturally congregate there.*

*The poles are exactly the wrong place to go
if you want people to believe that you plan to launch something into orbit,
but in a way that works in your favor.
Everyone expects you to lie about what you're actually doing,
so telling part of the truth is a good way to hide the part left unsaid.
A ground station for a network of microsatellites
flung into orbit by an automated factory located somewhere on the far side of the Moon?
You are so obviously courting condemnation for adding to the already catastrophic volume of space junk
that no one will suspect that's what your base is actually for.
Or rather,
everyone (and everything) will suspect it,
but only as one of a thousand low-probability possibitilies.*

*To finish throwing them off the scent,
you can build a dozen safe havens in a circle around your base.
To keep the workers safe,
your public relations bot explains to anyone who cares to pay attention.
Antarctica's storms have been growing in frequency and severity for decades,
and it will only be a matter of time before tornadoes appear.
You may not be able to guarantee that your laborers will return with their memories intact,
but you will of course do your utmost to ensure that they do return.
Deeply dug and well provisioned,
your bunkers will allow them to wait out the worst the southern continent can throw at them in comfort.*

Iñacio insisted on climbing down the ladder ahead of Iffy,
so he was the first one to realize that something bad had happened in the shelter
many years ago.
"You might not wanna come down here,"
he called up to her.

*Ain't like a got a lot o' choices,*
she thought but didn't say.
The Marines could reach them in a couple of hours if they pushed their exoskeletons to their limits,
but the governor was sure to have other tools at his disposal.
If they couldn't find something in the shelter they could be trapped,
and a siege would only end one way.

The smell hit her halfway down.
It wasn't rank like the week-dead seagull she had once found in a storage bin behind the Sandhus' store,
trapped by a lid closing behind it as it scrounged for scraps.
Instead,
the smell was tired and a little bit sour.

"Core woulda shut off power after he died,"
Iñacio said as they studied the mummified body
lying a stride away from the bottom of the ladder.
"Cold an' dry air—coulda happened last year,
coulda been a hundred years ago."

"More likely a hundred,"
Iffy replied,
feeling oddly detached.
Whoever he had been,
he'd had long dark hair and a beard.
The inside of his parka was silvered like hers,
and if he had brought any gear,
it had either been taken by whoever shot him
or was lying on the shelves that lined the shelter's walls.

She shook herself.
"C'mon.
Let's see what we got."

What they had turned out to be weapons,
dried food that had either spoiled or mummified like the corpse,
several camouflage snowsuits with boots and breathing masks
(she puzzled over this for a bit),
and a small workshop stocked with tools and spare parts that made her hands itch.
"Looks like they were buildin' bots,"
she told Iñacio,
turning a laser cutter over in her hands.

"Or takin' 'em apart."
He pulled a tarp off something that looked like
an oversized version of the sentry bots she was familiar with.
One of its side panels was folded back to reveal its motors and cables.
Another tarp revealed a second bot with the same bulky body and limbs
but a cluster of cameras and antennas where its head should have been.
The mod had clearly been made in haste:
the welds joining the additions to the bot's neck looked messy and unfinished,
and a handful of string-thin optical cables dangled from the opening.

Iffy looked around the shelter's single large room a second time.
Something didn't make sense.
"How were th' bots gonna get out?" she asked suddenly.
"No way they could make it up th' ladder."

Iñacio nodded,
putting the short-barrelled thump gun he had picked up
back on its shelf.
"I'll check th' walls.
You wanna see if you can get anythin' outta that?"
He pointed at the desktop near the two bots.

She nodded and sat on the stool in front of it.
The faint scum of dust on the app felt gritty under
the finger she swiped across it.
"Aright,"
she muttered.
"What have you got for me?"

Five minutes later she smacked the app in frustration.
"I can't find a way in," she sulked,
slumping down in the chair.

"Here."
Iñacio tossed her a thumb-sized key on a thin chain.
"It was around his neck,"
he explained as she stooped over to pick it up.

The key fit into a slot on the edge of the app.
Its screen went a deep blue.
A single icon appeared,
waiting patiently to be tapped.

Iffy bit her lip.
"Could be some kind o' malware.
Like, a trap or somethin' to fry anyone that looks at it."

Iñacio nodded.
"Could be."
Without warning he spun her around
and pushed hard on the back of her chair.

"Hey!" she squawked as she rolled away.
"What are you—"

"—a chance to hear this,
but if you do,
I'm sorry, love.
I'm so, so sorry."
The recorded voice was a man,
and sounded tired and frightened and brave all at once.
"I thought we could fix things,
but we've only made them worse."

Iñacio turned and beckoned her to join him as the recording continued.
"Suyin left this morning with the last of the shielding."
The voice chuckled or choked back a sob—it was impossible to tell which.
"She said she thought she might be able to make it to the machine
if she cycled the algorithm rapidly enough,
but I think she just wanted to be with Georgia,
wherever the hell she is now.
None of the other shelters are answering any more,
not even Johnson's team."

Iffy reached for Iñacio's hand.
He squeezed hers back.
"I've disabled two of the guard robots—at least I think I have—but
number three is still roaming around in the auxiliary tunnels.
I know we all agreed that—that the project needed a failsafe,
but…"
The voice paused for a heartbreaking moment.
"But I never thought we'd need it.
I never thought we'd—oh crap."

Iffy jumped at the sharp *crack!*
Iñacio squeezed her hand again at the sound of something heavy hitting the floor.
A moment later metal clicked on concrete
as something approached the app,
and then the recording ended with a soft, cheerful *ding*.

"Well."
Iñacio gently pulled his hand free and swiped the app.
"Doctor Arno Severin,"
he read aloud as Iffy lowered herself back into her chair.
"Doesn't say who it was for,
but I'm guessin' these two were Suyin an' Georgia."
He paused.
"Oh.
Well,
ain't this a surprise."
He looked at her over his shoulder.
"I think you're gonna wanna see this."

Iffy nodded but didn't stand.
She knew the Marines were getting closer every moment,
but all of a sudden she just felt tired.

"Iffy?
Y'aright?"

"Yeah."
She pulled herself to her feet.

Two dozen smiling, confident faces were arranged on the app
in eight rows of three.
The top row contained a man with long dark hair and a beard
and two women who looked like clones of each other.

"Recognize him?" Iñacio asked,
pointing.

Iffy nodded slowly.
"Yeah.
Yeah, I do."
Somehow she wasn't surprised to see Johnson Wales looking back at her.

## Chapter 11

There were no other recordings,
at least not that Iffy could find,
but there were maps and schematics.
The maps showed a network of maintenance tunnels
just big enough for centipede-shaped bots
that reminded Iffy of French Henry.
She would be able to fit her arm into one of them,
but no more,
and some of them ran (or had run) for tens of kilometers.

There were other tunnels too, though,
big enough for heavy equipment.
Some were dense with red flags that showed collapse,
flooding,
or chronic instability.
She puzzled over that for a second before dismissing it.
Reasons weren't important:
a blocked tunnel was no use to them.

Iffy had expected the web of tunnels to be centered on the Niobium base.
Instead,
the center was a kilometer further south
on the slope of Mount Tyree instead of at its peak.
Iñacio shrugged when she pointed this out.
"Wouldn't be surprised if th' real whatever is somewhere else again."
He jerked his head toward Severin's remains,
which he had wrapped in the tarp he had pulled off the sentry bot.
"Folks like this never thought in straight lines.
Whatever you can see ain't real,
and whatever's real,
they'll have hidden under three different kinds o' camouflage."

But the mystery of what was actually buried under Mount Tyree
wasn't what made Iffy chew her lips
the way she had when she was first learning algebra.
That was the schematics' fault.
They made no sense.
She could think of a hundred uses for a superconducting ring
large enough to sail the *Guinevere* through,
but why put a bamboo rat cage at its center?
And if you had a yottahertz laser capable of vaporizing steel from orbit,
why would you point it directly at an identical laser,
and why would you leave just enough space between them for
one (1) adult with arctic-rated camping equipment
and a month's worth of high-energy rations?

She sat back,
stretched,
and yawned so widely that her jaw clicked.
The only explanation that made sense was that
the app's records had been deliberately scrambled and polluted
when things went skew.
It didn't matter now:
if the governor had sent Marines,
they would arrive in an hour,
maybe less.
She had done her best to wipe the shelter from the hovercraft's memory,
but they would have other records.
Even if they didn't,
they would have to be blind to miss the parawing and bootprints,
and they wouldn't have come all this way
without something that could cut through
the rock concealing the entrance.

"I don't like it,"
Iñacio said,
studying the route she had sketched on the map
that filled half the app.

Iffy shrugged.
"Every other way I can find has a big chunk o' walkin' in it.
This might too if there's been more cave-ins,
but there's no way o' knowin' 'til we get there.
'Sides,
more chance o' meetin' some actual monsters this way.
Be a waste t' be down here an' not run into any."

The Ecologist snorted.
"Folks ever tell you you're a bit sideways from normal?"

Iffy shrugged again.
"Most never get t' know me well enough to find out,"
she admitted.

Iñacio put his hand on her shoulder and gave her a gentle shake.
"I'm glad I have.
You get th' bots back online.
I'll see what I can do about wheels."
He studied the sketch she had thrown together
on the other half of the app,
shook his head,
and began rummaging through the shelves of equipment that lined the shelter's wall.

It took Iffy ten minutes to fix the damage done to the sentry bots
and another ten to convince herself they were safe to power on.
Their optical sensors didn't glow red—that only happened in sims—but
she did take an involuntary step back
when their heads turned in unison toward her.

"Sit," she ordered.
One lowered itself to the concrete.
The other studied her
while its core tried to decide whether her voice patterns
matched those in its memory closely enough.

"I said *sit*," she repeated as firmly as she could.
The bot took a step toward her,
hesitated,
and crouched beside its twin.

Iffy swallowed drily.
The problem wasn't that the bots' programming was too complex for her to figure out.
The problem was that it was too simple to fool easily.
She didn't know if that was because they were old enough
that their code didn't have anything from the machine wars mixed into it,
or whether they had been built that way deliberately for safety.
Mister Mishra was fond of saying that there was no way to fool a hammer.
Just this once she hoped he was wrong.

"You just about done?"
She jumped at Iñacio's voice.

"Hope so," she said briskly,
promising herself mentally that she would never watch another horror sim again.
"Let's hook 'em up."

Long before there were buses and hovercraft there were ox-carts and chariots.
Iffy didn't know if anyone had ever built one to be pulled by two sentry robots,
but if so,
she was pretty sure they hadn't made it out of
a heavy-duty dolly and fiber optic cables.
She nudged it skeptically with her boot.
The frictionless bearings in its wheels were undamaged,
so it would roll enough,
but even without the schematics in her head
she could see that it would want to slip, tip, or flip
at every bump and corner.

Iñacio took a moment to say a few quiet words over what was left of Arno Severin,
then lowered himself gingerly onto the dolly beside her.
A plastic crate full of tools sat beside her,
and another one with weapons and spare parts for the bots nestled under his elbow.
None of the weapons had responded to their touch,
but they would still add useful weight.

The Ecologist looked at her and grinned.
She grinned back.
"Yip yip!" she said,
snapping the cables she had rigged as reins.
("So that I'll have somethin' t' hold onto,"
she had told Iñacio,
who had nodded straight-faced in response.)

The bots didn't move.
Iffy sighed.
"Forward one quarter speed," she ordered.
The dolly jerked beneath her as the bots set off at a trot into the tunnel.
Iñacio thumbed a handlight and pointed it ahead of them.

"Increase speed to one half."
The dolly's wheels made a sizzling sound as they rolled faster into the unknown.

Iffy had expected the tunnel to be level,
but instead it rose and fell with a kilometer-long rhythm.
"For drainage?" Iñacio hazarded,
though the floor was desert dry.

After half an hour her back was aching and her backside had gone numb.
She was about to suggest that they stop to stretch
when the two sentry bots pulled up short.
"Whoa!" she squawked as the dolly smacked hard into their hind legs.

The bots ignored her.
Their heads twitched this way and that in an almost birdlike way.
The one that had hesitated before accepting her orders took a step and stopped.
Without warning a panel on its back flipped open
and something stubby and lethal looking popped up.

Iñacio swore under his breath and reached for the crate beside him.
The gun on the bot's back spun around to point at him.
"Aright, aright," the Ecologist said,
raising both hands.

He caught Iffy's eye and jerked his head backward.
She nodded,
then swivelled slowly to the side and put her boots on the concrete.
When Neither of the bots moved
she slid forward and slowly stood up.

Metal clicked on concrete somewhere in the darkness ahead of them.
The bot's gun spun around again.
"Easy, easy," Iñacio said soothingly as he got to his feet as well.
"I'll just get all this off you an'—nope, nope, ne'er mind."
He let go of the cables he had gathered up in one hand and stepped back.
The bot's gun tracked his motion for one extra warning second
before spinning around to point into the darkness once again.

"I think—" Iffy started,
biting off her words when Iñacio flashed the flat-palmed handsign that meant "quiet".
*I think it's the other bot,*
she finished in her head.
She closed her eyes and tried to slow her breathing.
Nothing:
no images flashed into her mind
and no thoughts suddenly emerged fully-formed.

Metal clicked on concrete again.
Her eyes snapped open.
The sound was *behind* them this time.

She and Iñacio turned in unison.
The light in the Ecologist's hand reflected off three—no, four—bots
like the pair that had been pulling the dolly.
One was missing part of a foreleg.
Another's side was deeply dented
as if something had tried to punch right through it,
and all four bore more scratches and scars than Iffy could count.

The lead bot took a step toward them.
"Hey now," Iñacio cautioned.
"We ain't lookin' for trouble."

"Ssh."
Iffy studied the bot.
"I don't think it wants t' hurt us.
Matter o' fact…"
She raised both her hands,
turned around slowly,
and reached into the crate of tools she had packed earlier.

"F'real?" Iñacio muttered disbelievingly.

"You got a better idea?" she shot back under her breath.
An adjustable wrench,
a screw jack that might be able to outdent the bot's side—what she really needed
was Mister Mishra's shop and Johnson Wales' toolbox,
but these would have to do.

She turned around to face the bots and held the tools out.
"Aright?" she asked.

None of the bots moved.
For one panicked moment Iffy thought she had guessed wrong,
but then the bot that had stepped forward took two more steps toward her
and lowered itself into a crouch.

"We don't have time for this,"
Iñacio said quietly a moment later.

"Tell them that,"
Iffy replied absently.
These bots had been built to be scouts and guards and weapons.
The blunt claws on the ends of their legs could pick up a rock
or grab hold of someone's arm,
but were no good for delicate work.
Scratches and dents on the bot's inner frame showed
where they had tried to repair each other anyway.

"Gimme the crate,"
she said over her shoulder.
"Please."
Iñacio lifted it off the dolly and set it down beside her without comment.

Wire,
a crimping tool that she could use to cut it,
a screwdriver with a torsion readout built into its handle—there.
She patted the bot's back.
"Good as new."
Which was a lie,
but felt like the right thing to say.

The bot stood,
braced its legs,
and shivered through a rapid self-test.
When the reflex capacitor that Iffy had just wired into place didn't rattle
it made a soft, incongruous *ping*
and stepped aside to make room for another member of its pack.

Iffy put her tools back in the crate and stood.
"I'm sorry,"
she said.
"We gotta keep movin',
but if you wanna come with us
I'll fix you when we get somewhere safe."

The bots didn't move.
"We really gotta go,"
Iff said,
turning to pick up her crate.

A clawed foreleg closed around her arm.
"Hey!"
She smacked it with her hand.
"None o' that, aright?"

The bot released her but didn't back up.
She glanced at the two still in harness and frowned.
"Pass me a cable,"
she said to Iñacio.
"I have an idea."

The bots didn't have collars,
but a lifetime at sea had taught Iffy dozens of ways to tie a knot.
She left plenty of slack so that the bots could pull their heads out if they needed to.

When she was done,
the three bots that had all of their legs waited patiently in a line behind the dolly,
the cable loops around their necks.
Iñacio shook his head.
"Nagatha's never gonna believe this."

Iffy grinned.
"Come on, you," she said to the fourth bot.
"Up you get."
She put her hand where its neck would have been and tugged it forward.
Limping,
it clambered up onto the dolly and crouched down
where Iffy and Iñacio had been sitting.

"Nope, nope, not there."
She tugged it again,
then sighed when it didn't move.
"Aright,
stay there if you want to—we'll get a better view up front anyway."

"Can we go now?"
Iñacio asked testily.

Iffy nodded.
"Yip yip!"
The bots in front of them didn't move.
"Worth a try," she muttered.

"Forward one quarter speed,"
Iñacio ordered.
A moment later they were rolling through the tunnel once again
with three of the new bots following single file behind them.

Iffy leaned back gingerly.
The crippled bot on the dolly rotated its head to study her.
After a moment she draped an arm over its back to steady herself.
It wasn't actually more comfortable than just sitting upright,
but it was somehow more comforting.

She didn't notice the extra clattering at first.
Or rather,
she wasn't the first to notice that
there was more sound behind them than there should be.

She snapped out of her daze when the three sentry bots
trotting in step in the dolly's wake pulled up short.
"Shad!"
The dolly smacked hard into the hind legs of the ones in front,
who had stopped two mechanical strides later.
Six boxy clusters of sensors and cameras swivelled
to point back the way they had come.

That's when Iffy heard it:
the rhythmic *clunk clunk clunk* of exoskeletoned feet on concrete.
Iñacio was already on his feet
with something that looked like a high-pressure paint sprayer in his hands.
"Only thing that doesn't have a lock-out,"
he said.

Iffy was already unlooping the cables around the bots' necks.
"Listen,"
she said,
squatting in front of the one she had repaired
so that her head and its sensors were on the same level.
"I know we're not who you were s'posed t' be guardin',
but those folk back there?
They're *really* not s'posed t' be here."
She fished the screwdriver out of her pocket and held it up.
"You fix that an' I promise,
I'll do my best t' fix you all."

She had no reason to believe the bot could understand her.
Its core had probably been imprinted with a dog's mind
like Doctor Johel's armored G-80 back in Rothera.
There was no telling what strange loops it might have formed
in the century it had spent patrolling these abandoned tunnels.
For all she knew it would take one look at the Marines
and decide they were its true masters.

The bot took a step forward and to butted her gently with its head,
then turned and disappeared into the darkness
with its two companions at its heels.

The fourth bot rose onto its three good legs.
It didn't make a sound,
but Iffy imagined that if it could have whined it would have.
"They'll be aright,"
she told it as she took her seat on the dolly,
wishing she believed her own words.

The first explosion echoed through the tunnel a few minutes later.
"Increase speed to full,"
Iñacio snapped at the harnessed bots.
Gunfire chattered behind them—Iffy couldn't tell how far away—and then
the sound-shock of another explosion rolled past them.

"Get down!" she ordered
The three-legged bot had risen to its feet again,
its body swaying slightly as its algorithms steadied its misbalanced weight
atop the dolly.

"I said get—affin' heck, look out!"
Iffy ducked
as the three-legged bot jumped over her.
The dolly slewed wildly,
skidded,
and straightened out.

The tunnel was climbing now,
a long steady incline that Iffy hoped would lead to
the surface or the secret Niobium base
or whatever it had been built to distract from.
The first painted stripe on the wall flew past so quickly that
she wasn't sure she had seen it.
A second, then a third with a six-digit number stenciled next to it,
and then the tunnel leveled out and automatic lights came on over their heads,
turning everything the dark red she associated with night watches.

The bots slowed and stopped
as the dolly rolled into a dimly-lit space several times larger
than the bunker they had left.
A blast door slid closed behind them,
metal scraping on stone for the first time in a century.
They had arrived.

"Lights on?" Iñacio said after a moment.
"*Acendé luz?*
*Lampo roshan kon?*"

The three-legged bot made a high-pitched whining sound.
Iffy squinted as clinically-white strips in the walls and ceiling obediently lit up,
then sucked in her breath.
She had hoped they would find a workshop
and feared it would be a graveyard,
but this—she hadn't expected this.

Six thick cylinders lay on their sides in two rows of three,
each one surrounded by pipes and machinery.
A bulky mass made of meter-square bricks loomed in the background.
The three-armed logo painted on its side was redundant:
even before schematics took shape in her head
she recognized the reactor for what it was.

One of the cylinders had been opened.
She and Iñacio exchanged looks.
He nodded as if to answer a question she hadn't asked,
then hefted the thing that looked like a paint sprayer
and edged forward cautiously.

She held her breath as he neared the cylinder,
only letting it out when he glanced inside and lowered the sprayer.
"'S empty," he said,
sounding as relieved as she felt.
"An' look—one o' th' suits is missin' too."
He gestured at the wall to their left
where five silvered body suits hung from swing-out racks
in front of matching boots and helmets.

"Stay here,"
Iffy told the bots.
Singh, Velikov, DiOrio, Yuen, Boghosian—and Johnson.
The label above the missing suit read "Johnson",
but what did "High Medina" mean,
and where had she seen that logo before?
A red circle with a green crescent set into it,
a four-pointed white star…

"They were Martians!" she blurted.
"It was in one o' my history sims.
Some trillionaire gave up on fixin' th' world
an' wanted t' run away t' Mars.
They got a few rockets up b'fore space got affed up
an' then—"
She shrugged,
slightly embarrassed by how excited she had momentarily sounded.
Honesty had teased her once about being a space geek
and she had never mentioned it to der again.
"Th' machine wars started an' nobody ever heard anythin' more from them."

Iñacio nodded, stony-faced.
"I know th' story.
Coulda saved a million trees or a million lives
with what they spent tryin' t' get away from what they'd done."
He hefted the sprayer again,
and for a moment she thought he might use it on the empty cylinder.
"You ever meet any o' my folk an' they call you an astronaut,
it ain't a compliment."

"But what're they doin' here?"
Iffy walked past the motionless bots harnessed to the dolly
and ran a finger along one of the unopened cylinders.
"An' who's been cleanin' this all these years?"

The crippled bot on the dolly surged to its feet.
The panel on its back flipped open.
A stubby needle gun popped up.
Its targeting laser drew a thin red line through the air
to a squat four-wheeled service bot
that had just rolled into view from somewhere further back in the chamber.

The service bot froze and made a warbling sound.
The three-legged bot tilted its head toward Iffy.
"Um, sure," she said helplessly.
The laser blinked off,
but the sentry bot stayed on its feet
as the service bot began to wipe down the nearest cylinder
with a brush whose bristles had long since worn away.

Iñacio swiped an app set into a work table next to one of the cylinders
and studied the displays that appeared.
"Reconciliation Team Beta,"
he read aloud.
"Alpha's in a shelter east o' here
an' Gamma 'n' Delta are 'round th' other way."
He frowned.
"This doesn't make any sense.
They all have cryogenization an' the same date,
but then decryogenization on different dates."

"So they all got unfrozen at different times,"
Iffy said,
shrugging.

Iñacio shook his head.
"That's what's weird about it.
Accordin' to this,
they all got unfrozen *before* they were frozen, not after."
He cleared his throat.
"And,
um,
those five?
They all got a flag beside their names that says 'nonviable'.
Only one marked green is Johnson."

Iffy hunched her shoulders inside her parka and shivered.
She was hungry and needed a bathroom
and she was tired of being in places where people were dead.
"That thing show you a way outta here?"

The Ecologist shrugged.
"Th' tunnel that way gets us to Alpha,
or we can go th' other way to Gamma.
There's another one into th' Niobium thing,
an' from there we can get to whatever's in th' middle of all this.
'Scuse me."
He stepped aside to let the service bot roll past him on its rounds.

He looked as tired as she felt,
Iffy realized,
and felt a pang for not having thought about it before.
"Maybe there's bunks in back or somethin'?" she hazarded.

"Nah."
Iñacio shook his head.
"This place wasn't for workin' or livin'.
This was a warehouse.
An' anyway,
we gotta keep movin'.
Those bots mighta slowed th' Marines down,
but they won't'a stopped 'em."

Iffy *really* wanted a bathroom,
but she had once stood an eight-hour watch on the *Guinevere*
when Aunt Naggie was sick
without a single break
despite six cups of tea.
"Th' hell with whatever they were doin' down here,"
she said.
"Let's get to th' base and figure out a way outta this mess."

The service bot pivoted on its wheels to face her.
"The way out is simple, Citizen Kwan,"
a familiar voice said.
"All you have to do is stay where you are
so that my team can collect you without any more theatrics.
Your friend goes about his business,
you help me with mine,
and we all get a happy ending."

Iñacio hefted the sprayer and aimed it at the bot.
"Now, now,"
the governor's voice chided.
"I have no idea if that still works and neither do you.
Even if it does,
you're sixty meters underground and breathing recycled air.
Do you really want to set things on fire?"

Iñacio hesitated.
"I s'pose not," he said,
setting it down beside the dolly.
And then casually,
as if it was the most natural thing in the world,
he slipped the loops of cables off the two sentry bots harnessed that had been pulling them
and shouted,
"Get 'em!"

The bots didn't move.

The governor's voice chuckled.
"Did you really think that would—"

"Target!"
Iffy snapped,
pointing.
The gun on the back of the three-legged bot barked twice.
The first shot punched a hole through the service bot.
The second caught it off-center and sent it spinning across the floor.

"What—"
Iñacio started.

"You just gotta know how t' talk to 'em,"
Iffy said,
grabbing a couple of tools out of her crate and stuffing them into her pockets.
"C'mon.
We gotta get a leg on."

The tunnel at the other end of the bunker had a blast door
to match the one that had closed behind them.
Iffy closed her eyes and rooted around in her not-memories of this place.
There.
She traced a shape on a contact pad beside the door,
then gasped as it slid open to reveal a pair of Marines,
their gun-arms pointed straight at her and Iñacio.

"Oh rabbit,"
the governor's voice said,
and for a moment Iffy could almost believe the sympathy in his voice was genuine.
"Did you really think you could find a hole deep enough to hide from *me*?"

Iffy felt rather than saw the three-legged bot begin to move.
"No!" she shouted,
lunging to stop it
as if it was a pet rat or a drone she had just spent hours building out of spare parts.
Its gun fired twice
but it was already falling as the Marines' auto-targeted shots
hit the knee joint in its remaining front leg.

She was falling too.
Something had knocked the breath out of her.
She was lying on the concrete and it *hurt*,
it hurt so much that she couldn't even cry out,
not yet,
because the shot had gone right through her
just above her hip
and when she tried to breathe it felt like someone was kneeling on her back
and squeezing all the air out of her.

Iñacio was shouting her name.
She was pretty sure it was Iñacio.
She could hear the governor's voice barking order too.
"No, don't," she tried to say
as exoskeletoned arms picked her up,
but the words came out as a gasp
and now she could breathe again
and the hurt spread through her like milk poured into tea.

Her head lolled to the side as the Marine placed her on a nearby work table.
Iñacio was shouting and struggling to free himself from the other Marine's grip,
which was working about as well as the time
she had tried to pull herself free from Aunt Naggie
after having her first and only temper tantrum outside the Sandhus' shop
when she was eight years old.
She couldn't remember what she had wanted so badly,
but it didn't matter.

The Marine who had picked her up had put a patch on her arm
to take the pain away
except it was more like taking her away from the pain.
She floated inside her own body as if it was a warm bath
while the Marine sliced open her parka with a very sharp knife
and squeezed cold pink goo into the hole der needle gun had made.
She supposed she was lucky it had been an armor-piercing round.
She didn't think the Marine would have enough goo to fill
the hole that the other kind would have made.

*«unanticipated / unforeseen»*

"Oh there you are."
She didn't know if she had said the words out loud or not.
*Are you going to shoot me too?*

*«inspection»*

The machine thought was clouded and soft-edged instead of crystal clear.
Without warning she was suspended beside a schematic of herself,
alone in a pocket universe constructed solely for this temporary purpose.
The fractalized patches of cells scattered through her body glistened blue-white,
but there and there and there they were red,
red for danger,
red like the blood on the work table underneath her.
They would heal—the tweaks in her genes were quadruply redundant to make sure of that—but
healing would take time
and that was something she/they/the world didn't have enough of right now.

"Sh sh sh," the Marine said softly.
An armored hand brushed gently against her cheek.
Her last thought before all her thoughts went away was,
*Honesty?*

She woke in a bed—an actual bed with sheets,
not a cot or a bunk or her sleeping bag.
Gray light came through a small window set high in the wall.
It was probably too small for her to get through anyway,
she thought dully.
She frowned.
Why would she need to—oh.

She sat up and winced.
Someone had replaced her clothes with gray cotton shorts
and a matching tank top.
The bandage stuck to her stomach,
on the other hand,
was a bright, shiny blue.
She slid her hand gingerly around to her back
and felt a matching square there.

A pair of slippers waited patiently on the floor.
She turned,
wincing again,
and slid her feet into them.
Could she stand?
Yes.
She wasn't even light-headed,
though she was as thirsty as she'd ever been.
And she didn't need a bathroom nearly as much as she had
before she'd been shot,
which made her wonder about exactly what kind of care she might have received
while she was unconscious.

A dressing gown hung on the back of the door.
It was locked,
of course,
but even if it hadn't been
she wasn't quite ready to face whatever lay on its other side.
She had been *shot*.
She could have died,
and—

She sniffled angrily and wiped her face on the dressing gown.
She really had thought they could escape,
and now she just felt stupid.

She lay back down on the bed (carefully) and closed her eyes.
A moment later she squeezed her lids shut more tightly,
but it didn't help.
The schematic of herself wasn't there any more.
Nothing was,
not even a simple wireframe of a hammer.
All she could see was the dots and swirls that everyone saw behind their eyelids.

Something cold stirred in her belly.
Maybe the loss was temporary.
Maybe things had just gone back to the way they were
and images would appear when they wanted to instead of on demand.
Or maybe it was gone for good and she could get on with her life,
though she knew it couldn't ever be what it had been.
She had wanted so much to move on,
to go somewhere and be someone and have an adventure,
and now that it had actually happened she still wanted all of that,
she just wanted a choice
instead of having things happen to her.
Mysteries,
it turned out,
were a lot more fun in sims.

She didn't know who to expect if the door opened.
The governor?
If so, which one?
Not that it seemed to matter much.
Would it be Iñacio,
looking worried,
or Johnson Wales with an apology?
Or would it be Honesty?
She was pretty sure the Marine who had given her first aid
hadn't actually been Honesty,
just another teenager with a narrow chin and button nose
temporarily possessed by someone who had been dead longer than
the people frozen in the bunker had been waiting for someone to defrost their remains.

She was still thirsty,
but she was tired too,
so she closed her eyes and let sleep take her away.

She woke in an actual bed with sheets
rather than her sleeping bag on the *Guinevere*.
Gray light came through a small window high in the wall.
She sat up and winced.
Someone had dressed her in gray cotton shorts and a matching tank top.
The bandage stuck to her stomach was bright blue.
She felt on her back,
somehow already knowing she would find a matching one there.

She slid her feet into the slippers waiting on the floor
and frowned as she took the dressing gown from the back of the door
and slid her arms into the sleeves.
She had never worn slippers or a dressing gown in her life—she only knew them
from Aunt Naggie's romance sims.
But it all felt somehow familiar,
as did her thirst.

She sat back down on the bed and closed her eyes,
willing a schematic of herself to appear.
Nothing happened.
All she could see was the dots and swirls that everyone saw.

*Phosphenes,* she thought.
They were called phosphenes,
but how did she know that?
Panic roiled in her gut,
cold and slippery as if she had somehow swallowed a live jellyfish.

That thought pulled her back to her feet.
She knew the door would be locked,
but she tested the handle anyway.
"Well shad," she said aloud as it opened with a faint click.

The hall outside was as featureless as her room.
The floor was tiled with squares of slate-colored linoleum
just like the ones in the Sandhus' store.
The walls and ceiling were iceberg gray.
She couldn't see where the light was coming from
or how far the corridor went:
it seemed to stretch away forever in both directions.
The doors were rectangular outlines with handles
identical to the one that had just closed behind her with another faint click.

"Hello?"
She took a step, then hesitated.
She was sure the lettering on the door opposite her hadn't been there a moment before.
Was it motion-sensitive?
She stepped back:
the letters stayed visible.
They definitely *were* letters,
so why couldn't she read them?

"Hello?" she said again.
Her words disappeared without an echo as if she had never spoken,
but now she could hear something in the distance
like the steady *shush shush shush* of waves against the side of a ship.
That sound had been a constant background in her life
for as long as she could remember,
just like the smell of the sea.

The smell.
She could smell the ocean.
Wherever she was,
she was close to salt water.
Halley?
Rothera?
Another secret hideout somewhere?
There seemed to be a surprising number of those scattered around Antarctica,
although to be honest,
she wasn't really sure how many would have been unsurprising.

She hesitated again before grasping the handle in front of her.
It resisted for a moment, then turned with a click and pulled it open.

The room inside was identical to the one she had woken up in,
right down to the rumpled sheet on the bed.
All of a sudden she was tired as well as thirsty,
so she lay down on it and closed her eyes and let sleep take her away.

She woke in an actual bed with sheets.
Gray light came through a small window.
The bandage stuck to her stomach under her gray cotton tank top was bright blue.
Its twin tugged at the skin on her back
as she kicked the slippers on the floor aside and opened the door.
The hall outside was tiled with slate-colored linoleum squares.
*Just like the Sandhus',* she thought.
The light came from nowhere in particular,
painting the walls and ceiling iceberg gray.

The door behind her closed with a faint click.
There was lettering on the door opposite her,
but opening it felt—she lowered her hand.
She and Jeep had played hive a few times.
The thought of opening the door gave her the same feeling as
the thought of placing a piece exactly where her opponent wanted her to.

The corridor stretched away to infinity in both directions.
Waves shushed in the distance
and the tang of salt water tickled her nose
as she considered her options.
It all seemed familiar.
How many times had she been here before?
How many of these doors had she opened,
only to find herself back in the room she had left?

Sometimes the only way to win was not to play.
She sat on the floor with her back against the wall and closed her eyes.
Phosphenes danced behind her eyelids.
She hugged herself so that her hands were hidden in her armpits
and pinched hard.
That felt real,
but that didn't mean anything.
If this was some kind of virtual reality,
whatever machine she was plugged into could simulate a pinch
just as easily as it could make her believe
there was a wall behind her back
or that she was thirsty.

"I ain't playin' no more," she said aloud.
The corridor swallowed her words without even a trace of an echo.
She wrapped her arms around her knees and put her head down on her knees to wait.

Her shoulders tensed involuntarily when she heard a door open somewhere in the distance.
She kept her head down as footsteps approached.
Fabric rustled as someone sat opposite her.

"You really are quite extraordinary,"
the governor said without preamble.
"If circumstances were different I would probably offer you a job of some sort."
He chuckled.
"I suspect that if I did that,
I would be working for *you* in rather short order."

Iffy didn't move.

"I'm not actually a villain,"
the governor continued gently.
"I admit I've done some terrible things,
but every single one of them was absolutely necessary.
Things are getting worse,
Citizen Kwan,
and we still can't see the bottom of the pit.
Every time we think we've patched a hole in the world,
entropy breaks through in a dozen other places.
Your ecologist and his friends think they can save enough to start over,
but simulation after simulation says they're wrong.
Even the machines seem to be afraid these days,
though what they seem to be afraid of most,
surprisingly,
is you."

Fabric rustled again as he stood.
"For what it's worth,
I'm sorry.
If there was another way to do this—"

Iffy waited for him to finish his sentence.
The moment stretched and stretched.
"Are you gonna kill me?"
she asked,
her voice muffled by her knees.

"No,"
the governor said neutrally.
"You're just not going to be yourself for a while."
He sighed.
"Quite a long while, in fact.
Goodbye, Citizen Kwan.
Believe it or not,
it has been a pleasure."

Without warning her thirst was back,
more powerful than ever before.
She was almost grateful as she fell into something deeper and darker than sleep.

## Chapter 14

It took half an hour to collect the other two bags that Wales had thrown off the train.
Iffy didn't ask how he had snuck aboard without being detected,
or how he had managed to get off.
As they trudged back to the waiting escape pod her thoughts were on her First.
Third had mostly looked after her with Fourth's occasional grudging help.
Iffy could remember an old woman with dark eyes and a sun-wrinkled face,
but that was about all.

Dinner was a double helping of cold ration bars.
*At least these ones taste diff'rent,*
Iffy thought as she chewed and swallowed.

Wales waited until she was done before giving her the rest of his news.
Halley's governor was locked away somewhere,
Paddington's was missing,
Brazilian ships were patrolling the coast,
and the *Guinevere* was still docked in Rothera.
"As bait," he shrugged.

She nodded and gave him an abbreviated version of her escape with Iñacio
and what had happened in Bharati.
His expression soured when she described the imprinted soldiers she had encountered.
"I've always wondered what actually happened.
But yours is just…gone?"

Iffy shrugged.
"I think so.
Can't talk t' her no more,
an' I don't think I got any o' her skills.
Tell you th' truth,
I kinda miss her.
It was like havin' a big sister or somethin'."
She hesitated.
"Any chance you seen Aunt Naggie or Honesty?
De got der call-up just before things blew up."

"You can blame the governor for that," Wales said.
"When Rothera's core told him you two were a thing
he thought he could der for leverage.
I'm sorry I didn't—"

"Stop sayin' that."
Iffy crumpled the ration bar's wrapper into a ball
and stuffed it into the little recycler Wales had unpacked.
"Stop sayin' you're sorry about this an' you regret that an' whatever.
It don't fix anything."

"Sorry,"
Wales said after a moment's pause,
then spread his hands when Iffy glared at him.

He stood and stretched.
"We probably shouldn't stay here much longer.
How about I rig myself a seat on this crash bucket of yours
while you figure out what we're going to do next?"

"I already know th' what,"
she said.
"What I gotta figure out is how."
She hesitated,
remembering what had happened when she and Sandrine had stolen the hovercraft.
"Don't s'pose you brought any o' my medicine with you?"

Wales shook his head.
"Sorry, but—okay, okay, um,
*unfortunately* it would have been too risky.
As far as I know the only supply in Rothera is on board your ship,
and if I'd tried to get it…"
He shrugged,
not needing to finish his sentence.

"Yeah."
Iffy rummaged around for a moment,
then pulled a sterile wipe out of the escape pod's medical kit,
tore it in half,
and stuffed the pieces in her nostrils.
"Here we go."

*Imagine being born with cataracts in your eyes,
unable to see anything more than blurs of light.
Now imagine that one day someone removed them.
You would still only see blurs
because your brain would never have had a chance to learn that
this pattern is a wall
and this other pattern is a chair.
People might have told you that things looked smaller if they were far away,
but the words alone wouldn't mean anything.
It would be weeks or months before you could make sense of
the signals your eyes were now able to send to your brain,
but it would get easier with practice.*

*Later,
lying in a sleeping bag in a tent two hundred kilometers away
while Wales spread a net of thermally superconductive cables around them
to hide the heat of their bodies from infrared sensors,
Iffy wondered whether talking to the machines was getting easier
because she had been doing it more often
or because of her time with Sandrine
or because she now knew where her ability had come from.
In the end she decided it didn't matter.
What mattered was that diving into that other world of information
felt more like opening her eyes
each time she did it.
Finding what she wanted was no more difficult now than reaching for a cup of tea,
and what had once seemed as chaotic as the Dance Hall market in Rothera
was now full of currents and rhythms and poetry.
She didn't understand it yet,
but for the first time she felt that she might.*

*And for the first time,
she had a plan.*
