I have just posted a [30-minute video of my talk "Software Engineering's Greatest Hits"][video].
In brief:
software engineering researchers have learned a lot over the last 50 years,
but most working programmers don't even know that knowledge exists.
I think the way to close that knowledge gap is to teach a bit of data science to undergraduate computer scientists
so that they'll understand what claims are actually being made,
and _then_ tell them what we currently think we know.
To make this work,
I think we have to teach data science using software engineering data and examplesâ€”there are
lots of good generic data science courses out there,
but most people learn best and fastest when the examples are directly relevant to their own domain.
A course like this would fit into the curriculum and be culturally defensible ("Look, math!")
and I think it would also be very popular with students ("Look, data science!").
And if I've learned anything in the last 20 years,
it's that simply presenting the results bounces off:
if it was going to work, it would have by now.
I hope you'll enjoy the talk - comments and feedback are very welcome.
