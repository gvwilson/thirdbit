I'm starting work as a software engineer with [Deep Genomics](https://www.deepgenomics.com/) tomorrow;
here's what I've done in the three weeks since I left Metabase:

- Ran a workshop on [Managing Research Software Projects](@root/mrsp/)
  to raise money for [MetaDocencia](https://www.metadocencia.org/).

- Wrote 43 posts on empirical software engineering research
  for [It Will Never Work in Theory](https://neverworkintheory.org/).

- Started acting as client and product owner for some projects based on
  [*Software Design by Example Using JavaScript*](@root/sdxjs/)
  for Mike Hoye's software engineering course at the University of Toronto.

- Starting playing the clarinet
  (because tenosynovitis in my right hand meant I had to give up guitar).

- Revised a middle-grade novel titled [*Maddy Roo*](@root/fiction/maddy-roo/)
  (furries versus robots with a bit of family drama)â€”if you'd like to give it a read,
  I'd be grateful for feedback.

- Started co-authoring a paper on how to make scientific publications more accessible.

- Started co-authoring an update to "[Software Carpentry: Lessons Learned](https://f1000research.com/articles/3-62)".
