For this year's [National Novel Writing Month](https://nanowrimo.org/)
I revised a YA novel called *Maddy Roo*
about a teenage kangaroo whose little sister is kidnapped by robots.
You can read the whole thing as [HTML](@root/fiction/maddy-roo/).
I hope you enjoy it;
[feedback](mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com) would be greatly appreciated.
