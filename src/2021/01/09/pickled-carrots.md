By popular request,
here is my spouse's recipe for pickled carrots,
which is derived from the one in Topp and Howard's excellent
<cite><a href="https://fireflybooks.com/catalogue/adult-books/cooking-food-drink/product/9079-the-complete-book-of-small-batch-preserving-over-300-recipes-to-use-year-round">The Complete Book of Small-Batch Preserving</a></cite>.
Note that this is a canning recipe, not a cold pickle.
Note also that the original recipe calls for only ¼ tsp of hot pepper flakes per jar,
to which we say, "Bah."

| Medieval | ingredient | metric |
| -------- | ---------- | ------ |
| 3 tbsp   | finely chopped fresh oregano or 1 tbsp (15 mL) dried | 45 mL |
| 1-3 tsp  | hot pepper flakes (per jar) | 5-15 mL |
| 2        | small cloves garlic | 2 |
| 1 lb     | peeled baby carrots | 500 g |
| 1 ½ cups | white vinegar | 375 mL |
| ½ cup    | granulated sugar | 125 mL |
| ⅓ cup    | water | 75 mL |
| 1 tsp    | pickling salt | 1 mL |

1.  Remove the hot jars from the canner and add one garlic clove and your desired volume of chili flakes to each jar.

1.  Pack in the carrots (see picture) leaving 1cm (½ inch) of head space.

1.  Combine vinegar, sugar, water, and salt in a small saucepan and bring to a boil.

1.  Pour hot liquid over carrots (in jars) to within ½ inch of the top.

1.  Process for canning: 15 minutes for 500 mL jars.

A 2lb (approx. 1kg) bag of baby carrots will make 1750 mL of pickle.
We usually use 250 mL wide-mouth jars—they make great gifts.
