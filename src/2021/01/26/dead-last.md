Ask a bunch of programmers what social and technical factors matter to them the most,
then rank the results.
The top five are:

<ol start="1">
  <li>Manager (everyone wants a good one)</li>
  <li>Perceived productivity</li>
  <li>Rewards</li>
  <li>Team culture</li>
  <li>Skills are well used</li>
</ol>

The least important five (out of 40 categories):

<ol start="36">
  <li>Lateral move opportunities</li>
  <li>Training for engineering technologies</li>
  <li>Training for soft skills</li>
  <li>Private office / number of people in workplace</li>
  <li>Training for engineering tools</li>
</ol>

That's right:
everyone wants a good manager and a good team culture,
but they place training in the soft skills those things need almost at the bottom of the list.
And everyone wants to feel they're productive,
but being taught how to use tools well is dead last among programmers' priorities.
I don't know how this compares to rankings in other professions,
but it makes me feel sad about ours.
