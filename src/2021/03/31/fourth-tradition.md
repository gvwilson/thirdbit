[Tedre2008](https://doi.org/10.1080/08993400802332332) describes three
traditions that have shaped how we think about computing: the mathematical,
which focuses on algorithms and proofs; the scientific, which studies programs
and programmers empirically; and the engineering tradition, which centers the
fact that computing matters because we can actually build useful things.

That paper changed how I think about our field, but in the past few years I have
realized that another point of view is just as important, though not as well
respected.  It draws on humanities and social sciences to explore questions
like, "Who does this help?", "Who does this hurt?", and, "Who decides?"  Just as
the most interesting software engineering research these days is look at how the
way we think interacts with the way we program, the most interesting thinking
about computing as a whole is coming from people who have outgrown the "Wernher
von Braun" mentality.
