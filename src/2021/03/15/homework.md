As we were sorting through the carefully-organized boxes in the basement after my dad died
we found some homework assignments he had graded in 1985 in Australia but hadn't handed back to the students
He had moved them from one place to another for 55 years because he couldn't in good conscience throw them out.
We did, but afterward I thought we should have sent them back to the local newspaper or the school or something
in that little town in New South Wales and asked them to return them to any of the students they could find.
