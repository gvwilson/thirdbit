## 1997

PF: Hi, I'm a programmer.  I just founded an online retail company. What do you two do?

GD: Hi, I'm a graphic designer. I know how to select and arrange text and images in ways that are appealing, informative, and usable.

MA: And I'm in marketing. I know how to identify people's needs and craft messages that will appeal to them.

PF: Huh. Those both seem much simpler to me than programming. I don't think I need to hire you.

## 2003

GD &amp; MA: So, how did your startup do?

PF: It tanked. People kept saying the site was ugly and confusing. I guess I should have hired you back in '97 after all.

## 2012

PF: Hi, I'm a programmer. I just founded an online education company. What do you do?

TE: Hi, I'm a teacher. I know how to select and arrange learning materials in ways that are appealing, informative, and effective.

PF: Huh. That seems simpler to me than programmingâ€¦

## 2021

PF: And what do *you* do?

ML: Machine learning.

PF: You mean you can automatically make lessons more effective and tell us how to make videos and autograded exercises more engaging?

ML: Uh, what?

PF: Cool! When can you start?
