I dreamed again last night about a magic USB drive.
If I held it in my hand and thought hard about the files I wanted,
then plugged the drive into my computer,
the files would be there.
A finished version of the YA novel I've been working on sporadically,
the tech books I'm either [struggling with](@root/2021/05/17/two-books/)
or just [wishing for](@root/ideas/#what-i-would-write-if-i-was-smarter-than-i-am)—they
would just *be* there,
fully formed and ready to share with the world,
along with the complete source code of the [programming tools](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1039534)
I've wanted for the last 20 years
and the albums [Ike Quebec](@root/talks/late-night/) never recorded.

Then the exuberance of the birds in our back yard woke me up
and I had to return a world in which my hands hurt when I type
and my brain hurts when I word.
Iffy won't escape from Antarctica by magic;
the errors and inconsistencies in *[SDXJS](@root/sdxjs/)* won't correct themselves,
and as for the programming tools and jazz,
you can only have everything you want in dreams and sometimes not even then.

But the birds sound happy
and the rain has stopped long enough that I can get in a good bike ride.
I may not dream about things like that,
but I enjoy them.
Time to start my day…
