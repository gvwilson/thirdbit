I'm starting a new job as a software engineer with [Deep Genomics](https://www.deepgenomics.com/) next week.
I'm looking forward to writing Python for a living again after a decade of doing other things,
but hope I'll be able to wrap up these side projects soon as well:

- running workshops on [Managing Research Software Projects](@root/mrsp/)

- acting as client and product owner for some projects based on
  [*Software Design by Example Using JavaScript*](@root/sdxjs/)
  for Mike Hoye's software engineering course at the University of Toronto

- finishing [*SDXJS*](@root/sdxjs/)
  and its companion *Building Software Together*

- finishing the paper "[Twelve Quick Tips for Software Design](https://github.com/gvwilson/12-design/)"

- co-authoring a paper on how to make scientific publications more accessible

- co-authoring an update to "[Software Carpentry: Lessons Learned](https://f1000research.com/articles/3-62)"

- publicizing [*Research Software Engineering with Python*](@root/py-rse/)

- writing at least two new posts a week on empirical software engineering research
  for [It Will Never Work in Theory](https://neverworkintheory.org/)

- finishing and submitting a middle-grade novel titled *Maddy Roo*
  (furries versus robots with a bit of family drama)

- learning to play the clarinet
  (because tenosynovitis in my right hand means I have to give up guitar)

- renovating our kitchen
  (a carpenter is going to do most of the work, but I'm going to help where I can)

- exercising frequently enough to keep my blood pressure at a safe level

- getting my [Hive](https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=hive) rating up to 300
  (if you'd like a game, I'm gvwilson on BGA)
