One of the silver linings of lockdown is that it gives us more time to cook.
This week's dinners (all vegan) are:

1.  Baked potatoes with chili and coleslaw.
2.  Gua bao with sweet potato belly.
3.  Laksa lemak (a rich Malaysian curry).
4.  Char kuey teow.
5.  Home-made pizza (there *might* be some cheese on one of them).
6.  Peddler's noodles.
7.  Mac'n'trees (vegan mac'n'cheese with roasted broccoli on top).
