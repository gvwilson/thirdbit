title: "Last Day at RStudio"

Today was my last day at RStudio.
I'm sad to leave,
particularly given how clumsy the company has been with certified and in-flight trainers,
but I'm grateful to everyone in the R community who made me feel welcome.
I don't know what comes next,
but I think I'm going to spend the next couple of weeks
polishing [*Software Design by Example Using JavaScript*](@root/sdxjs/),
trying to get another short story out the door,
and working on some guitar chords.
If you're hiring,
I'd enjoy hearing from you.
