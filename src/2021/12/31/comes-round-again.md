Another year over; what have I learned?

- A story I wrote after my brother died
  [was published by *On Spec*](https://onspecmag.wpcomstaging.com/2021/01/06/issue-115-coming-soon/);
  you can read it [here](@root/fiction/fall-behind/).
  I received over a dozen rejections and didn't make any other sales,
  but decided to self-publish a novel called *Beneath Coriandel*;
  I hope you like it.

- *[Research Software Engineering with Python](@root/py-rse/)* was published.
  It took a lot longer than originally planned,
  but I'm very grateful to have worked with Damien, Kate, Luke, Joel, and Charlotte.

- Danielle Smalls and I published
  "[Ten quick tips for staying safe online](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008563)".

- RStudio laid me off.
  I don't understand why,
  or why I wasn't allowed to try to find another role within the company,
  but [asteroids happen](@root/2021/02/20/asteroids-and-dinosaurs/).
  What angers me is how they fumbled the wind-down of the instructor certification program:
  a lot of people worked hard to get certified,
  and I think they deserved better.

- I went through a bunch of job interviews.
  Some companies, like [Automattic](https://artiss.blog/2019/03/the-automattic-hiring-process/),
  do a great job of explaining the process and trying to make it fair.
  Othersâ€”well,
  [here's what happened with Canonical](@root/2021/09/13/iq-and-personality-tests/).

- I spent six months with [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/)
  then moved to a straight-up programming position at [Deep Genomics](https://www.deepgenomics.com/).
  I'm really enjoying coding for a living again after so many years,
  but a little dumbfounded by how much Python now looks like Enterprise Java.

- We mothballed the TidyBlocks project:
  we'd reached the limits of what we could do as volunteers
  and [nobody wanted to fund it](@root/2021/07/22/whatever-happened-to-tidyblocks/).

- I finished [*Software Design by Example Using JavaScript*](@root/sdxjs/),
  but [there hasn't been a lot of interest](@root/2021/11/23/not-what-i-set-out-to-do/),
  so I decided to publish it on Leanpub
  until I can figure out what's wrong with my beliefs about what programmers want to learn.

- I ran [a workshop on managing research software projects](@root/mrsp/)
  to help raise money for [MetaDocencia](https://www.metadocencia.org/).
  There was much less interest in it than I expected,
  so once again I'm going to pause any further development
  until I figure out what's wrong with my mental model of what my hoped-for audience wants.

- I revived [It Will Never Work in Theory](https://neverworkintheory.org/),
  which publishes short reviews of software engineering research papers
  that practitioners might be interested in.
  Posts get a median of just over a hundred views,
  which is either a lot (compared to the number of people who read academic research papers)
  or not (compared to the number of people who read fact-free blather on Hacker News).
  I'll write more about this in the new year.

- I had to stop playing guitar because of
  [tenosynovitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigger_finger) in my right hand.
  I've picked up the tenor sax again in its place,
  which I'm probably enjoying more than our neighbors.

- I got [another tattoo](@root/2021/07/22/knitting-mouse/)
  to commemorate my mother and sister.
  I hope they would have liked it.

- Favorite book: *[Driftwood](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51600238-driftwood)*
  by [Marie Brennan](https://www.swantower.com/).

- Favorite movie: *Free Guy*.
  It's not great art, but it was just what I needed.

- Favorite album: Elina Duni's *[Partir](http://elinaduni.com/music/partir/)*.

- Favorite moment: a waltz with my wife.
