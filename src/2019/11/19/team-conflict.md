*I wrote this guide ten years ago when I was supervising undergraduate
programming projects at the University of Toronto.  I hope it's still
useful.*

Grades just came back for the second assignment.  Your team got 51%,
which is far lower than you're used to.  The sick feeling in the pit
of your stomach has turned to anger: you did *your* part, and so
did most of the rest of the team, but Marta didn't turn in her stuff
until the very last minute, which meant that no one else had time to
spot the two big mistakes she'd made.  As for Chul, well, he didn't
turn his stuff in at all—again.  If something doesn't change, this
course is going to pull your GPA down so far that you might lose your
scholarship.

Situations like this come up all the time in the real world, and in
all parts of life.  Broadly speaking, there are four ways you can deal
with them:

- Cross your fingers and hope that things will get better on their
  own, even though the last eight times you hoped they would, they
  didn't.

- Do extra to make up for others' shortcomings.  This sometimes seems
  to work in the short term, and saves you the mental anguish of
  confronting others, but the time for that "extra" has to come from
  somewhere; what usually ends up happening is that other courses, or
  your personal life, suffer.

- Lose your temper and start shouting.  Unfortunately, people often
  wind up displacing their anger into other parts of their life: I've
  seen developers yell at waitresses for bringing incorrect change
  when what they really needed to do was tell their boss, "No, I
  *won't* work through another holiday weekend to make up for your
  decision to short-staff the project."

- Take constructive steps to fix the underlying problem.

Most of us find number four hard because we don't like confrontation.
If you manage confrontation properly, though, it is a lot less
bruising, which means that you don't have to be as afraid of
initiating it.  Also, if people believe that you will actually take
steps when they bully, lie, procrastinate, or do a half-assed job,
they will almost always pull up their socks.

Here are the steps you should take when you feel that a teammate isn't
pulling his or her weight:

Make sure you're not guilty of the same sin.
: You won't get very far complaining about someone else interrupting
  in meetings if you do it just as frequently.

Check expectations.
: Are you sure the offender knows what standards he is supposed to be
  meeting?  This is where a team contract comes in useful.

Document the offense.
: Write down what the offender has actually done, and why it's not
  good enough.  Doing this will help you clarify matters in your own
  mind.  It's also absolutely necessary if you have to escalate.

Check with other team members.
: Are you alone in feeling that the offender is letting the team down?
  If so, that doesn't necessarily mean you're wrong, but it'll be a
  lot easier to fix things if you have the support of the rest of the
  team.  (Finding out who else on the team is unhappy can be the
  hardest part of the whole process, since you can't even ask the
  question without letting on that you're upset, and word will almost
  certainly get back to whoever you're asking about, who might then
  turn around and accuse you of stirring up trouble.  After a couple
  of unhappy experiences of this kind, I've learned that it's best to
  raise the issue at a team meeting in front of everyone.)

Talk with the offender.
: This should be a team effort: put it on the agenda at a team
  meeting, present your complaint, and make sure that the offender
  understands it.  In most cases, this is enough: human beings are
  herd animals, and if someone realizes that they're going to be
  called on their hitchhiking or bad manners, they will usually change
  their ways.

Escalate as soon as there's a second offense.
: Hitchhikers and others who really don't have good intentions are
  counting on you giving them one "last chance" after another until
  the term is finished and they can go suck the life force out of
  their next victim.  *Don't fall into this trap.* If someone stole
  your laptop, you'd report it right away.  If someone steals your
  time or your grades, you're being pretty generous giving them even
  one chance to mend their ways.

In the context of a student project, "escalation" means "taking the
issue to the instructor".  (If you're reluctant to do this because you
don't want to be a snitch, go back and read what I just wrote about
people stealing your laptop.)  Of course, your instructor has probably
had dozens of students complain to her over the years about partners
and teammates not doing their share.  (It isn't uncommon to have both
halves of a pair tell the instructor that they're doing all the work.
This is one of the reasons I insist that students use version control
to manage their projects: it lets me check who's actually written
what.) In order to get her to take you seriously and help you fix your
problem, you should send her an email, signed by the whole team (or as
many as you can get on side) describing the problem and the steps you
have already taken to resolve it.  Make sure the offender gets a copy
as well, and ask your instructor to arrange a meeting to resolve the
issue.

This is where documentation (step three in the list above) is crucial.
Hitchhikers are usually very good at appearing reasonable; they're
very likely to nod as you present your case, then say, "Well, yes,
but…" and rhyme off a bunch of minor exceptions, or cases
where others on the team have also fallen short of expectations.  If
you can't back up your complaint, your instructor will likely be left
with the impression that the whole team is dysfunctional, and nothing
will improve.

One technique your instructor may ask you to use in a meeting of this
kind is **active listening**.  As soon as one person makes a
point, the person on the opposite side of the issue explains it back
to him, as in, "So what I think Igor is saying is…" This
guarantees that the second person has actually paid attention to what
the first person said.  It can also defuse a lot of tension, since
explaining your position back to you clearly forces the other person
to see the world through your eyes, if only for a few moments.

## What sort of people make teamwork hard?

Tolstoy wrote that all happy families resemble one another, but each unhappy
family is unhappy in its own way.  Similarly, all good team members share
certain characteristics, but bad ones can be bad in many different ways.  Here
are a few:

Anna
: knows more about every subject than everyone else on the team put
  together—at least, she thinks she does.  No matter what you say,
  she'll correct you; no matter what you know, she knows better.
  Annas are pretty easy to spot: if you keep track in team meetings of
  how often people interrupt one another, her score is usually higher
  than everyone else's put together.

Bao
: is a contrarian: no matter what anyone says, he'll take the opposite
  side.  This is healthy in small doses, but when Bao does it, there's
  always another objection lurking behind the first half dozen.

Caitlin
: has so little confidence in her own ability (despite her good
  grades) that she won't make any decision, no matter how small, until
  she has checked with someone else.  Everything has to be spelled out
  in detail for her so that there's no possibility of her getting
  anything wrong.

Frank
: believes that knowledge is power.  He enjoys knowing things that
  other people don't—or to be more accurate, he enjoys it when
  people know he knows things they don't.  Frank can actually make
  things work, but when asked how he did it, he'll grin and say, "Oh,
  I'm sure you can figure it out."

Hediyeh
: is quiet.  Very quiet.  She never speaks up in meetings, even when
  she knows that what other people are saying is wrong.  She might
  contribute to the mailing list, but she's very sensitive to
  criticism, and will always back down rather than defending her point
  of view.  Hediyeh isn't a troublemaker, but rather a lost
  opportunity.

Kenny
: is a hitchhiker.  He has discovered that most people would rather
  shoulder some extra work than snitch, and he takes advantage of it
  at every turn.  The frustrating thing is that he's so damn
  *plausible* when someone finally does confront him.  "There have
  been mistakes on all sides," he says, or, "Well, I think you're
  nit-picking."  The only way to deal with Kenny is to stand up to
  him: remember, if he's not doing his share, *he's the bad guy*, not
  you.

Melissa
: would easily have made the varsity procrastination team if she'd
  bothered to show up to tryouts.  She means well—she really does
  feel bad about letting people down—but somehow something always
  comes up, and her tasks are never finished until the last possible
  moment.  Of course, that means that everyone who is depending on her
  can't do their work until *after* the last possible moment…

Petra
: has a favorite phrase: "why don't we".  Why don't we write a GUI to
  help people edit the program's configuration files?  Hey, why don't
  we invent our own little language for designing GUIs?  Her energy
  and enthusiasm are hard to argue with, but argue you must.
  Otherwise, for every step you move forward, the project's goalposts
  will recede by two.  This is called **feature creep**, and has
  ruined many projects that might otherwise have delivered something
  small, but useful.

Raj
: is rude.  "It's just the way I talk," he says, "If you can't hack
  it, maybe you should find another team."  His favorite phrase is,
  "That's stupid," and he uses obscenity as casually as minor
  characters in Tarantino films.  His only redeeming grace is that he
  can't dissemble in front of the instructor as well as Kenny, so he's
  easier to get rid of.

Sergei
: is simply incompetent.  He doesn't understand the problem, he hasn't
  bothered to master the tools and libraries he's supposed to be
  using, the code he checks in doesn't compile, and his thirty-second
  bug fixes introduce more problems than they solve.  If he means
  well, try to re-partition the work so that he'll do less damage.  If
  he doesn't, he should be treated like any other hitchhiker.

## Irreconcilable Differences

Sometimes, it isn't just one person on the team who's a problem.
Sometimes, the whole team is dysfunctional.  In the mid-1990s, for
example, I worked in a data visualization startup.  Individually, we
were all smart, decent people.  Put us together, though, and somehow
our personalities and IQs canceled out, leaving us all dumb and nasty.

Instructors can allow for this by announcing at the start of the course that
teams will be dissolved and re-formed halfway through the project, *unless*
every member on the team submits a separate signed request to stay together.
There's a bit of psychology here: if people are required to ask for their team
to be dissolved, they will often think, "It's more trouble than it's worth, I'll
just put up with it."  If dissolution is the default, though, then students
won't be inhibited by any stigma attached to being the one who caused trouble.

Students also usually understand that dissolving their team and
forming a new one takes time that could be invested in earning a
higher grade.  In practice, therefore, teams will almost always choose
to stick together if they see that hitchhikers and rudies are actually
being dealt with.
