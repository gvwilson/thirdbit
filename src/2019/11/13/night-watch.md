"That's a nice song," said young Sam, and Vimes remembered that he was hearing it for the first time.

"It's an old soldiers' song," he said.

"Really, sarge? But it's about angels."

*Yes,* thought Vimes, *and it's amazing what bits those angels cause to rise up as the song progresses. It's a real soldiers' song: sentimental, with dirty bits.*

"As I recall, they used to sing it after battles," he said. "I've seen old men cry when they sing it," he added.

"Why? It sounds cheerful."

*They were remembering who they were not singing it with,* thought Vimes. *You'll learn. I know you will.*
