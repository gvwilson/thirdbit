Davey Alba's article for Buzzfeed about
[DataCamp's mishandling of an incident of sexual harassment](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/datacamp-sexual-harassment-metoo-tech-startup)
has just been published.
I think it's a well-written summary of what has happened to date,
and I am very grateful to her and to everyone who spoke to her for laying out the facts so clearly.
