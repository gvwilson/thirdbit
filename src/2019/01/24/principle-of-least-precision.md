title: "The Principle of Least Precision"
---

Another day,
another attempt to formalize something whose utility lies in its informality.
Rigor and precision have their place:
if someone asks,
"What's the semantics of slicing?"
and the project lead said, "I don't know, look at what the code does,"
it's time to join a different language development project.
But UML and the Semantic Web and [Loglan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loglan) failed to catch on on for good reasons.
Human beings aren't analytic machines;
we reason by analogy with what we've seen and done before
and only resort to logic when we've painted ourselves into a corner and have no other option.
Even in the purest of pure math,
our "proofs" are little more than stepping stones across a river
rather than an unimpeachable atomization of truth.

This is why I'm skeptical of anything with the word "ontology" in its title.
The more precisely we define a term like "author" or "species",
the less accessible we make that term's meaning.
(Go ahead, read [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorship_and_ownership_in_copyright_law_in_Canada)
and tell me if you feel enlightened.)
Yes,
a handful of people need precise definitions,
but I think a primary goal for any system should be
to make it unnecessary for users to think precisely,
because as Cherubini et al found over a decade ago,
[they're going to anyway](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/p557-cherubini.pdf).

*[The Soul of a New Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soul_of_a_New_Machine)*
has a quote from Tom West:
"Not everything worth doing is worth doing well."
Inspired by the [Principle of Least Astonishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment),
I'd like to propose a Principle of Least Precision,
and measure the success of a system by how much people can accomplish *without* having to split hairs.
