title: "Computing Skills Books for Researchers"
---

Thrice upon a time,
I ran [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) as a one-semester course at the University of Toronto.
I toyed with the idea of turning those notes into a textbook,
but [got a little sidetracked](https://f1000research.com/articles/3-62/v2).

I would now like to find books like the one I didn't writeâ€”books that offer
a wide-ranging introduction to key computing skills for researchers in a hands-on way,
rather than a deep dive into any single topic.
The few I know of include:

-   Haddock and Dunn: *[Practical Computing for Biologists](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Computing-Biologists-Steven-Haddock/dp/0878933913/)*
-   Scopatz and Huff: *[Effective Computation in Physics](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Computation-Physics-Research-Python-dp-1491901535/dp/1491901535/)*
-   Allesina and Wilmes: *[Computing Skills for Biologists](https://www.amazon.com/Computing-Skills-Biologists-Stefano-Allesina/dp/0691182752/)*
-   Machlis: *[Practical R for Mass Communication and Journalism](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Mass-Communication-Journalism-Chapman/dp/1138726915/)*
-   Paarsch and Golyaev: *[A Gentle Introduction to Effective Computing in Quantitative Research](https://www.amazon.ca/Introduction-Effective-Computing-Quantitative-Research/dp/0262034115/)*

If you know of others,
I'd be grateful for pointers.
