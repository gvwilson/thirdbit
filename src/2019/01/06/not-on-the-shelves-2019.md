title: "Not on the Shelves (2019 Edition)"
---

I made progress on two book projects last year:
*[Teaching Tech Together][t3]* is now "done",
and *[JavaScript versus Data Science][js4ds]*
should be out some time in February.
That means it's time to update my list of
[books that don't yet exist][shelves],
which I have found helps me figure out
what gaps exist in the literature that I could usefully fill.

I still believe that a good book can change the world;
If you'd like to help with any of the ideas in [my list][shelves] or take one on yourself,
please [let me know](mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com).
