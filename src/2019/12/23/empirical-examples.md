Back in July 2000,
I sent [these](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2000-July/006098.html)
[messages](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2000-July/006427.html)
to the Python developers' mailing list.
List comprehensions were still a new feature,
and I thought the best way to decide on a syntax was to try it out.
The idea didn't catch on,
but I still believe very strongly that
we ought to field-test language features and additions to libraries
*before* rolling them out,
and that such tests are much easier to do than most people believe.

**[July 11, 2000](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2000-July/006098.html)**

I sent the message below to the 11 developers here in the office this
morning.  They all have 10+ years experience with C, and 2-3 years with
C++, Java, or both.  None have used Python (I'm working on it :-), but two
have extensive Perl experience, and one worked on and with functional
languages in grad school.  The question was:

OK, folks, language question.  Given the statement:

    for x in [10, 20, 30]; y in [1, 2]:
        print x+y

(note that the second list is shorter than the first),
would you expect to see:

(A) 'x' and 'y' move forward at the same rate:

    11
    22

(B) 'y' goes through the second list once for each value of 'x':

    11
    12
    21
    22
    31
    32

(C) an error message because the two lists are not the same length?

Votes to me, please.

Thanks,
Greg

*Everyone* voted (B).  As useful as this capability is, I therefore think
the proposed syntax is likely to mislead.

Hope it's helpful,
Greg

I gave 20+ grad students in computer engineering and computer science
(plus a couple of profs) the questionnaire below.
A summary of results is:

* Everyone understood the existing syntax (A).

* Most assumed that that the 'zip()' function version would yield
  cross-product iteration (B).  This surprised me a lot, particularly
  as I think we all agree that 'zip()' is the most suggestive possible
  name for this function.

* Versions (D), (F), and (H) show that semi-colon separated targets
  imply cross-product iteration, but 'and' and 'while' imply
  simultaneous iteration.

* Version (G) shows that using 'and' suggests that the sequences being
  iterated over must have the same length.

The questionnaire and a table of responses are included below (100 characters wide).

The single and double loop below print the output shown:

for x in [10, 20, 30]:          for x in [10, 20, 30]:
    print x                         for y in [1, 2, 3]:
                                        print x+y
10                              11
20                              12
30                              13
                                21
                                22
                                23
                                31

                                33

Match each of the following to its output.
(Note that several examples may print the same thing.)
