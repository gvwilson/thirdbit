title: "You Should Talk to HR"
---

I was recently reminded that a lot of people in tech think HR's only responsibilities are hiring, benefits, and firing.
That's not how it's supposed to work:
in a well-run organization,
HR's real job is to help people plan career progression.
What do you want to be doing next year?
What about five years from now?
How are you going to get there,
and how are you doing?
Good HR professionals love to talk about this stuff,
so please,
take some time in the next few weeks to book an appointment and sit down with them and have a heart-to-heart.

*This has been a public service message
from someone who was lucky enough to get this kind of help exactly when he needed it,
and wishes more people would too.*
