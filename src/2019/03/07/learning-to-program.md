title: "Learning to Program"
---

A colleague recently pointed me at
[The Immutable Laws of Brainjo](https://clawhammerbanjo.net/the-immutable-laws-of-brainjo-the-art-and-science-of-effective-practice/),
which explains how to master a musical instrument more efficiently
based on the neuroscience of learning.
As I was working my through it,
I realized that while I know a fair bit about
[how to teach programming](http://teachtogether.tech),
I know far less about how to *learn* to program.
A quick flip through recent conference proceedings confirmed that
most research is done from the instructor's point of view;
there's very little about the equivalent of effective practice strategies.
I know about [The Learning Scientists](http://www.learningscientists.org/)
(whose book and six-part handouts I highly recommend),
but that's not programming-specific.
If anyone knows of research on what learners can do
to improve their programming skills more quickly and more reliably,
or better yet to programming-specific summaries of such research,
I'd be grateful for pointers:
you can leave comments on this post
