title: "Patterns in Git"
---

Two years ago,
[I proposed](@root/2017/09/30/git-graphs-and-engineering/) that someone could try to fix Git's usability issues by:

1. Downloading data from several thousand large projects on GitHub.

2. Using statistical techniques to identify patterns in those repositories' branch-and-merge graphs.

3. Selecting a small set of common subgraphs that account for a large fraction of everyday use.

4. Building an 80/20 tool that provides those, *and only those*.

Juno Chen, Ian Flores, Rayce Rossum, Richie Zitomer have now done this
as their major project in UBC's excellent [Master of Data Science](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/) program,
and you can find their work [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/RStudio-GitHub-Analysis/).
The short version is that *there are no patterns*—at least,
none that show up in repository history.
The first clustering was promising:

However,
the closer the team looked, the less signal they found.
Most GitHub repositories are initialized, have a handful of commits from one person, and are then abandoned;
once you filter those out,
most of the remainder are a single linear chain of commits (essentially, one person using Git for file backup).
Take that away and you're left with this:

There are many possible explanations for these results:
`git merge` might attenuate or erase the signal we're looking for,
the fraction of "interesting" repositories on Git might be vanishingly small,
or people might only *think* they're following [particular workflows](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
The only way to find out will be to observe developers and/or capture and analyze client-side data.

This wasn't the result I was hoping for,
but it's clear now that my hopes were naïve.
On the upside,
it was a genuine pleasure to work with Richie, Rayce, Ian, and Juno,
and I would recommend them and the [UBC MDS program](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/) wholeheartedly.
