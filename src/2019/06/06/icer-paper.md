title: "ICER Acceptance"

Paul Denny, Brett Becker, Michelle Craig, Piotr Banaszkiewicz, and I
were very pleased to receive notice last week
that [ICER 2019](https://icer.acm.org/)
has accepted our paper exploring
the questions people would most like computing education researchers to answer.
To recap:

1.  We asked one group of people what questions they would most like answered, then
2.  grouped and collated those questions, and
3.  asked a larger group of people how important or unimportant they thought those questions were.

We also asked respondents about their backgrounds and whether they teach and/or do research.
The most surprising finding was how little overlap there was between
the interests of people who do research and the interests of people who don't:

(The imbalance in numbers is an artefact of how we did the analysis.)
We will post a preprint as soon as we've addressed the reviewers' comments;
if you are coming to Toronto for the conference,
please give me a shoutâ€”I'd be happy to show you around my adopted home town.
