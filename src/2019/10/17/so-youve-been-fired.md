1.  Insist on a record of all conversations.
    The biggest mistake you can make is to assume good faith on the part of those who fired you.

2.  Take notes of _everything_ and make sure they're timestamped.

3.  Pause before speaking, posting, or tweeting.

4.  Keep your public statements brief:
    people may care, but most won't care as much as you do.

5.  If you want to correct something online, add a timestamped amendment:
    do not just take it down or edit it.

6.  Speak directly to _all_ the issues rather than omitting or ignoring things you'd rather not discuss.
    (It's hypocritical to criticize your opponents for spinning things or leaving things out if you're doing it too.)

7.  Don't sign any agreement that might prevent you from speaking about moral or legal concerns.
    -   Unless you feel your immigration status or essential health benefits are threatened,
        in which case make sure the agreement explicitly covers your concerns before signing it.

8.  Don't cite the law until your lawyer tells you to.

9.  Go for long walks, cook some healthy meals, pick up the guitar you haven't touched in years:
    do anything so long as it gets you off the screen for a while.

10. Remember: if this is the worst thing that ever happens to you,
    you had a pretty good life.
