[Maya Gans][gans] and I are pleased to announce that TidyBlocks has adopted the [Hippocratic License][hl],
a new open source license that allows people to use software freely with one condition:

> The Software may not be used by individuals, corporations, governments, or other groups
> for systems or activities that actively and knowingly endanger, harm, or otherwise threaten

We are grateful for [Coraline Ada Ehmke][cae] and others for creating this license.
