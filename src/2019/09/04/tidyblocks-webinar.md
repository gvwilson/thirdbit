If you've ever played with Scratch or another blocks-based programming tool and said,
"Gee, I wish I could use something like this to wrangle data,"
you're in luck:
TidyBlocks uses the same JavaScript framework as Scratch
to provide blocks that select, filter, group, and plot data.
It's aimed at high school students making their first foray into statistics or data analysis,
and it's 100% open sourceâ€”if you're interested using it,
or in honing your JS skills and helping us make it better,
come join us at <https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tidyblocks-discussion-tickets-71447115245> on Sept 17 for a discussion,
or check out our GitHub repo at <https://github.com/tidyblocks/tidyblocks>.

And if you want to hire the person who built it,
<https://maya.rbind.io/> is currently on the job market
and you will be very grateful you added her to your team.
