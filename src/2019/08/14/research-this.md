I presented "Research This! Questions that Computing Educators Most Want Computing Education Researchers to Answer"
at [ICER 2019](https://icer.acm.org/) this morning,
and the full paper is available [on this site](@root/files/bib/Denny2019.pdf)
and [through the ACM](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3339402).
It was a pleasure to work with Paul, Brett, Michelle, and Piotr,
and I hope people will find our results useful.

Based on feedback at the conference,
there are three things that could be tackled in a second iteration:

1. Competitive ranking of questions (or a fixed point budget, or some other mechanism)
   to get a more even distribution of unimportant-to-important.

2. Including more people who are involved in free-range teaching.

3. Including learners as question proposers and as rankers.

I think the last of these is the most important.
"Nothing for us, without us" has been a rallying cry in many disability communities for years,
and while I don't think it makes sense to ask elementary school children what they think researchers ought to investigate,
I think we can and should ask teenagers and adults.
