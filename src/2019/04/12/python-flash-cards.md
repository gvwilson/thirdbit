title: "Python Flash Cards"

I've never met [Eric Matthes](https://ehmatthes.github.io/),
but after spending an hour browsing his [Python Flash Cards](https://nostarch.com/pythonflashcards),
I would like to shake his hand.
They're well written,
beautifully organized,
and packed full of useful information and short examples.
I wish there were diagrams to go with the explanations,
but even without them,
this is a solid teaching resource.
