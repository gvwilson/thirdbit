<p>There are two kinds of people in the open source world: those who are in it to help others, and those who are in for the shouting.  Tong Shen and I ran into one of the former this week: his name is Brad Anderson, and he just put together a patch to make <a href="http://projects.edgewall.com/trac">Trac</a> work with <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>.  Tong had been having problems getting <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>, PostgreSQL, and <a href="http://pypgsql.sourceforge.net/">PyPgSQL</a> working on <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>.  He sent a message to Brad, who responded almost immediately with some helpful advice, and later walked through the same setup procedure Tong was using to make sure it was OK.</p>

<p>So thanks, Brad—and thanks to everyone else who has answered questions and contributed time over the past three years to help us out when we got stuck.  Hope we can pay it forward some time…</p>
