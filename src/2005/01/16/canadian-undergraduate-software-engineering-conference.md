I spent Saturday at <a href="http://2005.cusec.ca">CUSEC 2005</a>, where I met some interesting people, gave a couple of talks [1, 2], and marveled once again at how well <a href="http://www.carleton.ca">Carleton University</a> has managed to reproduce the neo-brutalist architecture I remember from my 1988 trip to Moscow.

It was an interesting conference: created and run by students, with an interesting mix of presentations from profs, grads, and undergrads. The only disappointment was discovering that there wasn't a single student attending from <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca">U of T</a>.  <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca">UNB</a>, several Montreal-area universities, both of Ottawa's, <a href="http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca">Waterloo</a>, and <a href="http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/cas/">McMaster</a> were well represented, but not Toronto.  Maybe Ottawa is just too cold for decadent southern Ontarians… ;-)

So, a big thank-you to Chris Donaldson, Mike Smith, and the rest of the organizers for inviting me up, and for a job well done—I hope to see you next year.
