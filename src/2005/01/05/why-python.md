title: "Why Python?"

<p>A couple of students have ask why we're using <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> instead of <a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl</a> in this term's projects.  After all, <a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl</a> is more popularâ€”there are more books about it, and a lot more libraries for it as well.</p>

<p>The answer is that Brent Gorda and I used <a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl</a> to teach classes at <a href="http://www.lanl.gov">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a> for two years.  When we switched to <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>, we found that it only took two days to cover material that had previously taken three.  What's more, students retained more: they were more likely to remember what they'd learned after the class was over, and (crucially) more likely to keep using <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to know why students got further with <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> than with <a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl</a>, check out the <a href="http://www.ozonehouse.com/mark/blog/code/PeriodicTable.html">Periodic Table of Perl Operators</a>.  Yes, that's right: <a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl</a> has so many built-in operators that you need a wall chart to keep track of them.  And that's even before you start counting all the different ways there are to pass parameters, index structures, and so on.</p>

<p>So if <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> is easier to learn, why is <a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl</a> more popular?  I blame history: <a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl</a> was in place and "good enough" when web programming took off in the mid-90s, while <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> was still in its infancy.  As Stephen Jay Gould observed in his book Wonderful Life, random chance plays a larger part in evolution and history than we're comfortable acknowledging.  Sometimes, there <em>is</em> no good reason; sometimes, things just are.</p>
