executive branch will follow the law.

<p>Canadians are a month away from choosing a new government.  Most
don't care; most think, "It couldn't happen here," or, "There's

<blockquote>
<p>In Germany they first came for the Communists, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Communist.</p>
<p>Then they came for the Jews, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew.</p>
<p>Then they came for the trade unionists, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a trade unionist.</p>
<p>Then they came for the Catholics, and I didn't speak up because I was a Protestant.</p>
<p>Then they came for me—and by that time no one was left to speak up.</p>
