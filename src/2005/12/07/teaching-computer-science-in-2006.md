I have accepted a half-time teaching position in the <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca">Dept. of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a> for 2006.  As well as teaching some regular courses, I plan to supervise some undergraduate programming projects<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> and work on DrProject and Software Carpentry.

[<a name="1"></a>1] Which means that I'm looking for CS undergrads with at least two 300-level courses and a 3.0 GPA who'd like to build software for real users.  If you're interested, please mail me.
