<p>Grain of salt and all, but <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/12/ruby_book_sales_surpass_python.html">this</a> is an interesting trend indicator.  What really made me gnash my teeth was the discovery that some Pythoneers are responding by building <a href="http://pylons.groovie.org/project">still</a> <a href="http://webpy.org">more</a> web frameworks for Python, instead of throwing their weight behindâ€”well, OK, it's not clear what they would throw their weight behind.  Software Carpentry: The Ruby Remix, anyone?</p>
