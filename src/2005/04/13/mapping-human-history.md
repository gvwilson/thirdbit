<p>Carl Zimmer's excellent blog <a href="http://www.corante.com/loom/">The Loom</a> has a report about Spencer Wells' project to map historical human migrations using genetic sampling.  (It also has a link to <a href="http://www5.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/atlas.html">this interactive map</a> of our species' history.)  Zimmer says, "You can buy a DNA kit, and hen you send it back to the Genographic Project, you'll get a report on 'your genetic journey' and the information will get added to Wells's database."  Gotta love thatâ€”"you can buy a DNA kit" has apparently moved from being science fiction to being as unremarkable as picking up a liter of milk.  Wonder what would happen if we organized students at <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca">the University of Toronto</a> to take part?</p>
