title: "Pythoneers at SIGSCSE"

Several colleagues of mine at the <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a> were at <a href="http://www.ithaca.edu/sigcse2005/">SIGCSE 2005</a> a couple of weeks ago.  They came back with lots to report; most interesting for me was the feeling that there's growing interest in Python as a teaching language.  One of them said that she could easily see Python becoming a major CS1 language over the next five years, and that if she had the time, she'd try to lead the wave by writing an introduction to computer science in Python.  I only know of <a href="http://www.fbeedle.com/99-6.html">one book</a> of this kind, which didn't particularly impress me.  I think that if Pythoneers are really serious about increasing their user base, they should start work now to organize a bunch of tutorials and meet-and-greets at <a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/~sigcse06/">next year's SIGCSE</a> in Houston.
