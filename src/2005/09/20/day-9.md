Week two of Software Carpentry, and things are starting to settle down.  There are now 93 (!) people signed up for the course:

This week's lecture went much more smoothly than last week's, in
part because we were in a larger room, with seating for everyone, and
in part because the content was an introduction to Python, which I've
given more times than I can count.  There were still some glitches in
the slides, though: a few things were out of order, and I really do
need to choose more concrete examples.  33 students have completed the
first exercise, which is already more than I'd expected—I'm feeling
uncharacteristically optimistic right now ;-)

The past week has also <a href="https://wwwcgi.cdf.utoronto.ca/~cs494hf/cgi-bin/argon.cgi">CSC49X</a>, the fourth-year Computer Science project course.  23 students are working on 10 different projects (24 and 11 respectively, if you count
Sean Dawson's paid-but-not-for-course-credit work on a sequence diagram debugger plugin for <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a>).  DrProject (our <a href="http://projects.edgewall.com/trac">Trac</a>-derived project management system) is holding up so far, and we're almost finished setting it up for two other courses to use this term as well.  Not bad for Day 9 of term; not bad at all.
