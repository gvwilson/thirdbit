<a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~pgries/">Paul Gries</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~arnold/">Arnold Rosenbloom</a>, and I spoke to the Toronto Java Users' Group meeting this past Tuesday about Java as a teaching language.  It was fun, and the questions and comments from the audience gave me lots to think aboutâ€”as did the fact that of the 45 people there, only one was female.  That, and <a href="http://www.misbehaving.net/2005/11/i_have_no_words.html">this</a>, and hearing about schools with a 60:1 male/female ratio, makes me feel weary.  (For the record, the ratio in my project course stands at 3:1.)
