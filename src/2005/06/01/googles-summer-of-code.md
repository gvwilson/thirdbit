A few years ago, I organized a project called Software Carpentry.  Its aim was to build a new generation of easy-to-use open source software engineering tools.  For a variety of reasons, it completely failed to meet its objectives (although it did give a boost to <a href="http://www.scons.org">SCons</a> and <a href="http://roundup.sourceforge.net">Roundup</a>).

Today, almost five years later, <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> is doing what I should have done with the US Department of Energy's money.  Their <a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Summer of Code</a> project is going to award $5000 to each of 200 open source student projects running this summer.  According to the project FAQ, the main goal is to identify and encourage young talent.  I think it's a great idea, and I wish it every success.
