All very tentative, but here are some of the options:
<ul>
  <li><strike>Add more features to RedInk, the online marking and code review system we've built over the past twelve months.</strike> <em>(Now full)</em></li>
  <li>Building a plugin for <a href="http://www.blackboard.com">Blackboard</a> to calculate and display statistics on the grades being given out by TAs in large courses (Java programming, lots of integration, customer is profs at U of T).</li>
  <li>Building a map-based visualization of data about theatre performers and playwrights in Shakespearean England for the Drama Dept. and the library (DreamWeaver, web programming, GIS).</li>
  <li>Adding new features to DrProject (Python web programming).  There are lots of possibilities here, ranging from user-centered views to a progress dashboard to continuous integration tools and real-time documentation generation.</li>
  <li>Extending Languify, an open source web-based tool for managing translation and internationalization (<a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby On Rails</a>, web programming). The customer here is a local software startup called <a href="http://www.savvica.com">Savvica</a>; a student has built a first version this summer, and there's a lot of interest.</li>
  <li>Help the folks at <a href="http://www.caisi.ca">CAISI</a> integrate hospital information systems to help the homeless.  This one would mostly be Java; it's a very good cause.</li>
  <li>Work with <a href="http://www.digitalketchup.com">Digital Ketchup</a> to build a REST web services interface to a tool that combines data from email and customer relationship management software.</li>
  <li>Add some features to <a href="http://queens.db.toronto.edu/project/blogs">BlogScope</a> to integrate with other data sources, and do some of the AI and pattern matching more efficiently.</li>
  <li>Sort out the mess that is date/time representation in Python's database interface libraries.</li>
</ul>
If you're at <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca">U of T</a>, have at least two 300-level courses in CS, and a good GPA (3.0 or higher), I'd like to hear from youâ€¦
