The July'06 issue of <a href="http://www.computer.org/portal/site/software/"><em>IEEE Software</em></a> has an excellent article called "Agile Software Testing in a Large-Scale Project".  It presents data on what happens when you introduce some XP practices into a large software project; as the authors say, "…this is the most comprehensive data set from an actual project using agile quality practices that has published its results to date."  Very worth reading—it's unfortunately not free, but you can <a href="http://csdl2.computer.org/persagen/DLAbsToc.jsp?resourcePath=/dl/mags/so/&toc=comp/mags/so/2006/04/s4toc.xml">buy a copy</a> online.  I've been sceptical of the claims made by XP's more outspoken advocates; it looks like I may have to admit I was wrong.
