I don't usually discuss legislative issues in this blog, but I can't let the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/07/27/us-house-resolution-targeting-myspace-web20-passes-410-15/">US House of Representatives' decision to block social networking sites and chat rooms</a> pass by without comment.  It's not just the decision itself that frightens me; it's the fact that it passed 410 to 15.  If only 3.5% of people understand the stupidity of such legislation, <em>and</em> have the backbone to say so out loud, we're in big troubleâ€¦
