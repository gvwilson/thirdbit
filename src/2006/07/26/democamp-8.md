They do seem to be coming thick and fast, don't they?  Last night's DemoCamp was held at No Regrets once again; turnout was down a little from the previous one, but I blame that on it being cottage season.  Presentations were:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://wildapricot.com/">WildApricot</a>: a web-based tool to help small organizations (think a local soccer league) handle memberships, registrations, fees, and events.  The presentation came complete with apricots ;-)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.jobloft.com">JobLoft</a>: the hands-down hit of the evening, this started last September (!) as a student project at <a href="http://www.ryerson.ca">Ryerson</a>, and is now a four-person company with real customers.  It's a job-finding service aimed at young people looking for work in the fast food and retail industries.  The site is <em>very</em> slick, and they've done an excellent job of integrating geographical information, RSS feeds, and all the other useful bits of Web 2.0.  I think the crowd was blown away by how professional it looked, especially considering how quickly it was put together, and how young its authors are.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.filemobile.com/">Filemobile</a>: helps bloggers manage pictures, video, etc.  The presenter didn't seem very excited about his own stuff.</li>
  <li><a href="http://languify.com/">Languify</a>: a collaboration between John Greene (<a href="http://www.nuvvo.com">Nuvvo</a>) and Nicolaas Handojo, an undergrad student at <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca">U of T</a>, who did the work as a 49X project.  Languify is a web-based system for managing the translation files used to internationalize and localize applications.  <a href="http://www.nuvvo.com">Nuvvo</a> is putting is up as a service to the community, in the hopes that volunteers will use it to provide translations for various pieces of open source software.  This presentation was part of Nicolaas's coursework; he passed ;-)</li>
  <li>Mike McDerment of <a href="http://www.freshbooks.com">FreshBooks.com</a> closed the evening with a never-quite-coherent lecture (with slides—sssss…) about the importance of funnels.  Or something. I was hoping he'd show us how to implement some of the ideas from Peterson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596009887"><em>Web Site Measurement Hacks</em></a>, but he didn't.</li>
</ul>
The coolest thing for me all evening was the fact that DemoCamp9 is already full, are are four of the five slots for September's DemoCamp10, and <a href="http://davidcrow.ca/">David Crow</a> didn't know.  That's as good a definition of success as I can think of…
