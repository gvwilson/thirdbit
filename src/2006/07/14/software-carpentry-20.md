I am pleased to announce the release of Software Carpentry 2.0 (Final).  The web site is up, the mailing lists have been populated, all the tickets have been moved into the project's Trac, and I've submitted a proposal for a wrap-up talk to SciPy'06. It's taken 18 months to complete instead of the 10 I originally planned, but I have a green light to teach the course again this winter at the <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a>, and hope that others will pick the course up elsewhere.
