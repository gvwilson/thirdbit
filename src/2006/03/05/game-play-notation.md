<p>I just discovered the <a href="http://www.lostgarden.com">Lost Garden</a> site, via <a href="http://lostgarden.com/2006/01/creating-system-of-game-play-notation.html">this article</a> on a notation for describing game play.  Worth adding to your blog roll; worth asking if there's a similar notation waiting to be invented to describe user interactions with standard desktop GUIs.</p>
