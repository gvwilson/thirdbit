<p>Never mind telecoms, internet, and television; the real convergence story is the way that real and fictional worlds are becoming ever more closely intertwined: you will soon be able to <a href="http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2006/03/the_future_of_credit_cards_ear.html">earn points toward World of Warcraft gold on your credit card</a>, and Creative Home Engineering will build a <a href="http://www.hiddenpassageway.com/">secret passage</a> in your home today.  (Both links courtesty of <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/">Bruce Schneier</a>'s blog.)</p>

<p>Update: Sean Dawson tells me that the cute little gnome on the credit card is Joi Ito, who is the leader of Sean's guild.  Smaaaaaall world.</p>
