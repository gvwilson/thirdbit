Week 11, and most of the projects for next term have been lined up.  Here's the current road map:
<ul>
  <li>The Online Marking tool, which gives TAs the ability to mark up student code on the web. This is now being used in a couple of courses, and there was lots of interest at DemoCamp in modifying it to work as a general online code review tool. Lillian Angel, Martin Williams, and Jane Shen will be working under the direction of <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~campbell">Jennifer Campbell</a>.</li>
  <li>We're also visualizing generalogical data for <a href="http://www.reed.utoronto.ca/index.html">REED</a>, the Records of Early English Drama project, using Flash, asynchronous XML, and other sexy technologies.  Apple Viriyakattiyaporn, Melissa Luu, and Lisa Ly will be doing the work.</li>
  <li>Prof. <a href="http://medbio.utoronto.ca/faculty/strother.html">Stephen Strother</a>'s team at the Rotman-Baycrest is studying the effects of strokes and other impairments on elderly patients; they have lots of data, and need a Java GUI for looking at it.  David Wright and Richard Zhou will be building one for him.</li>
  <li>Andrey Petrov and Maria Khomenko will be fixing up some file locking issues in <a href="http://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a>. I'm pretty excited about this one, as it'll be only the second time a 49X team has been contributing directly to a major open source project.</li>
  <li>David Chen, Winson Chung, and Mikhail Temkine are going to help <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~pgries">Paul Gries</a> get <a href="http://vpython.org/">VPython</a> and a graphics package into shape for use in the new CSC120 course.</li>
  <li>Debbie Winter and Rick Valenzano are going to study game theory and evolution under the direction of <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~gfb/">Gary Baumgartner</a>.</li>
  <li>Muhammad Ali will build the information visualization half of a status dashboard for DrProject.</li>
</ul>
15 students, 7 projects (8 if you count Igor Foox's field trials of UTest, and 9 if you count ongoing enhancements of DrProject).  I'm looking forward to itâ€¦
