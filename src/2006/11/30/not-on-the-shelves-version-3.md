Every couple of years, I indulge in a bit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_magic">sympathetic magic</a> by putting together a list of books I want someone to write, so that I can review them.  If nothing else, doing this helps me figure out what I currently think is and isn't important in our profession.  Previous versions were written in 1997 and 2003; the latest revision lists 16 books that would sell well whlie making the world a better place.
