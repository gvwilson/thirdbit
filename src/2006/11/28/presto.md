<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com">TechCrunch</a> recently profiled <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/11/27/presto-because-computers-scare-old-people/">Presto</a>, which allows people who don't have Internet access to receive photos and email.  (Special printer plugs into phone line; people with 'net access email yourname@presto.com; printer prints.)  It reinforces a theme I've been hitting in class with increasing regularity: the fastest-growing market in the industrialized world is old people, so if you're looking for a startup idea, try to think of something a 65-year-old would give you money for.

<hr />Later: Jon Udell posted some <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/11/28.html">interesting discussion</a> of using modern technology to make the <em>whole</em> cost of things visible to consumers.  I think this is another area with huge potential for growthâ€¦
