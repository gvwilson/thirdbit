The November 2006 issue of <a href="http://cise.aip.org/"><em>Computing in Science and Engineering</em></a> includes an article I wrote titled "Software Carpentry: Getting Scientists to Write Better Code by making Them More Productive".  It's available to subscribers only on the magazine's web site, but they have kindly given me permission to post it here. I think it's out too late to bring November's stats up above October's, but I could be surprised.
