CAS is IBM's Centre for Advanced Studies; <a href="https://www-927.ibm.com/ibm/cas/cascon_main/index.shtml">CASCON</a> is an annual gathering of Canadian computer scientists and others that it organizes.  Attendance is free, and there are some very interesting workshops this year.  Here are a few highlights:
<a href="https://www-927.ibm.com/ibm/cas/cascon/workshops/mon.shtml">Monday Oct 16</a>
<ul>
  <li>Agile for All: Supporting the Human Element in Agile Development</li>
  <li>AJAX (morning: intro; afternoon: the DOJO toolkit)</li>
</ul>
<a href="https://www-927.ibm.com/ibm/cas/cascon/workshops/tue.shtml">Tuesday Oct 17</a>
<ul>
  <li>Writing for the Web</li>

<ul>

  <li>Sense and Response Applications</li>

<ul>
  <li>Third International Symposium on Software Engineering Course Projects</li>

</ul>
The last two are the ones I most want to attend; it's a shame they're scheduled opposite one another.

Hope to see you there!
