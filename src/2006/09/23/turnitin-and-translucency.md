The ever-intriguing Jon Udell has just posted an <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/09/23.html#a1529">explanation</a> of how the use of a cryptographic database technique called translucency could address concerns about personal privacy.  I reviewed Wayner's <a href="http://www.wayner.org/books/td/">book</a> on translucent databases for <a href="http://www.ddj.com"><em>Doctor Dobb's Journal</em></a> back in 2003; as Udell says, the techniques are "â€¦as yet poorly understood and rarely applied, [but] the principle of translucent data management can help us defuse the ticking time bombs that many Internet services are becoming."
