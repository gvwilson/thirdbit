<p>Bruce Schneier is running a <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/04/announcing_movi.html">movie-plot thread contest</a>.  No, this is not a late April Fool's Day joke; yes, you should enter.  Possibilities that have <a href="http://cockeyed.com/citizen/terror/plans/terrorwatch.html">already been covered</a> include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Terrorists might mix superglue with women's makeup</li>
<li>Terrorists might do a suicide bomber on stage for American Idol finale</li>
<li>Terrorists might promote catfights</li>
<li>Terrorists might do simultaneous 'wardrobe failures'</li>
<li>Terrorists might equip rabbits with explosive-laden backpacks, with detonators attached to their heart-rate monitors</li>
</ul>

<p>(If you're wondering what to get me for Christmas, the last one sounds coolâ€¦)</p>
