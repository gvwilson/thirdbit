<p><a href="http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000382.html">This post</a>, titled "Why Ruby On Rails Won't Become Mainstream", has kicked off a lot of discussion (see, for example, <a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/2006/04/11#1500">Ted Leung's response</a>).    The whole conversation is both entertaining and thought-provoking, but I was amused by point #5: "Ruby on Rails has pretty much nuked the field of Web development in Ruby, and I wonder if it's such a good thing."  After complaining for the last year and a half about Python having so many web programming frameworks that none of them can attain critical mass, it's rather ironic to have someone griping about the opposite… ;-)</p>
