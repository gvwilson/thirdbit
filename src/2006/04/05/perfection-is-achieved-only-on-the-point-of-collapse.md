<p><a href="http://www.artima.com/forums/flat.jsp?forum=106&amp;thread=155123">This posting</a>, from Guido van Rossum, is a great example of language design in action: person A proposes feature X, person B says, "No, we can do that with Y, and a whole lot more besides," and eventually a lightbult comes on.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it's also an example of Parkinson's Other Law (quoted in the title of this post).  Neither adapters and generic functions will win Python thousands of new users, or ensure its longevity; coming up with a credible web application framework to compete with <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby On Rails</a> might.  At this point, I'd even be willing to settle for language design discussions that are driven by the needs of persistence frameworks, asynchronous computation, and testingâ€¦</p>
