<p>Leah Bobet (a Toronto-area writer) has posted a lengthy summary of the <a href="http://cristalia.livejournal.com/96911.html">Mark Tushingham</a> case.  For non-Canadian readers, he's a scientist with Environment Canada who was ordered by our new Conservative government not to speak about the science behind his new science fiction novel.</p>

<p>Please, contact your <a href="http://webinfo.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/MainMPsCompleteList.aspx?TimePeriod=Current&amp;Language=E">MP</a> and gripe about this: we are only free to speak if we are <em>all</em> free to speak.</p>
