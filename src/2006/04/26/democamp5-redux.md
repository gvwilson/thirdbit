The <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a> hosted DemoCamp 5 last night.  It went well: 143 people showed up, the Bell Kids Help Phone team gave a fault-free presentation, and the folks at <a href="http://www.mollyblooms.ca">Molly Bloom's</a> took good care of us afterward (so good, in fact, that I'm going to let people who <em>don't</em> have hangovers cover the details).

The most interesting part of the evening for me, though, came when I asked how many people were using <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>, and almost half the hands in the audience went up.  Afterward, <a href="http://weblog.latte.ca/blake">Blake Winton</a> asked me why the university was using Python instead of Ruby for teaching.  Like me, he's a long-time Pythoneer; like me, he thinks that educators have a responsibility to prepare students for the real world.  I mumbled about Python not having dollar signs, about there being more books (although if even half the projects I know about come to fruition, that is going to change in the next 12-18 months), and about us already having developed lots of course material that we can't afford to rewrite.  It was a clear choice three years ago, but today?  I dunno, and the fact that I don't is why I'm still <a href="http://www.dehora.net/journal/2006/04/links_for_20060422.html">going on about this</a>.

But enough dark clouds: 143 people had a good time last night, lots of useful new connections were made, and Joey played his accordion. It's a good life.
