<p><a href="http://unleashedinformatics.com">Unleashed Informatics</a>, the spin-off successor to <a href="http://www.blueprint.org">Blueprint</a>, has <a href="http://unleashedinformatics.com/index.php?pg=news.announcements.060403">announced</a> that it is going to <a href="http://www.itbusiness.ca/it/client/en/home/News.asp?id=39023">enforce its patent</a> on a "system for electronically managing, finding, and/or displaying biomolecular interactions."  Three of my 49X projects were with Blueprint—we built testing infrastructure, a SOAP interface, and a graph search engine for their flagship biomolecular interaction database—and several worked for Blueprint at various times.  I'll be interested to see how broadly they try to apply their patent, and how much good it does them.</p>
