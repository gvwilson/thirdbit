<p>Two interesting business models for people who want to make money from open source software:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.coverity.com/">Coverity</a> is using its static analysis tools to look for defects in widely-used open source packages.  Their <a href="http://scan.coverity.com/">current report</a> makes for interesting reading; equally interesting is the way that some communities (such as <a href="http://www.amanda.org">AMANDA</a>) have responded—their defect density dropped dramatically after stats started appearing.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.spikesource.com/">SpikeSource</a> assembles (and sells) open source suites—Linux with Apache, PostgreSQL, Perl, etc.—that have actually been tested together, so that you can be confident they'll work.</li>
</ul>

<p>The common element here is quality: people will always pay for it, just as they will for medicine and chocolate.  Makes me wonder whether you could create a business selling insurance on software: "You give us $199/month, and if this crashes more than once per hundred thousand hours of operation, or if someone gets through the security, we'll pay you $10,000."  We have a lot of data on how flaky various platforms are, and we can guesstimate the cost of downtime.  If any grad students in economics are looking for thesis topics…</p>
