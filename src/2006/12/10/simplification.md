title: "Simplification"

We held a post mortem on this term's projects Friday before going out to dinner. I took away three major points:

-   We have to simplify the ticketing interface in DrProject, so that people will use it even in very small groups. One suggestion is to make it more like Basecamp's to-do list. However:
    -   We want to keep AJAX to a minimum (accessibility, stability, etc.).
    -   Some of the companies who are thinking about adopting DrProject (or who have done so already) want to *add* complexity; in particular, they want parent-child and precedes-follows relations on tickets, a "ready for test" state, and so on.
-   Students think that doing demos is a valuable experience, but it takes a lot of time. (Students get to do their demos twice: once for feedback, and one for a grade.) Swapping them around—i.e., having one day's students practice on their peers, then do their real demos for another day's students—is one possibility, but scheduling is going to be difficult. We've also tried having students do their final demos in tutorial sections of sophomore courses, to give second-year students a taste of what they could be doing by final year, but again, scheduling is hard.
-   I didn't track students' progress nearly as well as I should have. There's no amalgamated cross-project view in DrProject (yet—David Scannell has built it, but we haven't deployed it on the production server), and while cycling through seven projects to check event logs isn't *that* tedious, I somehow never quite got around to it. As a result, students didn't structure their work around making the event log look good, which led to a downward spiral.

If we upgrade DrProject over the break, #3 will (mostly) take care of itself. I'm open to suggestions for #2, but what I'd really like from readers is ideas for #1.  We do *not* want a "kitchen sink" interface that relies on configuration files to hide certain features in certain installations; I know from personal experience that these are a nightmare to test and maintain.

Ideas?
