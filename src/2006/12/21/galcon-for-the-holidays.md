The last thing I need in my life right now is an addictive computer game, so what have I found?  <a href="http://www.imitationpickles.org/galcon/index.html">Galcon</a>, that's what.  It's a five-minute real-time strategy game (think "Risk" on speed).  If y'all want to crush a prof, get back to me in the New Year—I oughta be at a non-totally-embarrassing level by then… ;-)

Happy Holidays!
