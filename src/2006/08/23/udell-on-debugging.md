Another good <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/08/23.html#a1512">article</a> from Jon Udell, this one on debugging.  As far as I can tell, the topic is wide open as a research area: if you want to do graduate work in systems, coming up with better ways to track down and repair problems would be a high-yield topic to focus on.
