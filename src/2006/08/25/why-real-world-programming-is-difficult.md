I just finished reorganizing my database of former project students, and now it looks like I have to re-jig the schema once again.  The reason is that South Indians use a Unix-like path for personal names: village/father's-name/name.  Thus, the "C." in "C. V. Raman" identifies a place, "V." identifies his father, and "Raman" is his personal name.

Eurocentric library indices aren't set up to handle this, which is why this particular physicist's work is filed under what he (and millions of others) would consider to be his "first" name.  Getting this kind of thing right is increasingly important in a flat world (as well as simply being polite).  So, anyone have a sample database schema out there that will handle non-Euro names properly that I can use as a model?
