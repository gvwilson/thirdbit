Amazon's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=201590011">EC2</a> (reviewed <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/08/24.html#a1513">here</a> by Jon Udell, and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/08/24/exclusive-amazon-readies-utility-computing-service/">here</a> by TechCrunch) brings it one step closer to reality. How long before someone starts referring to this as "Web 3.0"?
