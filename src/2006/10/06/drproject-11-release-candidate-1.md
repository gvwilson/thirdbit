I am very pleased to announce the first release candidate for DrProject 1.1.  We're very grateful for David Scannell[^1] for dozens of improvements and bug fixes.  DrProject is a fork of <a href="http://trac.edgewall.com">Trac</a> with:
<ul>
  <li>support for multiple projects in a single installation;</li>
  <li>integrated mailing lists;</li>
  <li>tagging and tag clouds;</li>
  <li>a web-based administrative interface; and</li>
  <li>a scripting API.</li>
</ul>
It is being used in several courses at the <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a>, and at <a href="http://www.queensu.ca">Queen's University</a>; we hope you'll give it a try.
