I gave away some of my childhood toys today.
I only vaguely remember playing with them,
but my mum hung onto to them for almost forty years.
We gave away some books, too,
and some of my daughter's old clothes.
I decided to keep my mum's cane, though,
and my dad's old Remington typewriter.
I know I'll have to give them away eventually,
because in the end we give it all away,
but I'm not ready to do that yet.
