The four skills I needed most when I was managing people have all turned out to be equally important in teaching:

1.  How to intervene when people behave badly.
    It doesn't come up often, but [knowing how makes you more likely to do it when you should](https://hbr.org/2020/05/why-sexual-harassment-programs-backfire).

2.  How to run a meeting.
    Agenda before, minutes after, manage speaking time—none of it is magic,
    but without it, everything else is harder than it needs to be.

3.  How to write a two-page memo making the case for doing something
    so that people have something concrete to debate
    (and so that there is a record later of *why* we did something).

4.  How to set priorities and re-set them when the world changes or people fall behind.
    (The real purpose of a schedule is to tell you when to start cutting things from your plan…)

If I was going to add a 5th, it would be "how to make things discoverable"
so that people can find what they need when they need it,
but I'm still trying to figure that one out…
