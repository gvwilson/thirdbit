My work log tells me I've spent 54 hours since mid-November
building [this discrete event simulation][sim],
which works out to a little over an hour a day.
I've learned a few things about [SimPy][simpy] and [Polars][polars] along the way,
and depending on what happens with my job search,
I may run an online workshop in 2026 to walk people through it.
For now,
though,
I need to put this aside and concentrate on completing a couple of small contracts
and revising some of the fiction [I finally "finished"][year].
