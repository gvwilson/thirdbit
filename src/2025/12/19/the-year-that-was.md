Another year, another "where did the time go?" post…

-   My daughter left home to start university.
    She had a wonderful first semester,
    but [I miss her in all sorts of ways][dishwasher].

-   I supervised [some student projects][student-projects] at the University of Toronto
    for the first time in fifteen years.
    I really enjoyed working with them,
    and I hope they had fun as well,
    but it brought me face-to-face with how bad the job market is right now
    for newcomers in tech.

-   I was [laid off][layoff] for the third time in eight years,
    which has brought me face-to-face with how bad the job market is right now
    for oldcomers in tech.

-   The refugee that my spouse and I helped sponsor through [Rainbow Railroad][rainbow]
    finally arrived in Canada,
    and has settled in well.

-   I ran [a workshop on organizational change][change] at
    the [European Molecular Biology Lab][embl] in Heidelberg
    and gave a talk on [cocaine and Conway's Law][cocaine] at
    [the University of Zurich][zurich]
    ([video here][cocaine-video]).

-   I contributed to a paper called "[10 Quick Tips for Making Your Software Outlive Your Job][quick-tips]",
    which was motivated in large part by the Trump administration's hack-and-slash attacks on science.

-   I started building [a tutorial][sim] on how to simulate software development processes.

-   I played jazz in public for the first time in twenty-three years.

-   One wedding, no funerals.

-   I finally finished (first complete drafts of) three pieces of fiction
    that I've been working on for longer than I want to admit.
    I don't know if there's a market for any of them right now,
    but it felt pretty good to finally write "The End".

Time for the day's last cup of tea.
If you came in peace, be welcome.
