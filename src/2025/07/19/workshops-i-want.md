title: Workshops I Want
date: 2025-07-19

Following up on [yesterday's post](@root/2025/07/18/no-satisfaction/),
here are some workshops I'd really like to take.
If you're offering any of them,
please let me know.

1.  **Experimental design and analysis for software engineers**
    who are trying to figure out how well their AI-based tools actually work.

1.  **An introduction to the social sciences for programmers**
    who want to understand how power actually works in our society.
    (See [*Sex and Drugs and Guns and Code*](@root/talks/sdgc/) for some thoughts.)

1.  **Distributed systems design by example**—basically,
    a sequel to [*Software Design by Example*](@root/sdxpy/)
    in which learners build working models of distributed systems
    in order to understand how the real things work.

1.  **Systems administration for data scientists**
    (or, what people who wrangle dataframes for a living need to know
    in order to deploy an application for others to use).
    This request is mostly professional curiosity:
    I've [tried and failed](https://gvwilson.github.io/sudonomicon/) to create this,
    and would like to see how others do it.

1.  **Managing research software projects**—not "how to use Git"
    but hiring and firing,
    marketing,
    budgeting,
    succession planning,
    and similar challenges.
    Again,
    I've also [tried and failed to create this](@root/mrsp/),
    so my interest here is partly professional curiosity.

1.  **Organizational change for research software engineers**.
    We spend a lot of our time rolling rocks up hills;
    as I approach the end of my career,
    I'd really like someone to teach me how to get rid of the damn hills.

*In a better world than this,
Canada would have a Natural Science and Engineering Education Council alongside NSERC
to fund the creation, dissemination, delivery, and evaluation of teaching and training materials.
Alas, that is not the timeline we're in…*
