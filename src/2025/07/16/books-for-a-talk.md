title: Books For a Talk

I'm finally turning [my proposal](@root/ideas/sdgc/) for a book titled
*Sex and Drugs and Guns and Code: What Everyone in Tech Needs to Know About Politics, Economics, Justice, and Power*
into a talk.
The sources I plan to mention are listed below;
I'd be grateful for pointers to ones I've missed.

> Note: my target audience is undergraduates in computer science and software engineering
> who have never taken a class on politics, sociology, anthropology, or organizational behavior,
> but dismiss those disciplines as "soft".
> If forced to wade through something dense and dull
> they will dutifully parrot what they think they're supposed to in order to get a grade,
> but not change their view of the world in any substantial way.
> In order to have impact,
> this book must be engaging;
> serious academics may therefore dismiss it as "light" or "shallow",
> but there's no point being right if no one hears you.

-   Examples of humanist analyses in software engineering:
    -   Petre: ["UML in Practice"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2486788.2486883) (2013)
    -   Steinmacher et al: ["Social Barriers Faced by Newcomers Placing Their First Contribution in Open Source Software Projects"](https://doi.org/10.1145/2675133.2675215) (2015)
    -   Sedano et al: ["Software Development Waste"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icse.2017.20) (2017)
    -   Hicks: ["It's Like Coding in the Dark"](https://www.catharsisinsight.com/reports) (2022)
    -   See [The Fourth Tradition](@root/2022/12/29/the-fourth-tradition/) for more background
-   What [software engineering management books](@root/2024/12/03/software-engineering-management-books/) *don't* talk about:
    -   Labor rights
    -   Workplace discrimination: less than 8 pages between 12 books
    -   Professional liability (or rather, why there isn't any)
    -   Regulatory capture
    -   Co-operatives and other organizational models
-   Books that are earnest but will put most programmers to sleep:
    -   Steen: *[Ethics for People Who Work in Tech](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780367542436)* (2022)
    -   Goltz & Dowdesell: *[Real World AI Ethics for Data Scientists](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781032275055)* (2023)
    -   Schlossberger: *[Ethical Engineering: A Practical Guide with Case Studies](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781032151120)* (2023)
    -   Wendorff: *[Politics in Software Development](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781484273791)*(2022)
-   Books that prove these topics can be interesting:
    -   Levitt & Dubner: <em><a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780061234002">Freakonomics</a></em> (2006)
        -   Preaches the neoliberal gospel that the only valid way to analyze individual behavior is maximization of wealth…
        -   …which is provably wrong, but their writing is so engaging that this is possibly the most effective piece of propaganda in English in the last 30 years
    -   Wainright: <em><a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781610397704">Narconomics: How to Run a Drug Cartel</a></em> (2017)
        -   Turns out that marketing and HR are big challenges for crime syndicates…
        -   …and you can learn a lot about how legitimate business works by looking at ones that ignore the legal system
        -   I'd like to see a book comparing big tech to drug cartels
            -   Big tech companies sell deliberately addictive products…
            -   …treat the law as a business expense…
            -   …and are frequently run by narcissists
    -   Raymond: <em><a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781565927247">The Cathedral and the Bazaar</a></em> (1999)
        -   Popularized a compelling but misleading myth about the social organization of open source development
        -   Part of the point of *this* book is to get readers to the point where they understand why it was wrong *and* why it was popular
    -   Bellotti: <em><a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781718501188">Kill It With Fire: Manage Aging Computer Systems (and Future Proof Modern Ones)</a></em> (2021)
        -   A critical but compassionate look at legacy systems, why they persist, and how to change them
-   Books that I think every software engineer should read (but know they won't, hence the needed to summarize):
    -   Douglas: <em><a href="https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780415289955">Purity and Danger: An Analysis of Concepts of Pollution and Taboo</a></em> (2002)

> **Abstract**
>
> Most young programmers have only ever been exposed to one worldview:
> the toxic strain of neoliberal capitalism favored by venture capitalists and their gushing fans in the tech media.
> As inequality widens and racist nationalism makes a comeback,
> as we do everything in our power to make climate change *worse*
> while companies like X, Facebook, and Shopify tie themselves in knots to avoid responsibility for their actions,
> most programmers don't have the intellectual tools to understand what's wrong and how we might fix it.
>
> Lots of books give cogent answers to these questions,
> but programmers who have never done a civics course
> are not going to read nine thousand pages on a whim.
> However,
> they *might* sit through a one-semester course that explains why the human side of software engineering
> is harder than the technical side.
> This talk outlines what such a course might cover:
> why "flat" organizations make power imbalances worse rather than better,
> why discrimination persists despite its economic inefficiency,
> how regulatory capture works,
> why Americans keep shooting one another,
> and what can we learn about big tech by studying drug cartels.
