I had the pleasure of working with two teams of undergraduates at the University of Toronto this semester.
They have now wrapped up their projects
and I think what they did was very cool.

[Amy Kim][kim-amy] and [Daelenia Susanto][susanto-daelenia] built a tool called [Browsercast][browsercast-repo]
that plays an HTML slideshow in sync with a voiceover.
They spent a lot of time wrestling with JavaScript APIs and browser idiosyncracies,
and a lot more thinking about who would use it and how;
their [demo video][browsercast-video] shows what it can do,
and we're grateful to [Tony Burbage][burbage-tony] for guidance.

[David Barsamyan][barsamyan-david],
[Lorena Buciu][buciu-lorena],
[Rachel Seong][seong-rachel],
[Evence Wang][wang-evence],
and [Cassandra Tin Kwon Yuen][yuen-cassandra]
built [a set of plugins][mossball-repo] for [Marimo][marimo]
that implement common types of classroom exercises
like find-the-word puzzles and multiple choice questions.
[Their video][mossball-video] shows each one in operation and explains their architecture;
we hope to have them available as a Python package just as soon as exams are over.

This marks the first time I've supervised senior computer science projects in 15 years.
I think I had at least as much fun as they did,
and very proud of what they accomplished.
If you're looking for talented junior programmers,
please reach out,
and if you'd like to contribute to the projects,
they'd be very happy to talk to you.
