Suppose you were going to build a one-day hands-on tutorial for software engineers
on what "productivity" means and how to observe it
(which might or might not include measuring it quantitatively).
You have 6x30 minutes to talk and 4x45 minutes for practical exercises.
(Yes, that only adds up to six hours, but you need to leave time for questions, coffee breaks, lunch, etc.)
If each of those six slots is built around one particular research paper,
what are the papers?
And what are the four exercises?

Please:

-   Peer-reviewed research papers please, not opinion pieces from industry pundits.
-   Papers, not books (but I'll accept chapters from books as "papers").
-   Tools and data used in the exercises has to be openly accessible.

If you have suggestions, please [email me][email], and thank you in advance.
If there are enough useful comments, I'll organize an online discussion of this.

> Why productivity?
> Because it affords a good mix of "how do we collect and analyze data?",
> "when are quantitative and qualitative analysis the right tools?",
> and "how do we operationalize a question like this?"
> It's also very topical—most discussions of the impact of AI are vacuous
> because we're arguing about performance improvements without first defining
> performance—and there's a lot of research out there to draw on.
> I also hope it will draw interest from both the research community
> and research-friendly practitioners.
