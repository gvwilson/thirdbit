Jen Heemstra's
[*Labwork to Leadership: A Concise Guide to Thriving in the Science Job You Werenâ€™t Trained For*](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780674258631)
is the book I've been hoping to find for years.
It includes sections on managing yourself, managing others, and coaching future leaders,
all grounded in first-hand experience and empirical research.
I wish it included more on [organizational change](https://gvwilson.github.io/change/)
and [winding projects down](@root/2025/09/12/searching-for-closure/),
but those are *my* preoccupations:
as is,
it would be a great foundation for a Carpentries-style workshop,
and I hope someone creates that.
