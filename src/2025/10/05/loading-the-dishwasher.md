title: Loading the Dishwasher

My daughter was profligate in her use of kitchenware:
she would always grab a fresh glass for water instead of re-using the one that she had just emptied,
and never used three saucepans to cook when she could use five.
Now that she has left home,
I only need to load the dishwasher once a day.

But I wish I still had to load it twice.

Time to make another cup of tea. If you came in peace, be welcome.
