title: If I Retired

If I retired tomorrow,
here's how I would spend each week:

-   Writing fiction.
    (I'm making slow but steady progress on a middle-grade book
    and have the last 30,000 words of a YA novel queued up behind it.)

-   Working on either the [second](@root/ideas/se-change/#setper)
    or [third](@root/ideas/se-change/#observe) proposal
    for a new kind of undergraduate software engineering course.

-   Teaching.
    I'm about to teach [a workshop on organizational change](https://gvwilson.github.io/change/),
    and helping with [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06484) has convinced me that
    one on how to end projects gracefully would be useful too.

-   Contributing to some open source project,
    because I enjoy programming the way some people enjoy knitting or jigsaw puzzles.

I'd find time in there for housework,
playing the sax,
and riding my bike or swimming (depending on the season and the state of my knees).

What I *really* want,
though,
is a circle of friends to do these things with.
I love my wife very much,
but we have our own interests:
I'm never going to enjoy gardening or cooking as much as she does,
boardgames like [Hive](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2655/hive)
or [Santorini](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/194655/santorini) aren't ever going to be her thing.
I always thought [my younger brother](@root/2018/03/20/goodbye-jeff/) and I
would wind up playing chess in the park in our twilight years;
here's hoping I find a few other people to do that with in his absence.
