title: If I Retired

If I retired tomorrow,
here's how I would would to spend each week:

-   Writing <a href="@root/fiction/">fiction</a>.
    I'm making slow but steady progress on a couple of middle-grade books
    and need another 30,000 words to finish off a YA novel I've been working on for several years.
    I started writing them for my daughter when she was young;
    she's now in university,
    and unlikely to find them as engaging as she once would have,
    but I'd still like to finish them.

-   Helping to assemble a new kind of undergraduate software engineering course
    in which learners explore what it means for programmers to be productive
    and how we can make it [observable](@root/ideas/se-change/#observe).
    I think this would be a good way to introduce young programmers to
    the difference between reliable research and plausible punditry,
    but I wouldn't want to tackle it on my own:
    I don't (yet) know enough about productivity and observability in software development,
    and too many of the projects that seemed like good ideas to me at the time
    have turned out to have [fatal flaws](@root/2021/07/22/whatever-happened-to-tidyblocks/).

-   Teaching.
    I'm about to teach [a workshop on organizational change](https://gvwilson.github.io/change/),
    and helping with [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06484) has convinced me that
    one on how to end projects gracefully would be useful too.
    Really,
    though,
    I just want to get back in the classroom:
    for better or worse,
    AI Is the biggest change in teaching and learning in my adult lifetime,
    and I want to be in the thick of it rather than opining from the sidelines.

-   Doing housework,
    playing the sax,
    and riding my bike or swimming (depending on the season and the state of my knees).

What I would want most,
though,
is a circle of friends to do these things with.
I love my wife very much,
but I'm never going to enjoy gardening or cooking as much as she does,
and boardgames like [Hive](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2655/hive)
and [Santorini](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/194655/santorini) aren't ever going to be her thing.
I always thought [my younger brother](@root/2018/03/20/goodbye-jeff/) and I
would wind up playing chess in the park in our twilight years;
as the nights grow longer and the leaves begin to turn,
I'd like to have other people to do that with.
