There's nothin' to know.
You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say.
Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong,
if you aren't positive yourself.
Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky wordsâ€¦although
I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all.
So I don't think it's too important.
Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out'
and that's the end, you're done.
