A solarium.
A table with two comfortable chairs, an old man in each.
Snow is falling outside.
There is a chessboard between the two men;
a game is in progress.
A clock is ticking.
The camera pans in and over the men
just as one of them sighs and reaches out to move a knight.

Vienna at night, 1955.
A younger version of the man who just moved slips over a wall
and enters a noisy bar through the back door.

The solarium; the clock is ticking.
The second man sips his coffee, then puts the cup down and moves his rook.

Inside the bar, people are dancing, laughing, and talking in German and English.
A younger version of the second man is sitting at a table with a pretty young woman.
He turns suddenly and stares directly into the camera.

Solarium.
The first man moves his knight again.

The bar, in slow motion.
The first man pulls a gun out from under his jacket.

Solarium.
The second man looks at the board,
scratching his head,
while the first man pours a fresh cup of coffee and stirs in some sugar.
Finally the second man sighs and moves a pawn to cover his rook.

The bar, still in slow motion.
The young woman rises from her chair, mouth open to shout or scream.
She pushes the second man aside as the first man fires.

Solarium.
The first man sits down his coffee and nonchalantly takes his opponent's pawn with his knight.
He smirks slightly at his opponent…who suddenly smiles back
and moves a bishop the full length of the board.

The bar.
The woman is falling, shot through the heart.
The second man is already turning, tucking the gun back under his jacket.
He doesn't see the bartender stepping into his path, a baseball bat in his hands.
