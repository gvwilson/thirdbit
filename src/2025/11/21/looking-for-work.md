I was laid off by Plotly a few weeks ago,
so I'm looking for something new.
I would prefer to work in education, developer experience, open source, or scientific computing,
and I'm open to part-time, full-time, or contracting positions,
either in Toronto or remote.
There's more about me at <https://third-bit.com/about/>;
if you'd like to chat,
please give me a shout.
