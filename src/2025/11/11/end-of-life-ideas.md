title: End of Life Ideas
date: 2025-11-11

Years ago, [Mike Hoye suggested][historical-reasons] that we should retire Unix usernames
in the way that sports teams retire jersey numbers,
and for the same reasons.
I was reminded of this while doing interviews with people about how projects end;
a couple of other ideas that have come up are adding a `-eol` (end-of-life) modified to semantic versioning
similar to the `-beta` modifier,
so that `1.2.3-eol` would mean "this is the last release this project is going to do",
and holding wakes for projects so that people can celebrate the contributions they *did* make
and the impact they *did* have.
If you have other suggestions or rituals,
please [get in touch](mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com).
