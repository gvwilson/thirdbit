Mike Conley has <a href="http://mikeconley.ca/blog/2010/08/11/some-preliminary-results/">posted some early results</a> from his study of student code reviews.  One of the most <a href="http://mikeconley.ca/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/quality_of_my_work.jpg">interesting</a> is that students who have reviewed their peers' code believe they know more about the quality of their own work. He should be finished his analysis in a few weeksâ€”I'm looking forward to hearing what else he's found.
