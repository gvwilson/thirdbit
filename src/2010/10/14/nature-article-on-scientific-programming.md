<p><a href="http://www.nature.com/"><em>Nature</em></a> has just published an article by Zeeya Merali titled "<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101013/full/467775a.html">Computational science: â€¦Error</a>" that looks at what's wrong with scientific computing today. Software Carpentry gets a mention, along with some of the scientists who are trying to raise awareness and standards. And in a <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101013/full/467753a.html">companion article</a>, Nick Barnes makes the case for scientists publishing their research software. Here's hoping both will be widely read.</p>
