The Great Beyond has a <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2010/10/canadian_scientists_fight_back.html">post</a> today about Canadian scientists creating a <a href="http://www.publicscience.ca/portal/page/portal/science">web site</a> to get their side of the story across in the face of repeated attempts by our government to muzzle them. It's good to see this starting up, but as GB notes, the site:
<blockquote>…hosts some (unfortunately rather dry) video testimonials by scientists  explaining the importance of their work—a worthy project, but sadly  one unlikely to ignite a public rally to support the cause…The 'Take action!'  section of the site is currently blank…</blockquote>
I wonder if they could use some help…
