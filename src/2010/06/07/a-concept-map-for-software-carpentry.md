One of the many things that impressed me about Michael Nygard's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Release-Production-Ready-Software-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/0978739213"><em>Release It!</em></a> and Robert Hanmer's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Fault-Tolerant-Software-Wiley/dp/0470319798"><em>Patterns for Fault Tolerant Software</em></a> was their use of concept diagrams to show how the ideas they were discussing fit together. Our second attempt to do this for the <a href="http://www.software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a> course is now online, and we'd welcome your input. Our goal is to encompass what we think is meant by "computational thinking"â€”please let us know what we've left out, what we've got wrong, and where the ideas in the blue box ought to go.
