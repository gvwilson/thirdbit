The <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a> student I'm working with, Chas Leichner, has <a href="http://cleichner.blogspot.com/2010/06/tour-of-testbed.html">a working prototype of a two-pane folding editor</a> for IDLE (the Tkinter-based IDE that ships with Python). This will let him edit control annotations for code side-by-side with the code itself, so that we can start experimenting with the kinds of control we ought to support. Neat!
