title: "Day 2: More Sticky Notes"

<p>Day 2. I feel I should say something like, "We traversed the lower ridge, and are camped in a small valley overlooked by the main peakâ€“I can hear wallabies hooting in the distance," but (a) it hasn't been quite that dramatic and (b) I don't think wallabies hoot. In <em>this</em> reality, Jason, Jon, and I spent another afternoon mapping content: in particular, disentangling the mouse-clicking and data-analyzing aspects of the spreadsheet lecture. Tomorrow we hope to do our first pair of five-minute trial screencasts, just to see how well (or how poorly) our chosen tools work.</p>
