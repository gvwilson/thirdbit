title: "A Few Things You May Not Have Known About Andrew Wakefield"

<a href="http://tallguywrites.livejournal.com/148012.html">This post</a> from Darryl Cunningham is a damning summary of the harm done by Andrew Wakefield, who was paid to "prove" that vaccines cause autism. Children have died, and will continue to die, because of what he did; if a big pharma company had acted exactly the same way, there would have been street protests outside its headquarters and a massive class action lawsuit… As Cunningham says, though, the real villain here is the popular press, which will run any scare story that comes their way on page 1, and the correction on page 100 (if at all). It makes me angry and weary at the same time…
