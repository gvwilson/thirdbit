Michael Feathers (author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052/"><em>Working Effectively with Legacy Code</em></a>) has posted a 5-star review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596808321"><em>Making Software</em></a> at Amazon.com.  He says:
<blockquote>I'm going to go on record and say that this is one of the most important  books about software development that has been published in the last  few years.  It's easy for many of us in the industry to complain that  software engineering research is years behind practice and that it is  hard to construct experiments or perform studies which produce  information that is relevant for practitioners, but fact is, there are  many things we can learn from published studies.
The editors of this book do a great job of explaining what we can  and can not expect from research.  They also adopt a very pragmatic  mindset, taking the point of view that appropriate practice is highly  contextual.  Research can provide us with evidence, but not necessarily  conclusions.

Beyond the philosophical underpinnings, 'Making Software' outlines  research results in a variety of areas.  It gives you plenty to think  about when considering various approaches on your team.  The chapter  'How Effective is Modularization?' is worth the price of the book alone.

I recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn how to think rigorously about practice.</blockquote>
