Over at the ACM blogs, Judy Robertson just asked, "<a href="http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/77886-how-do-you-assess-computational-thinking/fulltext">How do you assess computational thinking?</a>" She's more polite than I have been: she says, "It seems we're still discussing what the concept of computational thinking might include in detail, and therefore haven't got as far as defining an assessment." If (as looks increasingly likely) I'm going to spend a year updating the Software Carpentry course, I'm going to need to come up with an answer: without some way to assess the impact of the training I'm providing, I won't know if I'm solving anything more than students' immediate problems.
