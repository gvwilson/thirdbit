Guillaume Simard and Fran√ßois Fournier are writing <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> tests for Basie (our <a href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a>-based replacement for <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org">Trac</a>). Over on the Basie blog, they explain why they're using random data in their tests, rather than testing against predefined fixtures.
