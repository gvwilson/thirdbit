I am pleased to announce that in September 2010, the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto is launching a new graduate program: a Master of Science in Applied Computing. The aim of the program is  to teach the next generation of technical leaders, innovators, and entrepreneurs how to turn novel research into practical applications. Students will spend the first eight months taking courses with some of Canada's leading Computer Science researchers, and another eight months in an industrial internship, where they will apply what they have learned to real-world problems.  For more details, please see the <a href="http://web.cs.toronto.edu/program/grad/mscac.htm">program description</a>, or head on over to the <a href="https://gradapps.cs.toronto.edu/~mscac10/apply">application page</a>.
