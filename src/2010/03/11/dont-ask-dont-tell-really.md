<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/pamphlet/2009/06/18/dont-ask-dont-tell-rights-retention-for-scholarly-articles/">Good post from Stuart Shieber</a> from last summer:
<blockquote>A strange social contract has arisen in the scholarly publishing field, a kind of "don't ask, don't tell" approach to online distribution of articles by authors.  Publishers officially forbid online distribution, authors do it anyway without telling the publishers, and publishers don't ask them to stop even though it violates contractual obligations. What happens when you refuse to play that game?</blockquote>
