Today (March 24) is Ada Lovelace Day, and in her honor, we've been asked to blog about <a href="http://findingada.com/">women in computing who have inspired us</a>. My list is pretty long—current and former students, family members, and some of <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~campbell">the</a> <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~dianeh">great</a> <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~mcraig">faculty</a> at U of T—but the nod has to go to <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~reid">Karen Reid</a>. She was one of the first people I met when I started my post-doc here in 1994, and ever since I started running projects and teaching courses in 2002, she has been my co-conspirator, reality check, and role model. She does a great job of sharing her love of computer science with her students and colleagues, and somehow always has time to turn my ideas into something workable. I hope that my daughter grows up with as much passion, commitment, intelligence, enthusiasm, and integrity as Karen shows every day.

As <a href="http://moving2academia.blogspot.com/2010/03/in-honour-of-ada-lovelace-day-technical.html">Kelly Lyons</a> said, thank you to the organizers of <a href="http://findingada.com/">Ada  Lovelace Day</a> for reminding us to think about and be thankful for the  incredible technical women that have inspired us in our careers and our  lives.
