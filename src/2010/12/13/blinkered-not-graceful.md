I wasn't particularly hopeful when I first heard about <a href="http://gracelang.org/">Grace</a>, a new programming language being developed for teaching purposes. Having followed their blog for a while now, I'm positively underwhelmed:
<ol>
  <li>Early in a 21st Century full of CAD tools and other rich ways to interact with complex data, Grace's creators still insist on representing programs as sequences of ASCII tokens.</li>
  <li>Their post on Nov 4, 2010, titled "<a href="http://gracelang.org/applications/2010/11/04/lets-start-with-syntax/">Let's Start With Syntax</a>", says exactly nothing about usability testing.</li>
</ol>
Unsubscribing and moving onâ€¦
