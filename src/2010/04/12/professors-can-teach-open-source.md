Over at opensource.com, Red Hat's Greg DeKoenigsberg has a post about a new <a href="http://opensource.com/education/10/4/can-professors-teach-open-source">collaboratively-authored textbook on open source software</a> aimed squarely at undergrad courses. (I blogged about the initial announcement a couple of weeks ago.) As Máirín Duffy points out in the first comment, it's very code-centric, but in my experience, that's the right approach: students won't be ready for discussion of design until they're proficient in coding[^1]. I'm looking forward to borrowing lots from the book for <a href="http://softwarecarpentry.wordpress.com">Software Carpentry</a>…

[^1]: This is, by the way, why I believe that attempts to teach  "computational thinking" without first teaching programming are doomed  to fail, but that's a rant for another time.
