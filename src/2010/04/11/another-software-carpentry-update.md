From the last week and a half:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://softwarecarpentry.wordpress.com/2010/04/01/models-to-imitate/">Other online courses that Software Carpentry could imitate</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://softwarecarpentry.wordpress.com/2010/04/04/feedback-and-boundaries/">Feedback on the recently-completed course</a>, with a discussion of how much or how little Software Carpentry should try to accomplish.</li>
  <li>An <a href="http://softwarecarpentry.wordpress.com/2010/04/08/software-carpentry-for-economists-in-mannheim-this-autumn/">announcement</a> of <a href="http://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/gaudecker/teaching.htm">Hans-Martin von Gaudecker's course on computational skills for economists</a> this fall at Universität Mannheim.</li>
  <li>Some discussion about <a href="http://softwarecarpentry.wordpress.com/2010/04/08/platforms/">platforms for delivering the course</a>.</li>
</ul>
Lots of decisions to make in not very much time—as always, feedback and input would be appreciated.
