Mike Conley has built <a href="http://mikeconley.ca/blog/2010/02/09/take-those-code-review-requests-for-a-testdrive/">a little script</a> toâ€¦ "fetch a review request [from <a href="http://www.reviewboard.org/">ReviewBoard</a>], grab the latest diff (yes, found an easy way past the lack of API there), check out a fresh copy of <a href="http://markusproject.org">MarkUs</a>, throw down the diff, set it up with some <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">Sqlite3</a> databases, run your tests, and voila &ndash; go to localhost:3000, and you're running the review request diff." It's already helped him catch bugs that "just" reading code would have missed. Sweet.
