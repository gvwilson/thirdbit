Amid all the excitement about moving education online, we shouldn't forget that so far, doing so seems to hurt those who need help the most. As Mark Guzdial says in <a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2010/01/30/an-educational-extinction-event/">his recent blog post</a>:
<blockquote><a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2009/09/01/college-computing-educators-are-widening-the-gap-between-rich-and-poor/">Universities already widen the gap between rich and poor</a>, by flunking out or <a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2010/01/14/flagship-universities-straying-from-their-mission/">not admitting the poor</a>. On-line courses tend to<a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2009/10/12/who-educates-the-average-students/"> flunk out even more students</a>, and mostly at the lower-knowledge and poor levels…  I think it's <em><a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2009/12/14/beat-the-book-not-the-teacher/">possible</a></em><a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2009/12/14/beat-the-book-not-the-teacher/"> for on-line education to be even better than existing University education</a>, in terms of improving learning and engaging a broader range of students… [but] the work has to happen first. If [universities] disappear in favor of [online education], before we <em>make</em> [online education] better, [it] will lead to worse education for society, especially for weaker students.</blockquote>
