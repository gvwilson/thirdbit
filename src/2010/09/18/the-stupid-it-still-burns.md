Top three "non-fiction" books on Amazon.com right now:
<ol>
  <li>Matt Ridley's <em>The Rational Optimist</em>: the non-executive chairman (oh, how careful he is to emphasize the adjective) of the Northern Rock bank in the years just prior to its collapse tells us that the world is in good shape. Climate change? Pfah. He doesn't believe in it.</li>
  <li>David Limbaugh's <em>Crimes Against Liberty: An Indictment of President Barack Obama.</em> Apparently, Obama believes that, "…liberty is a threat to the government's power and something to be squashed by any means possible." If I've got my Limbaughs right, the author was (and is) a prominent supporter of the PATRIOT Act—the greatest rollback of constitutional liberties since the Second World War.</li>
  <li>Bill O'Reilly: <em>Pinheads and Patriots: Where You Stand in the Age of Obama</em>. His publicist describes his previous books as "megabestsellers"—is this Fox's equivalent of the rule that there are no models, only supermodels?</li>
</ol>
*sigh*
