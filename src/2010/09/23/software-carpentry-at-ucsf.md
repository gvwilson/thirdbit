<p>Via a comment from Scooter Morris: the University of California San Francisco is offering a "short course" variant of Software Carpentry under the course codes <a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/Outreach/bmi280/">BMI-280/BMI-219</a>. Their slides are online in S5 format, and include lots of useful stuff that aren't in the stock version.  If you know of other offerings, please send pointers!</p>
