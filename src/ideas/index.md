[Leadership Skills for Open Science](./leadership/)
:   A proposal for the next kind of workshop
    I think organizations like [the Carpentries][carpentries] need to teach.

[Harper-Lite: Simple Lesson Discovery and Aggregation](./harper/)
:   A proposal for making open access lessons easier to find and remix.

[It Will Never Work in Theory](./nwit/)
:   Short summaries of research papers in software engineering
    that I have posted since we shut down [It Will Never Work in Theory][nwit].

[Software Engineering Research Ideas](./research/)
:   Sixty-five research questions I collected from colleagues in industry;
    as far as I know, nobody has tackled any of them yet.

[Not on the Shelves](./not-on-the-shelves/)
:   A list of books I wish someone would write that I've been updating since 1997.

[Sex and Drugs and Guns and Code](./sdgc/)
:   A longer proposal for the book I most want someone smarter than me to write.

[Software Engineering: Compassion, Evidence, Process, and Tools](./secept/)
:   The other book I really want someone to write.

[Concept Maps](./concept-maps/)
:   Sketches of mental models (many translated to or from Spanish)
    that also serve as examples for [my teaching workshop][t3].

[Learner Personas](./learner-personas/)
:   A collection of data science learner personas originally developed at RStudio
    that I also use in [my teaching workshop][t3].

[Miscellaneous Advice](./advice/)
:   My thoughts on everything from how to be fired
    to how to hand over a project and move on.
