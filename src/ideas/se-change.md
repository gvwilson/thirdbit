title: "A Roadmap for Changing Software Engineering"
template: page
---

-   Want to change (people in) tech
-   Have wasted a lot of time on things that didn't work
-   So want to iterate on ideas before starting

## Goal, Strategy, and Tactics

-   Goal: want tech companies to be more ethical and responsible
    -   Which really means "want people working in tech to be ethical and responsible"
-   Strategy: raise consciousness in ways that programmers will actually engage with
    -   "Raise consciousness" ==
        "make people more aware of how the industry and our society actually work"
    -   "Will actually engage with" ==
        "hook their curiosity rather than preaching at them in ways that don't make them feel ignorant"
-   Tactics: teach the young and not-so-young
    -   Alter or replace undergraduate software engineering courses with ones that include alternative non-technical material
        (where "alternative" == "not Silicon Valley ideology")
    -   Offer short Carpentries-style workshops for people already in industry
        using material shared with those undergraduate courses
    -   Build a coalition of the willing to create, maintain, and deliver these classes and workshops

## Four Options

-   Presented in order of increasing radicalism

### Gradual Reform

-   Plan: add a little to existing courses
-   Pro:
    -   Low effort to create
    -   Less likely to frighten potential adopters
    -   Early feedback
-   Con:
    -   Won't have much impact on learners in either the short or long term
    -   First thing to be cut when time runs short (which it always does)
    -   Unlikely to excite people
    -   Unlikely to attract funding

### The Compassionate Programmer

-   Plan: teach tools, processes, evidence, and compassion in team capstone courses
    -   "Tools" because intended audience accepts them as valid
    -   "Processes" because tools aren't useful unless you know how to use them
    -   "Evidence" because we want to know which tools and processes actually work
    -   "Compassion" because once you know how to look at evidence,
        you can see how tech discriminates and the harm it causes,
        so what are you going to do about it?
-   Pro:
    -   Medium effort to create
    -   Gradual escalation from where people are to where we want them to be
    -   Ties concepts together
-   Con:
    -   Later material more likely to be cut because of time pressure (and discomfort)
    -   Hard to subsection material for workshops:
        early content is already covered elsewhere,
        later will feel like "jump in at the deep end" on its own

### Productivity, Research Methods, and Enlightened Skepticism

-   Plan: Teach programmers to distinguish reliable research from plausible punditry
    -   Use programmer productivity as the motivating issue
-   Pro:
    -   Topical: debates about impact of AI are vacuous without shared, reliable understanding of what productivity means
    -   Motivates study of both qualitative and quantitative methods
    -   Highlights the difference between evidence-based argument and self-confident and/or self-serving opinions
    -   Practical exercises are easy to create
-   Con:
    -   Medium effort to create
    -   May be seen as niche (people won't understand productivity is just being used as a working example)

### Social Studies for Software Engineers

-   Plan: Summarize key insights from social sciences that are directly related to tech industry
    -   Who decides what's allowed on the internet?
    -   Why don't software engineers need to be licensed?
    -   Does strong encryption do more harm than good?
-   Pro:
    -   Addresses the end goal directly
    -   Content (and controversy) might attract attention outside tech
    -   An opportunity to connect with people outside tech
-   Con:
    -   Large effort to create
    -   Potential instructors will have to learn the content as well
    -   Will require partnership with people outside tech
        who may not understand what programmers are willing to sit through
    -   Will be seen as "political" (and encounter resistance as a result)
