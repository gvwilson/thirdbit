I didn't know any R when I joined RStudio back in 2018,
so my first project was to write a guide to the language for Python programmers.
I set it aside when RStudio laid me off in 2021;
a few bits are now out of date,
but I have [put it online][tidynomicon] anyway
in the hope that it might be useful
(and as a way to procrastinate when I should be revising [my current project][sdxpy]).
As with all the technical writing on this site
