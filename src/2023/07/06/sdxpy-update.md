The Python version of [*Software Design by Example*][sdxjs] is getting closer.
Here's where the content is falling short of my targets right now:

| Content   | Chapters Under Target |

| Slides    |                  2/27 |
| Exercises |                  9/27 |
| Figures   |                 13/27 |
| Words     |                  7/27 |

The syllabus has also evolved a bitâ€”I still need to figure out
how to tie those three isolated chapters into the main narrative.

Finally,
the glossary now has 336 entries;
only 289 terms are indexed,
but that's always the very last step (at least for me).
There are 34 open issues in the book's GitHub repository
that will take anything from a few minutes to half a day to close,
and 7 suggestions for chapters in a second volume
that I've promised myself I'm not going to write.
