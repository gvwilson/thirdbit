Years ago,
after losing yet another week to a bout of depression,
I finally took [my younger brother][jeff]'s advice and went to see a therapist.
When I called him up after my first session
to tell him what I'd done,
he laughed and asked,
"Who won?"

Time to make another cup of tea.
If you came in peace, be welcome; if not, be damned with you.
