Years ago, when we were living in England,
I came across this wonderful guide
to building carboard box robot costumes for children:

After we got back to Canada and found a house to live in,
I ordered a copy online and gave it to my daughter (then age 9)
as a Christmas present.
It languished on her shelf for several years
until I finally asked her why we'd never actually made anything from it.
Her answer was,
"Every time I asked, you said you were too busy."

I only remember her asking once,
but I do remember making an excuse then about not having a box the right size
and maybe we could think about it on the weekend.
Her explanation stuck in my head like a raspberry seed between my teeth,
though,
so the next time Christmas came around
I made a little cardboard box costume for one of her stuffed animals.
She just rolled her eyes when I gave it to her:
she was now very much a teenager,
and whatever window might once have been open had closed.
My advice to you is there to build robots whenever you can.

Time to make another cup of tea.
If you came in peace, be welcome;
if not, be damned with you.
