Rainbow Railroad is a global non-profit organization
that helps LGBTQ+ refugees from state violence resettle in safe countries.
Since its founding it has helped almost 10,000 LGBTQI+ individuals find safety
through emergency relocation, crisis response, cash assistance, and other forms of aid.
My settlement team is trying to raise $16,500 to help a Ugandan lesbian come to Canada.
If you can help, please do.
