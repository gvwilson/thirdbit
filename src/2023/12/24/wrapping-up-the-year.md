title: "Wrapping Up the Year"
date: 2023-12-24

With seven days left in the year,
I think it's safe to do a retrospective on
[my goals](@root/2023/01/01/plans-for-the-year/):

-   Finish one of the children's books I've been writing off and on for the last few years:
    nope.

-   Sell one short story:
    nope.

-   Wrap up the [Python version of *Software Design by Example*][sdxpy]:
    it has gone off to the printer,
    and should be available by April,
    but I no longer believe in the project.
    The [JavaScript version][sdxjs] has sold fewer than 300 copies in its first year,
    and most of those were to institutions
    that buy one or two copies of every new book from my publisher.
    I enjoyed [teaching the Python material online][online-class],
    but working through examples as a way of learning software design
    doesn't seem to appeal to as many people as I hoped it would.

-   Help organize another series of lightning talks for [*It Will Never Work in Theory*][nwit]:
    yup,
    but we then wound the project down.
    I don't know what it will take to get programmers and researchers to listen to one another,
    but *NWIT* hasn't worked,
    and any attempt to keep it going right now would be trampled in the AI goldrush.
    We have written a two-page "lessons learned" on the project
    that we hope will appear in one of the IEEE journals some time next year.

-   Refurbish my dad's reclining chair:
    yup.
    I'm sitting in it now…

-   Terrace the back half of our back yard:
    nope,
    but we did get some new windows in
    and finished renovations to the kitchen and bathroom.

-   Pick up another musical instrument:
    nope.
    Between the tenosynovitis in my right hand and wrist pain in my left,
    the only instrument I could possibly play right now is the trombone,
    and I don't think my family and neighbors would appreciate it.

A few other things happened this year that weren't planned:

-   My daughter got her black belt in karate.
    It has taken ten years,
    and she's had to overcome recurrent back problems,
    but we are very proud of her.

-   My wife and I joined a [Rainbow Railroad][rr] team
    that is helping a Ugandan lesbian immigrate to Canada
    in order to escape state-sponsored violence in her own country.

-   I appeared in [Episode 460][episode-460] of the [Embedded.fm][embedded] podcast.

-   I made two abortive attempts to restart
    [a book on software engineering][interruptions]
    that uses topics like "how to run a meeting" and "how to do performance evaluations"
    to motivate discussion of professional responsibility,
    (un)fairness at work,
    and other things that most books on the subject ignore.
    Turns out,
    [I still don't know enough to write this][ultracrepidarian].

-   [The Carpentries][carpentries] laid off half their staff.
    I have only been peripherally involved with the organization since stepping down in 2017,
    but this still hurt.

So what about 2024?

-   I want to run [the teaching workshop][t3] a few more times,
    both to raise money for [Rainbow Railroad][rr]
    and because [it makes me feel useful][directions].

-   I want to find something to learn that excites me.
    A new musical instrument is out because of my hand;
    I've thought about reviving my French,
    picking up some Spanish,
    diving into Postgres or machine learning (yeah, yeah, I know, don't hate me),
    but none of them are making my heart race.

-   Terrace the back yard,
    fix the concrete in the front,
    and throw out a third of what's in our basement.

-   Finally,
    I want to finish one of those children's books and get it published.
    In aid of that,
    I'd like to find a writing group in Toronto—I was briefly part of one twenty years ago,
    but it no longer exists
    and the all-comers meetups I've tried have been pretty scattershot.
    This would partly be a way to keep myself honest about writing,
    but I'm also increasingly concerned about becoming socially isolated:
    I talk to fewer people in a normal week than I did before COVID,
    and if I don't make an effort,
    I worry that the trend will continue downward.
