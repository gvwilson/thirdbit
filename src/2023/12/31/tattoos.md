Someone asked me if I had any tattoos,
and if so,
why I got them and how I decided what to get.
So:
my first tattoo was a couple of chess pieces in memory of my younger brother
after he passedâ€”we used to play every time we got to together.
My second was "Integritas",
which was my dad's old school motto,
and then I got a mouse knitting a scarf because my mum was a knitter and my sister collected toy mice.
This way,
the family I've lost are with me all the time.

Time to make another cup of tea.
If you came in peace, be welcome;
if not,
may you have a peaceful new year anyway.
