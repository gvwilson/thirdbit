If you and your team are looking for an entertaining and informative lunch-and-learn session,
I am willing to give any of the five talks listed below via video conferencing
in exchange for a donation of US$200 or more to [Rainbow Railroad](https://donate.rainbowrailroad.org/team/515984),
a non-profit group that helps LGBTQI+ people escape state-sponsored violence.
(I hope to add a sixth talk based on [*Software Design by Example*][sdxjs] by May
if that would be more interesting.)
If you're interested,
please [reach out](mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com).

1.  [Writing a Technical Book][writing-book]
2.  [Software Design in 50 Minutes][sd]
    (aimed primarily at data scientists and others without formal training in software engineering)
3.  [Software Engineering's Greatest Hits][se]
    (a short summary of some of the most interesting results from [It Will Never Work in Theory][nwit])
4.  [What Everyone in Tech Should Know About Teaching and Learning][teach]
5.  [How to Run a Meeting][meeting]
