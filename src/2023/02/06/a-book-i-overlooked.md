I realized this morning that I left
*Programming Languages: An Interpreter-Based Approach*
out of the acknowledgments for [*Software Design by Example*][sdxjs]:

I learned almost everything I know about how programs actually work from reading it.
The first chapter builds a tiny little languageâ€”basically, a calculator for simple arithmetic expressions.
Each subsequent chapter adds a feature like lists, variables, or functions,
but rather than presenting a single design
Kamin talks through alternatives.
How could variable scoping work?
How *should* it work,
and how do implementation details and ease of use affect each other?
Its approach was one of the inspirations for [*500 Lines or Less*][500lines],
and it's one of the few books I would put beside Kernighan's classics for the clarity of its prose.
My copy disappeared years ago,
but if you can find one,
it still has a lot to teach.
