title: "It Will Never Work in Theory: April 2023 Lightning Talks"
date: 2023-02-23
---

Registration is now open for our third live event!
Join us April 25-26 for another series of online lightning talks
and hear leading software engineering researchers summarize what we know about everything from
what makes developers thrive
to how you can create the nastiest test inputs ever.
Details and previous talks are at <https://neverworkintheory.org/>,
and all the money raised will go support [Books for Africa](https://www.booksforafrica.org/).

In order to make these talks as accessible as possible,
we are offering tickets at two prices,
and the two sessions will run at different timesâ€”a single ticket is good for both,
and we will be announcing more speakers soon.
