      <a href="https://donate.rainbowrailroad.org">Rainbow Railroad</a> is a global nonprofit organization
      that helps at-risk LGTBQI+ people get to safety worldwide.
      Since its founding
      it has helped almost 10,000 people find safety through emergency relocation,
      crisis response,
      cash assistance,
      and other forms of aid.

In order to raise money to help them do their work,
I am offering to run one-day workshops on teaching and learning online
(or in person if you're between Windsor and Quebec City).
The material is a shortened and updated version of
lessons originally developed for
[the Carpentries][carpentries]' instructor training program
and RStudio's [instructor certification program][rstudio-ed],
and will help you design and deliver lessons for onboarding new team members,
technical support,
and self-paced learning
as well as more in formal classroom settings.
Topics include:

-   creating learner personas
-   why novices, competent practitioners, and experts need different lessons
-   managing cognitive load
-   formative and summative assessment
-   what motivates and demotivates learners
-   teaching as a performance art
