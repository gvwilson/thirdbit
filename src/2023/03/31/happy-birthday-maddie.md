Our daughter turned 16 today.
We gave her a bracelet made of spoons (so that she'll never run out)
and a one-cup blender for making smoothies,
and then my wife went to her closet and got
a package my mum sent four years ago to be opened on this day.
Inside were half a dozen pottery figurines that were on the mantel when I was a kid.

I wish mum was here,
but I'm pleased that the last gift she will ever give was to my daughter.
Happy Birthday, Maddieâ€”you've come a long way.
