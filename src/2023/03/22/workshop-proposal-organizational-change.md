I just submitted the proposal shown below for a workshop at the US-RSE
conference in October 2023; fingers crossed, I'll see you there.

## Workshop Proposal: Organizational Change

A lot has changed in the last 25 years: open access journals have proven that
they can work, most scientific research is powered (at least in part) by open
source software, and there is greater awareness and discussion of equity and
inclusivity shortcomings.  But a lot of things haven't changed or have gotten
worse:

- A handful of large publishing companies continue to extract exorbitant rents
  for "allowing" us to read our own work.

- Academic life is increasingly arduous, insecure, and under-funded, and
  "awareness" and "discussion" are only rarely translated into effective action.

- The tools that have allowed researchers to share ideas have also helped foster
  and spread anti-scientific disinformation on the climate crisis, vaccines, and
  hundreds of other topics, leading directly to the loss of millions of lives.

Advocates of openness, fairness, and truth often act as if being right was
enough to guarantee victory, but this has never been a winning strategy.  While
systemic change starts with like-minded idealists working together it only has
impact when people take on the hard work of organizing in the large to build a
larger and more active constituency for change.

This half-day workshop presents practical advice for doing this drawn from the
author's experience and from works in other fields. Working in small groups,
participants will develop and share plans inspired by the following rules:

- Be sure this is where you want to focus your efforts.
- Start by playing in someone else's band.
- Ask those who will be affected and listen to what they say.
- Be specific about the change you want (but not too specific).
- Figure out who actually has power and what they care about.
- Build alliances.
- Test the waters.
- Keep it visible.
- Collect data but tell stories.
- Learn how to run meetings and make decisions.
- Celebrate when you can, grieve when you need to.

This workshop can accommodate up to 30 participants.  Group sign-ups are
particularly welcome, since people are more likely to follow through on their
plans if they develop them together.

Each segment of the workshop will consist of a 5-10 minute presentation, 10-15
minutes of group work on one of the points above, and 10-15 minutes of
whole-group discussion.
