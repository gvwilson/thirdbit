[Back in 2004][new_standard_model] I summarized the [new Standard Model][wikipedia_standard_model] of computing.
I was taught its predecessor, which included:

-   a character-oriented editor (usually Vi or Emacs);
-   C (which mutated into C++);
-   Unix command-line tools like `cat` and `grep`;
-   lines of text as a data exchange format;
-   Make for task automation;
-   CVS for version control; and
-   "power tools" like Yacc and Awk for more complex tasks.

By 2004, that had become:

-   Eclipse and its many plugins for editing;
-   Java;
-   XML as a data exchange format;
-   Ant for building and JUnit for testing;
-   reflection and things it enabled, like JavaBeans; and
-   an online project dashboard that includes a ticket manager and a searchable mailing list archive.

So what's in the standard model of the early 2020s?
Based on my experience over the last four years, my first stab is:

-   Python and a relational database (SQLite or Postgres);
-   HTTP and JSON for data exchange;
-   JavaScript and a front-end framework (e.g., React);
-   Docker and [name of cloud goes here] for deployment;
-   Slack for communication;
-   Git for version control;
-   GitHub as a project dashboard;
-   GitHub again for linting and testing; and
-   Stack Overflow as an external brainspace expander.

Lots of substitutions are obviously possible,
like Mongo instead of a relational database or Linear instead of GitHub for issues,
but I think this is the baseline against which variations are defined.
If I've missed anything or included anything that you think people _don't_ now take for granted,
please let me know.
