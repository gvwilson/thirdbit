The [penultimate chapter][sdxjs_debugger] of [*Software Design by Example*][sdxjs]
explores one of the question that sparked this book:
how does an interactive breakpointing debugger work?
The first time I saw one in action I was completely baffled.
How could the computer stop where I wanted and then keep going?
How could it interact with me?
Finding out was a lot harder than it should have been:
there were (and are) lots of books and courses on compilers and operating systems,
but nothing that explained the workings of this magical, powerful tool.

This chapter answers my long-ago questions by building a simple single-stepping debugger
It also shows how to create unit tests for interactive applications.
That's a lot to pack into just two thousand words,
but most of the ideas have come up before.

I'm pleased that I was able to answer my younger self's questions.
However,
I'm still annoyed by the way debuggers are mostly left out of the curriculum.
Of the forty-odd students I interviewed for software engineering intern positions last year,
fewer than a dozen knew how to set a breakpoint in an IDE.
Andreas Zeller's [*The Debugging Book*][debugging_book] has [a very informative chapter][debugging_chapter],
and I recommend the whole book to every working programmer,
but I'll believe our profession is serious about building code that works
when every undergraduate computer science program has a full-semester course
on how to use tools to find and fix bugs.
