I moved from industry to academia in 2007.
In the three years that followed,
all five of the grant applications I submitted to NSERC were rejected:
despite people in academia saying,
"We want more collaboration with practitioners,"
the academic system as a whole had what was essentially an immune response
to someone whose background and interests didn't fit within very narrow parameters.
I don't think it was just me—I know several other people with similar experiences—and
I think that until that's fixed,
most people in industry will either stay there
or have only short, unsatisfying stints in universities.

As a footnote,
the two things that NSERC decided weren't worth funding
turned into [Software Carpentry][software-carpentry]
and [The Architecture of Open Source Applications][aosa].
I think both would have produced a host of useful insights
if they'd included significant self-study/evaluation components right from the start:
that's what I wanted NSERC to fund.
However,
that's not the timeline we're in…

And as another footnote,
I really miss working with students—so much so that
I run ad hoc programming classes for lab scientists where I work
and write books like [*Software Design by Example*][sdxjs] in my spare time.
But the last time I said,
"Maybe I should think about giving university life another try,"
my wife's reply was,
"Look, if you want a divorce, just say you want a divorce."
