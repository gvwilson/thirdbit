title: "Software Design by Example Summary"
date: 2023-01-29
---

I wrote 22 posts this month to summarize the chapters in [*Software Design by Example*][sdxjs]
and to ask [who'd be interested in taking an online class based on its Python successor][class].
The list below links to each post in the series,
and to the terms defined in each of the book's content chapters.

My next goal is to prepare an hour-long talk summarizing what I learned from writing this book.
It will cover some of the same material as ["Software Design for Data Scientists"][sd4ds] and [this paper][paper],
but will focus more on how to teach design and what junior programmers are ready to learn.
If you or your team would like to listen to me ramble,
I'd be very happy to deliver it online in exchange for a small donation to a mutually-agreed charityâ€”please [reach out](mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com)
if you're interested.
