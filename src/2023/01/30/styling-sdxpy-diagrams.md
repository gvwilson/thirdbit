title: "Styling Diagrams for Software Design by Example"

I use [draw.io][draw_io] to create diagrams for my books.
Right now I use Comic Sans as a font
and the sketch style pioneered by [rough.js][rough_js]
because [people give more honest feedback on work that looks rough][t3_rough]:

<div class="center">
  <img src="@root/files/2023/rough_comic.svg" alt="Comic Sans and sketch style">
</div>

I recently switched to the [Atkinson Hyperlegible][atkinson_font] font for this site
to improve accessibility,
and am wondering whether my diagrams would be easier for people to read
if I did the same.
My options are to use Atkinson Hyperlegible with the sketch style:

<div class="center">
  <img src="@root/files/2023/rough_atkinson_export.svg" alt="Comic Sans and sketch style">
</div>

or to use it with a smooth drawing style:

<div class="center">
  <img src="@root/files/2023/smooth_atkinson_export.svg" alt="Comic Sans and sketch style">
</div>

If you have a preference, please [let me know](mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com).
I'd be grateful if you could also let me know if you have visual difficulties or work with people who do,
since my main concern is accessibility rather than aesthetics.
Thanks in advance for your help.
