title: "Commands I Use"

Unix commands I've used recently in order of descending frequency according to `history` and `sort -n`:

- `git` (but this is a cheat, since it's really a family of commands)
- `ls`
- `emacs` (another cheat - I effectively run a lot of commands inside Emacs)
- `cd`
- `make` (all of my projects have Makefiles)
- `fg` (because I frequently background Emacs, run a command or two, and then foreground it)
- `rm`
- `ta`/`tl`/`td` (commands for my to-do list manager)
- `jobs` (see the note above about `fg`)
- `fgrep`
- `open` (to launch applications from the command line on Mac)
- `bg` (see the note above about `fg`)
- `rmdir`
- `history`
- `date`
- `mv`
- `find`
- `clean` (a script I wrote to delete junk files)
- `cal`
- `which`
- `python` (misleadingly low count: I run this from inside `make` or inside Emacs)
- `mkdir`
- `less`
- `conda`
- `cat`
