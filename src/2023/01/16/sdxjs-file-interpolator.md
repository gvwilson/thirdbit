Many of the examples in [*Software Design by Example*][sdxjs]
are too long to show comfortably in one block of code on a printed page,
so I needed a way to break them up.
As an experiment,
I wrote a custom module loader
that reads a source file that has specially-formatted comments containing the names of other files,
and then reads and inserts those files before running the code.
Modern programming languages don't work this way,
but it's how C and C++ handle header files
and how static site generators do snippet inclusion.

I decided to use a different approach in the end
because ESLint didn't know what to make of file inclusions.
Despite being a dead end,
I thought the inclusion tool was [worth a chapter][sdxjs_interpolator]
because it shows how programs turn source code into something executable.
I also thought it was important to have a least one example of a working dead end
so that readers would be comfortable when their ideas did what they were supposed to
but still shouldn't be put into production.
