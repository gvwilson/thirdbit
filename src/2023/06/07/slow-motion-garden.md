My wife and I woke up three weeks ago to discover that
we had finally [paid off our mortgage](@root/2023/05/19/paid-off/).
Forty minutes later a roofing crew showed up to start reshingling our house:
winter storms had stripped most of the south side of the roof,
and we had a choice between hitting the line of credit to fix it now
or waiting until there was water damage and spending even more.

This evening,
we discovered that there's a slow leak under the kitchen sink.
Fixing it requires more skill and courage than we have,
so a plumber is going to come by tomorrow.
All of this reminds me of something my father once said:
a house is like a slow-motion garden.
Owning one isn't like owning a book or a table;
you can't just put it somewhere and expect it not to change between one day and the next.
You have to tend to it as you would a plum tree or a patch of garlicâ€”it
just lives its life at a slower pace.

Time to make another cup of tea.
If you came in peace, be welcome.
