I biked into the office last Thursday,
only to discover that I'd forgotten to bring a clean shirt.
A colleague told me that Winners opened at 8:00 am,
so I rode down there and bought the only thing that fit me
that didn't feel like it was made of recycled plastic bags.
Got back to work,
changed,
walked into the office,
and one of my colleagues looked me up and down and said,
"Well, Happy Pride to you too."

Time to make another cup of tea.
If you came in peace, be welcome.
If not, be damned with you.
