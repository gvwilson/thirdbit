Sex and Drugs and Guns and Code

Greg Wilson

Most young programmers have only ever been exposed to one worldview:
the toxic strain of neoliberal capitalism favored by venture
capitalists and their gushing fans in the tech media.  As inequality
widens and racist nationalism makes a comeback, as we do everything in
our power to make climate change *worse* while companies like X,
Facebook, and Shopify tie themselves in knots to avoid responsibility
for their actions, most programmers don't have the intellectual tools
to understand what's wrong and how we might fix it.

Lots of books give cogent answers to these questions, but programmers
who have never done a civics course are not going to read nine
thousand pages on a whim.  However, they *might* sit through a
one-semester course that explains why the human side of software
engineering is harder than the technical side.  This talk outlines
what such a course might cover: why "flat" organizations make power
imbalances worse rather than better, why discrimination persists
despite its economic inefficiency, how regulatory capture works, why
Americans keep shooting one another, and what can we learn about big
tech by studying drug cartels.
