Tressie McMillan Cottom: *[Lower Ed][lower-ed]: The Troubling Rise of For-Profit Colleges in the New Economy*.
Describes how a large part of the educational sector in the US exists
to translate government grants into personal debt for the poor and private profit for the rich.

Andro Linklater: *[Owning the Earth][owning-earth]*.

and its emergence holds a lot of lessons for today's debates over intellectual property.

Leigh Phillips and Michal Rozworski: *[The People's Republic of Walmart][peoples-walmart]*.
Most of the world's economic activity occurs within large companies like Walmart and Amazon.
They all use central planning:
why doesn't the economy as a whole,
and can we make the efficiencies of planning democratically accountable?

## Abstract

Most young programmers have only ever been exposed to one worldview:
the toxic strain of neoliberal capitalism favored by venture capitalists and their gushing fans in the tech media.
As inequality widens and racist nationalism makes a comeback,
as we do everything in our power to make climate change *worse*
while companies like X, Facebook, and Shopify tie themselves in knots to avoid responsibility for their actions,
most programmers don't have the intellectual tools to understand what's wrong and how we might fix it.

Lots of books give cogent answers to these questions,
but programmers who have never done a civics course
are not going to read nine thousand pages on a whim.
However,
they *might* sit through a one-semester course that explains why the human side of software engineering
is harder than the technical side.
This talk outlines what such a course might cover:
why "flat" organizations make power imbalances worse rather than better,
why discrimination persists despite its economic inefficiency,
how regulatory capture works,
why Americans keep shooting one another,
and what can we learn about big tech by studying drug cartels.
