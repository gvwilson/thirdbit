Title: A Hard-Boiled Egg: Data Science, Software Engineering, and a Plausible Path to a Slightly Better Future

Abstract: Many people offer utopian or dystopian visions of a world transformed by computing. In this talk, we present something more modest but more achievable: a world in which normal people can analyze data and collaborate at scale without heroic effort.  We also present a roadmap for getting there, one which involves making statistical methods and the use of advanced tools the twin engines of software engineering education.

Speaker: Dr. Greg Wilson has worked for 35 years in both industry and academia, and is the author or editor of several books on computing and two for children. He is best known as the co-founder of Software Carpentry, a non-profit organization that teaches basic computing skills to researchers, and is now part of the education team at RStudio.
