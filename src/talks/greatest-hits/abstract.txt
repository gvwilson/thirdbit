Are some programmers really ten times more productive than others? Does test-driven development produce better code faster? Does the order in which files are presented for code review affect the review? And does strong typing actually catch or prevent bugs? We now have answers to these questions and more, but most of those answers remain locked behind academic paywalls or are only ever presented at research conferences that practitioners don't attend. This hour-long talk draws on https://neverworkintheory.org/ to explore what we now know, explain why we believe it's true, and show how working programmers can make use of it.
