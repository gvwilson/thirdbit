## Once Upon a Time…

-   Book review editor for *[Doctor Dobb's Journal](http://drdobbs.com)*

-   Hundreds of textbooks on compilers, but none on debuggers or debugging

    -   Or build tools, or package managers, or…

## What Do You Want and Why?

-   Most people have a to-do list

-   A to-don't list is just as useful

    -   Things you have to remind yourself not to start

    -   Because life is short and you're busy

-   But other people may be looking for ideas

-   And explaining *why* I want these may help you understand what practitioners actually want from researchers

    -   Because I am really tired of our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Solitudes_(Canadian_society)">two solitudes</a>
