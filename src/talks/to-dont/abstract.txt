Most people use a to-do list to keep track of things they need to do.
It's just as useful to have a to-don't list of things that would be
fun, interesting, and worthwhile, but that you're not actually going
to start because life is short and you're too busy for yet another
side project.  This talk describes some of the projects on my to-don't
list; I hope that by explaining why I think they're interesting, I
will help you understand what practitioners actually want from
software engineering research (and computer science more generally).
