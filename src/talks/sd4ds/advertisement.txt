Data scientists routinely build complex pieces of software, but many feel lost when it comes to thinking and talking about software design. This talk introduces ten different heuristics for doing that, from keeping cognitive load manageable through the use of patterns to designing for testability, evolution, security, and inclusiveness.

We are offering this talk as an online webinar on [DATE]; if you'd like a preview, the slides are available online under a Creative Commons license at https://third-bit.com/talks/sd4ds/. Thanks to the generosity of Taylor & Francis, every participant will receive an e-book from their extensive list of data science titles. To register to take part, please go to [URL]. The cost is US$15 for people in affluent countries and US$5 for people elsewhere, and all proceeds will be donated to Books for Africa (https://www.booksforafrica.org/).
