Most people can lift one kilogram, but would struggle to lift one hundred, and could not lift a thousand without planning and support. Similarly, many researchers who can write a few lines of Python or JavaScript for a homework assignment struggle to create programs that are a few hundred lines long, and don't know where to start designing an application containing dozens or hundreds of files.

This talk presents a dozen tips that can help with the design of large programs drawn from the research literature, conversations with talented programmers, and the author's own experience. If you find yourself sketching data structures on the whiteboard, thinking about how different configuration options interact, or wondering how you're going to support old releases while working on the new one, these tips may help.
