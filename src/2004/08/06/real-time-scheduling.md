<p>In <a href="http://www.jrothman.com/weblog/archive/2004_05_01_mpdarchive.html#108361096283936713">this blog posting</a> from May 2004, Johanna Rothman talks about how easy it is to build a schedule for a small project using just yellow sticky notes.  Back in June, I commented on Roy Osherove's <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2004/06/18/158720.aspx">whiteboard-based project management</a>, and asked for links to software tools that were as easy to collaborate with.  None were forthcoming, but thanks to Michelle Levesque's recent experience at <a href="http://insanecats.com/cgi-bin/single.py?month=jul04&amp;msg=31">VanPy</a>, I now know where to look.</p>

<p>Michelle saw people in several conference sessions using <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a> to take notes collaboratively.  For those who haven't seen it, SEE allows any number of people to edit a single document simultaneously.  It sounds like a recipe for chaos, but if authors are willing to follow a few obvious social rules, it can be tremendously productive.  Michelle and <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca">Karen Reid</a> are already thinking about having students use it during lectures to take a single, shared set of notes (and about how to prevent the one bad apple in every class from spoiling it).</p>

<p>I'm now wondering whether something like SEE could make electronic schedule construction as easy as whiteboards and yellow sticky notes.  I know that wikis can be used this way, but wikis feel like email and turn-based games, while SEE has the zing of instant messaging and real-time games [<a href="#1">1</a>].  Schedule negotiation <em>feels</em> like it needs rapid, interactive give-and-take, at least for small projects (a dozen programmers, a dozen months).</p>

<p>So, let me ask my question again: who's building rapid-fire interactive scheduling and tracking tools using collaborative editing?  Anyone?  Anyone at all?</p>
