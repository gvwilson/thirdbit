Studies of speed dating have shown that men typically ask for follow-ups with about half of the women they spend a few minutes with, while women only want to follow up with about a third of men.  This is easy for the "evolution is psychology" crowd to explain: females are almost always pickier than males in choosing mates because they have to make a greater investment in any offspring that result.

Except it turns out that explanation is wrong, or at least suspect. As <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090602/full/news.2009.537.html"><em>Nature</em> reports</a>, speed dating services typically have women stay seated while men walk around. Reverse that, and the follow-up rates even out.  Who'd a thunk it?
