Interesting new paper titled "<a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(09)01109-9">Tool-use induces morphological updating of the body schema</a>", summarized in this <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2009/06/23/to-the-brain-tools-are-temporary-body-parts/"><em>Discover</em> blog post</a>: "using a tool for even a brief amount of time caused volunteers to update their body schema, and to consider the tool a part of their bodies."  The effect is subtle, but measurable.  Question: how many software tools have this effect?
