Interesting <a href="http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/radjou/2009/06/rd-20-fewer-engineers-more-ant.html">article</a> by Navi Radjou about R&amp;D investments in developing countries by multinationals requiring more anthropologists and fewer engineers than those companies may be used to.  The same applies at a local level: companies that are used to working with large, closed organizations like banks often need to do a lot of mental re-gearing when they first tackle community-oriented mashups.
