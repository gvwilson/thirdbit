I was wowed by Microsoft PowerShell (originally called Monad) when it first appeared, and have stayed wowed since. I wondered a couple of yeas ago whether someone would hook it up to Yahoo! Pipes; now I'm wondering about integration with <a href="http://github.com/micha/resty/tree/master">Resty</a>, a utility that lets you connect to REST web services from a standard Unix pipe.  Distributed dataflow networks that pass objects around?  That would be cool…

<em>Later: a couple of people have pointed me at <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2009/04/yql_execute.html">YQL Execute</a>—another piece of the emerging puzzle.</em>
