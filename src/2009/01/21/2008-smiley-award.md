On September 19, 1982, CMU's Scott E. Fahlman posted a message on the department's online bulletin-board system proposing that we use <strong>:-)</strong> as a symbol for "I'm just kidding" and <strong>:-(</strong> as a symbol for "This is serious". In celebration of this <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/smiley/sa.html#1">pivotal event in the history of human communication </a>, the Department of Computer Science of Carnegie Mellon University established an annual <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/smiley/sa.html">Smiley Award</a> for innovation in technology-assisted person-to-person communication. This year's winners are Jennifer Gooch and Turadg Aleahmad for "One Cold Hand? A Site for the Collection and Reunion of Pittsburgh's Dropped Gloves".
