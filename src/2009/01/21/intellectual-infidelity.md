I'm a long-time reader of <a href="http://www.newscientist.com"><em>New Scientist</em></a> (I even wrote a few articles for them back in the 1980s and early 1990s), but having browed BBC's new <a href="http://www.bbcknowledgemagazine.com/"><em>Knowledge Magazine</em></a>, I'm seriously tempted to stray…  But it makes me wonder yet again: where are the Carl Sagans and David Suzukis of computing?  Lots of people write about what's going on in our industry, but there don't seem to be any rock-star popularizers for the science.  (Go ahead, make me an offer…)
