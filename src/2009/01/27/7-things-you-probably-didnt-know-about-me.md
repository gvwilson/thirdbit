I've been tagged by <a href="http://insanecats.com/cgi-bin/single.py?month=jan09&amp;msg=25">Michelle Levesque</a> and <a href="http://mindforks.blogspot.com">David Bolter</a>, so I figure I better respond:
<ol>
  <li>My father was my English teacher from Grade 8 to Grade 12.  (It was a small town…)</li>
  <li>My first paid-for publication was a description of an Inuit cult for a role-playing game I'd never actually played.  Thirty years later, I still pretend to know more about obscure things than I actually do.</li>
  <li>My left calf is an inch smaller in diameter than my right one—I tore the muscle playing Ultimate frisbee, started favoring my strong leg, and have never properly re-balanced.</li>
  <li><em>The Mummy</em> is my favorite movie of all time.</li>
  <li>I used to be pretty good with a railgun.</li>
  <li>I haven't driven a car since 1992. You should be grateful for that.</li>
  <li>Pickled beets make me nauseous.  Even just <em>thinking</em> about them makes me…  Uh oh…</li>
</ol>
