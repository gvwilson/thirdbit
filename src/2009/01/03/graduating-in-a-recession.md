Via Serguei Zinine, a <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/%7Evw2112/papers/nber_draft_1.pdf">draft paper</a> looking at the effects on students' financial prospects of graduating during a recession. Charts with results start on pg. 47.

<em>Later: <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~dianeh">Diane Horton</a> pointed out that they only analyzed men; the word "women" comes up only once in 73 pages. I'm embarrassed that I didn't notice this myself.</em>
