title: "Graduate Students"

Along with students doing course-sized consulting projects, I have a metric passle of graduate students who are starting to converge on thesis topics:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://littlecomputerscientist.wordpress.com/">Aran Donohue</a> may look at the cognitive processes involved in reading code (we're still negotiating).</li>
  <li>Alecia Fowler wants to <a href="http://ajfowler.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/the-problem/">make map data accessible</a>.</li>
  <li>Alicia Grubb is going to figure out <a href="http://www.reproducibleresearch.org/">what reproducible research is really all about</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://zkincaid.blogspot.com/">Zachary Kincaid</a> will probably do something related to safety proofs for concurrent programs with <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~azadeh/">Prof. Azadeh Farzan</a>.</li>
  <li>Jason Montojo plans to study <a href="http://www.jaysnothere.com/blog/?p=41">how people learn their way around new code</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://skoolr.blogspot.com/">Jon Pipitone</a> (who is actually one of <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sme">Prof. Steve Easterbrook</a>'s students, but we talk a lot) wants to make climate change modeling data more accessible—ideally, web accessible to Grade 10 science students.</li>
  <li><a href="http://rorytulk.blogspot.com/">Rory Tulk</a> would like to do something related to continuous integration: despite its popularity in industry, there's been very little academic study of it.</li>
</ul>
Meanwhile, the three students in my first cohort are supposed to be submitting their theses before the end of the month, but they're all now several weeks behind schedule. Being a prof turns out to be a whole lot like being any other kind of manager…
