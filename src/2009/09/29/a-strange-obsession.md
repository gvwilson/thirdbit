title: A Strange Obsession
---

I just spent a few minutes browsing
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/102785/GridKA_2009.pdf">these slides</a>
from a talk given in Karlsruhe in September by Microsoft's
Fabrizio Gagliardi.  The talk's title was "Cloud Computing for
Scientific Research", and it's chock-full of big: mega-this,
peta-that, and isn't it all exciting? The only mention of anything at
the desktop scale is on slide 19, which mentions a plugin to allow
MATLAB to talk to the cloud, and Excel views of Azure data. Once
again, I'm puzzled (and a bit disappointed) that the world's premier
desktop software company has decided to ignore
what most scientists care about most. I'm equally disappointed that there was nothing at
all in these slides about improving scientists' skills, especially
since Microsoft has invested so heavily in improving its own
processes. Oh wellâ€¦
