Back in June, a high school student contacted me by email to say that he'd like to learn more about programming. Ten weeks later, he has built <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNGzRmnv-Q8">this</a> not-so-simple physics engine using Python and Pygame, and is now learning web programming with Django. I think he's having fun; I know I am, and I'm grateful for the chance to pay forward all the opportunities and extra time that my teachers gave me over the years. I haven't spoken to Mr. Biczo, Mr. Taylor, Mr. Dowd, Prof. Woodside, or Prof. Wallace in years, but I'd like to think they'd approve.
