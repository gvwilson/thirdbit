title: "Jon Udell on Computational Thinking"

As I've said several times, I'm suspicious of the hoopla around "computational thinking": as far as I can tell, most people hoist it as a flag of convenience above whatever agenda they were already pushing.  One of the notable exceptions is Jon Udell, who recently gave <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/judell/computational-thinking">a talk on the subject</a> to (in his words) non-geek university folks. It's the most concrete interpretation of the term I've come across, i.e., there's a clear list of included capabilities with illustrative examples to show exactly what they would mean in practice.  As we <a href="http://softwarecarpentry.wordpress.com/2009/03/30/user-stories/">re-design</a> Software Carpentry to emphasize computer-supported collaborative science, we're going to try to incorporate more of Udell's ideas.  (See also the report <a href="http://207.22.26.166/GroupwareReport.html"><em>Internet Groupware for Scientific Collaboration</em></a> that Udell wrote almost a decade agoâ€”the more time goes by, the more prescient it seems.)
