On the one hand, I am disgusted by <a href="http://www.jennymccarthybodycount.com">people</a> who continue to claim that vaccines cause autism. On the other hand, given stories like <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/drug-firm-disguised-link-to-positive-journal-article-court-told-20090422-afhr.html">this one</a> about Merck trying to bury the impact of Vioxx on heart failure, it's no wonder that people don't trust scientists.  Because after all, "Merck" is a legal fiction: it was the people working there who decided that the truth was less important than the corporate bottom line.  Every time a doctor or scientist acts unethically, they make it harder for those who are being honest to be heard.
