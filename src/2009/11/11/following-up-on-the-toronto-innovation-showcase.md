My Government 2.0 class didn't meet this Monday, partly because I was on jury duty, and partly to give students a chance to catch up after last week's two-day showcase at City Hall. Two things I've been watching to fill the void are:
<ol>
  <li><a href="http://app.toronto.ca/tmmismonitor/index.do">City of Toronto Meeting Monitor</a>—scrolling lists of proposals, amendments, referrals, and what not. I'd love to see something like this for the University of Toronto…</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.datato.org/app/need/list">datato.org</a> (which got a <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/11/four-short-links-11-november-2.html">mention</a> at O'Reilly from Nat Torkington). Neat to see that so many people want the same things my students did; kind of sad that some of that data (like household energy consumption) isn't going to be available for a long time.</li>
</ol>
