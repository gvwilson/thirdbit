title: "Bend It 'Til It Breaks"

Want to know how strong a piece of steel is? Bend it 'til it breaks. Want to know how usable a programming system is? Make a few deliberate mistakes and see how comprehensible the error messages are. It's not the only approach, but it's the one <a href="http://zef.me/">Zef Hemel</a> took with Ruby on Rails. In his <a href="http://zef.me/2308/when-rails-fails">original post</a>, he took a critical look at how helpful Rails is when a developer mistypes something. A lot of people misunderstood what he was doing, which prompted a <a href="http://zef.me/2355/a-when-rails-fails-follow-up">follow-up post</a>; since then, he has tried the same approach with <a href="http://zef.me/2333/when-jboss-seam-fails">JBoss Seam</a> and <a href="http://zef.me/2371/when-scala-dsls-fail">Scala Lift</a>. I think this is pretty cool—so cool, in fact, that I'm wondering if there's a thesis topic in there somewhere…
