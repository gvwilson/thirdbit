I'm still not convinced that distributed version control is the future, mostly because I don't believe in <strong><em>the</em></strong> future: as always, there will be many mixed together, and since my focus is getting novice developers up the learning curve, I'm going to continue to rank initial ease of use over power in the hands of professionals.  That said, <a href="http://www.bugseverywhere.org/be/show/HomePage">Bugs Everywhere</a> looks pretty cool: it's a distributed bug tracking system that works with  Arch, Bazaar, <span class="caps">GIT</span>, Mercurial, and RCS. No master copy, just parallel universes that merge occasionallyâ€¦  Neat.

But once again it prompts me to ask: where are the computer scientists while all this is going on?  None of the systems I've mentioned in this post was created by a grad student as a research project, and I'm willing to bet that most profs in CS departments don't even know they exist. *sigh*
