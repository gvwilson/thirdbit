Via the <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2009/02/us_courts_get_tough_on_earth_l.html">Great Beyond</a>: "Marie Mason was sentenced last week to nearly 22 years in prison for a 1999 arsonâ€¦for conspiring to set fire to the Michigan State University campus offices of the Agriculture Biotechnology Support Project, which promoted the use of genetically-modified crops in the developing world. Because the arson of the was motivated by anti-genetic modification ideologies, the sentencing judge followed 'terrorism enhancement' guidelines to set the sentence."  Which makes me wonder: will today's militant greens one day be considered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Patriotic-Treason-John-Brown-America/dp/0803219466">premature heroes</a>, or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bringing-War-Home-Underground-Revolutionary/dp/0520241193">misguided extremists</a>?
