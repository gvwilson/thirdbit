Monday is my heavy teaching day: I have my third-year intro to software engineering 12-1, then two back-to-back sessions with the students in my consulting course.  It's a long haul, so I'm very grateful to David Crow (Microsoft), Daniel Debow (Rypple), and Rick Yazwinski (TUCOWS) for coming in this week for all three hours to talk about how to get hired, how <em>not</em> to, why persistence matters more than intelligence, why everyone who wants to be taken seriously should have a blog, and a whole lot more.  Their advice has already led to the creation of <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~famelis/planet/atom.xml">Planet DCS@UofT</a>—I look forward to having them back at the end of term to help judge students' final presentations.

So thanks, guys—much appreciated.
