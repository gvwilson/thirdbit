As far as I can tell from <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/">DBLP</a>, few if any of these 30 people publish in academic journals.  Putting it another way, almost nobody who publishes academic work on quality assurance is going to be teaching at this conference, which will probably have more practitioners in attendance than every QA-related academic conference this year. *sigh*
