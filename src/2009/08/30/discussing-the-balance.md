I accumulated a few links this summer about gender equity in computing, particularly in open source. The two that bear re-reading are:
<ol>
  <li>Robert Kaye <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/07/oscon-standing-out-in-the-crow.html">reports</a> on Kirrily Robert's OSCON keynote "<a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2009/public/schedule/detail/10173">Standing Out in the Crowd</a>". Five years after Michelle Levesque and I looked at gender ratios in open source, the average is still only 1.5% female (though some projects, like Drupal, have reached the same 15-20% as the industry as a whole). Most of the talk was upbeat, though, as some people <em>are</em> working hard to address the problem.</li>
  <li>Maggie Fox's "<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Howlett/?p=1172">Oi! Are we invisible or something?</a>" makes some of the same points, and offers a checklist of things conference organizers can do to help.</li>
</ol>
