MarkUs, a Rails-based tool for marking student programming assignments, just released <a href="http://blog.markusproject.org/?p=238">Version 0.5</a>. MarkUs aims to provide the convenience and flexibility of pen-and-paper marking over the web; it will be deployed this fall at the University of Toronto, and is one of the eight <a href="http://ucosp.wordpress.com">cross-country open source projects</a> we'll be working on starting inâ€”um, really? Just one week from now?

And speaking of the fall, Bill Konrad has posted some ideas about what's next for Basie. If you have preferences, we'd be grateful for your input.
