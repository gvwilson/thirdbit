From <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3582">Lambda the Ultimate</a>:
<blockquote>According to a <a href="http://scheme-reports.org/2009/position-statement.html">draft statement</a>, Scheme is to be split into a small and a large language, the small being designed for educators and "50-page purists", the large for "programmers, implementors".</blockquote>
Part of me says, "If you think purists and programmers belong in two different camps, you're doing more harm than good." The rest of me says, "Isn't it a shame that every useful programming language eventually has to make this distinction?"
