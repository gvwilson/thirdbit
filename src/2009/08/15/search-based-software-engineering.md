This <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=101301">paper</a> from Microsoft Research is yet another sign that intelligent after-the-fact search is becoming more important in software engineering:
<blockquote>

This paper presents the design, implementation and experience from such a search tool called DebugAdvisor…The context of a bug includes all the information a programmer has about the bug, including natural language text, textual rendering of core dumps, debugger output etc…Our key insight is to allow the programmer to collate this entire context as a query to search for related information. Thus, DebugAdvisor allows the programmer to search using a fat query, which could be kilobytes of structured and unstructured data describing the contextual information for the current bug.</blockquote>
