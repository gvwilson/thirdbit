From <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3529">Lambda the Ultimate</a> to <a href="http://wadler.blogspot.com/2009/07/evaluation-and-usability-of-programming.html">Phil Wadler's blog</a> to a link that was working yesterday, but is 404'ing this morning: a workshop on <a href="http://ecs.victoria.ac.nz/Events/PLATEAU/WebHome">evaluation and usability of programming languages and tools</a>, to be held at OOPSLA in late October. Scope includes:
<ul>
  <li>empirical studies of programming languages</li>
  <li>methodologies and philosophies behind language and tool evaluation</li>
  <li>software design metrics and their relations to the underlying language</li>
  <li>user studies of language features and software engineering tools</li>
  <li>visual techniques for understanding programming languages</li>
  <li>critical comparisons of programming paradigms, such as object-oriented vs. functional</li>
  <li>tools to support evaluating programming languages</li>
</ul>
Long overdue, and very welcome.
