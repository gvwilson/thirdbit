title: "Different Weights, Different Answers"

In my experience, people often come to different conclusions not because they disagree on fundamentals, but because they weight the factors in play differently. <a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2009/08/28/la-plus-ca-change-its-the-goals-not-the-data/">Mark Guzdial's recent post</a> about instructors backing away from his media-based approach to teaching computing is a case in point: as he says, "None of the teachers I have heard from are saying that <a href="http://coweb.cc.gatech.edu/mediaComp-teach/12">our studies are wrong</a>. Media Computation, across multiple schools, does lead to improved success rates and broader participation in computingâ€”women and members of under-represented groups succeed as well as white or Asian males.  These teachers are simply deciding that success rates and broadening participation is <em>not</em> their<em> most important </em>priority." Well worth reading, particularly if you're new to teaching.
