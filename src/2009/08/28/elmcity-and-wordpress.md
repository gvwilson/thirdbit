I had a good discussion yesterday with Jon Udell about goals for <a href="http://ucosp.wordpress.com/project-elmcity/">the students working with him this fall</a>. He has since posted two very cool things:
<ol>
  <li><a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2009/08/27/friendfeed-for-project-collaboration/">Using FriendFeed to manage a loosely-coupled team</a>. Jon admits he's an outlier, but I expect I'm going to learn a lot watching him work with his team this way. It's also going to push integration between Basie and other services higher up the to-do list.</li>
  <li>A lengthy description of <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2009/08/15/elmcity-and-wordpress-mu-questions-and-answers/">how to make elmcity and WordPress play nicely together</a>.  A calendar aggregator plugin for WordPress would be very cool (think about a City of Toronto blog that aggregated and displayed events harvested from neighborhood-level blogs), but Jon's description of how it works is a good intro to elmcity for would-be curators.</li>
</ol>
