There was a box waiting for me in the mailroom today.  "Oh," I thought, "That was quick—Amazon usually takes at least a week."  But it wasn't Amazon—no, it was my first five copies of <em>Practical Programming</em>, each in its own individual bubblewrap sleeve.  W00t!  And woo hoo!  And don't you <em>dare</em> say "errata" or "second edition", at least not yet—I have a moment I'd like to savor.

Thanks again to Jennifer, Paul, and Jason (co-authors) and to Dan Steinberg at Pragmatic—yay!
