The aphorism in the title is taken from the introduction to Richard Sennett's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Craftsman-Prof-Richard-Sennett/dp/0300119097"><em>The Craftsman</em></a>.  Later, he says:
<blockquote>Modern education fears repetitive learning as mind-numbing. Afraid of boring children, avid to present ever-different stimulation, the enlightened teacher may avoid routine—but thus deprives children of the experience of studying their own ingrained practice and modulating it from within… Skill development depends on how repetition is organized… As skill expands, the capacity to sustain repetition increases…</blockquote>
How does this apply to programming?  How <em>should</em> it apply?
