As one term ends, so another begins, and we're very excited to have another good team of summer interns this year:
<ul>
  <li>Mike Conley, Severin Gehwolf, Amanda Manarin, and Nelle Varoquaux are working on OLM for Karen Reid</li>
  <li>Ainsley Lawson, Samar Sabie, Sarah Strong, and Maria Yancheva are doing climate change projects for Steve Easterbrook</li>
  <li>Eran Henig, Bill Konrad, Phyliss Lee, and Florian Shkurti are working on the Django-based rewrite of DrProject for me, with Ashwin Bhat, Leigh Honeywell, and a few others helping out</li>
  <li>Blaise Alleyne is doing a Google Summer of Code project with Drupal</li>
</ul>
We're kicking things off on Monday the 11thâ€”stay tuned for progress reports.
