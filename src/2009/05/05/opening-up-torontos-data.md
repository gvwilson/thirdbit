A month ago, Mayor David Miller <a href="http://visiblegovernment.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=86&amp;Itemid=29">announced</a> Toronto's plan to open up its data to its citizens (and the rest of the world).  Over on his blog, David Crow is now musing about ways to <a href="http://davidcrow.ca/toronto/7154/whats-your-open-data-idea">inspire the community to build</a> applications, services, and business on top of that data.  My plan is to run my consulting course in the fall term (September to December), and give the grad and undergrad students who take it credit for leveraging whatever information they can in some useful way.  We'll have a better idea in July or August of exactly what's going to be available; hope you'll all chime in with suggestions for things the students could do.
