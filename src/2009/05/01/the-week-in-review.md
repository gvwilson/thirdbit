title: "The Week in Review"

Things I did this week that I was supposed to:
<ol>
  <li>Give a talk at the NRC on empirical software engineering and computational science.</li>
  <li>Submit grades for this term's courses.</li>
  <li>File my income tax return.</li>
</ol>
Things I didn't do that I really needed to:
<ol>
  <li>File an expense claim.</li>
  <li>Start article for <a href="http://www.amsci.org"><em>American Scientist</em></a>.</li>
  <li>Revise at least one lecture for Software Carpentry.</li>
  <li>Send papers for the <a href="http://cise.aip.org/"><em>CiSE</em></a> special issue on software engineering for computational science out for review.</li>
  <li>Send out a follow-up to the survey of how scientists use computers.</li>
</ol>
Things I hadn't planned to do that were worth doing:
<ol>
  <li>Write a handful of blog posts about things that matter to me.  (Did lots of email in the background about women in open source as well.)</li>
</ol>
Things that I did that I really shouldn't have wasted time on:
<ol>
  <li>A cold.</li>
  <li>Quake Live ("Rail gun naaaation, oh yeah, rail gun nation…")</li>
  <li>Twitter.</li>
</ol>
Here's hoping next week will be more productive…
