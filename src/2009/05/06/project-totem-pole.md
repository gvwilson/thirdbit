Inspired by Michael Ogawa's <a href="http://vis.cs.ucdavis.edu/~ogawa/codeswarm/">Code Swarm</a>, an ex-student named David Scannell who did a lot of work on DrProject has created <a href="http://www.david.scannell.ca/blog/?p=50">Totem Pole</a>,  a simple visualization of who's been contributing to a project how recently.  Neat!
