A couple of people have asked whether <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/gwpy/practical-programming"><em>Practical Programming</em></a> is suitable for high school students. The answer is yes, particularly if they're interested in science as well as programming. And of course, the <a href="http://www.wingware.com/downloads/wingide-101">Wing 101 IDE</a> we recommend is free.
