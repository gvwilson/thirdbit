The only downside of last week's <a href="http://stackoverflow.carsonified.com/events/toronto/">DevDays</a> in Toronto was the more-abysmal-than-usual gender ratio: it was at least 100:1, and may well have been worse. So, if you're organizing a tech event of any kind, check out <a href="http://geekspeakr.com/">geekspeakr.com</a>—it's a new directory of women in tech who can speak on topics ranging from Android programming to… um… something techy that starts with 'Z'.  (Forgive me, I have a cold…)
