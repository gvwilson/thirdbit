Via the CBC: Toronto will <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2009/10/19/apartments-waste-diversion394.html">miss its target for reducing landfill waste</a> because only 15% (!!) of apartment and condo buildings have green bins. 15% sounds pitiful, but one reason the figure is so low is that the drop in city revenues over the last 12 months has meant cutbacks in the green bin program. I wonder if this would be moving ahead faster if the city's web site had a dashboard that included week-by-week stats?
