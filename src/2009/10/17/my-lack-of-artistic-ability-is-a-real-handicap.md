Via several routes, I found the <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn you a Haskell for Greater Good</a> tutorial (yes, that's really its name). The humor is occasionally a bit forced, but it's pretty good, and the author's hand-drawn cartoons add a lot to it. I wish I was that talented: I hired an architecture student to do the diagrams for the Software Carpentry course, and "let" <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~jmontojo/">Jason Montojo</a> do the illustrations for <a href="http://assets2.pragprog.com/titles/gwpy/practical-programming"><em>Practical Programming</em></a>, but wished both times that I could do the work myself. Kudos to LHGG's author for a job well done.
