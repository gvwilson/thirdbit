  <li>The cross-country capstone projects are going well—most recently, one of the students has asked why students who can't go five minutes without tweeting or updating their Facebook status <a href="http://ucosp.wordpress.com/2009/10/13/talkin-bout-my-generation/">fall silent</a> when asked to communicate with one another in a course. It's puzzling; comments on the post would be very welcome.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile, the Eclipse4Edu team is running an online survey to find out more about <a href="http://deugo.carleton.ca/esurvey/participationPostSurvey.action?id=4028804a240b4a2d0124546410a20004&amp;password=">how students use IDEs</a>.</li>
  <li>And I've updated my plans for <a href="http://softwarecarpentry.wordpress.com/a-fresh-start/">redesigning the Software Carpentry course</a>, and would appreciate feedback (particularly from anyone familiar with Wiggins &amp; McTighe's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Design-Expanded-Grant-Wiggins/dp/0131950843"><em>Understanding by Design</em></a>). I'd also appreciate pointers to anyone who might fund it…</li>
