It's taken a little longer than planned, but what doesn't? Here are the projects the students in our Government 2.0 consulting course have chosen to work on this term:
<ul>
  <li>SMS for managing queues at government officesâ€”give it your cell phone number, and it'll text you as your turn to be served comes up.</li>
  <li>A "where should I live?" tool that scores potential homes by what's within walking distance.</li>
  <li>Privacy auditing for a medical records management tool used at homeless shelters.</li>
  <li>Dredging the web to find farmers' markets and independents selling fresh produce in the greenbelt.</li>
  <li>Visualizing traffic accident data.</li>
  <li>Crowdsourcing translation of city information pamphlets and other small documents.</li>
  <li>Comparing individual homes' energy consumption with neighborhood averages.</li>
</ul>
Our next deadline is November 2, when students will be presenting their ideas at the City of Toronto Innovation Showcase.
