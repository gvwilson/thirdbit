All of the students in my consulting course now have projects; most have met their customers and/or have some real data to play with.  Lots of other news too:
<ul>
  <li>The City of Toronto is holding an <a href="http://remarkk.com/2009/10/09/call-to-action-join-the-toronto-open-data-community/">Innovations Showcase</a> on Nov 2-3 to brainstorm Gov 2.0 ideas.  Online registration should open this coming Monday (Oct 19); hope to see you there.</li>
  <li><a href="http://seeclickfix.blogspot.com/2009/10/25000-towns-just-launched-on.html">SeeClickFix</a> have loaded 25,000 town boundaries into their database.</li>
  <li>There's a <a href="http://www.gov2expo.com/gov2expo2010">Gov 2.0 Expo</a> in Washington DC in Mayâ€”it'd be cool to see some of our projects there.</li>
  <li>Good story in the Guardian about <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/oct/14/san-francisco-open-city-data">Gov 2.0 success in San Francisco</a>.</li>
  <li>Not quite Gov 2.0, but worthwhile: <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/10/random-hacks-of-kindness-disas.html">Random Hacks of Kindness</a> is getting open source developers to work on projects for disaster relief.</li>
</ul>
Finally, I'd like to thank everyone from the city and other organizations who has given us so much of their time: it's been wonderful how many of you have been willing to help us out, and we're very grateful.
