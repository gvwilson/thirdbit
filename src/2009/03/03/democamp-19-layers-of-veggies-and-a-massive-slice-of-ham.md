I had to cut out of <a href="http://democamp.com/2009/02/24/dct19-schedule/">DemoCamp 19</a> early tonight to put my daughter to bed, but Mike Conley (a U of T student and first-time attendee) <a href="http://mikeconley.ca/blog/2009/03/03/democamp-march-3rd-2009/comment-page-1/">blogged the demos and presentations</a> in real time.  I'm glad I got to see some regulars, and meet some new people; very sorry to have missed Leigh Honeywell's talk about the <a href="http://hacklab.to/">Toronto Hacklab</a>.
