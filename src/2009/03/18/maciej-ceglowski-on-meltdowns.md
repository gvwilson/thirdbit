<a href="http://idlewords.com/2009/03/cowpox_smallpox.htm">Well-written article</a> from Maciej Cegłowski about financial and climatic meltdowns, and the inability of mass-media democracies to think sensibly about long-term issues.  It prompted an interesting exchange today:

Me: Any plan to deal with global climate change that's based on a fundamental change in human nature is going to fail.

Him: You would have said that about slavery in 1800.
