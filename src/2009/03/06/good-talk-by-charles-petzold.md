My thanks again to Charles Petzold for speaking at U of T last nightâ€”there were about 60 people in the audience to share his stroll through Calvinist theology, the history of computing, and the life and work of Alan Turing.  A <a href="http://podcasts.ischool.utoronto.ca/?p=97">podcast</a> is available via U of T's iSchool, and I hope to have photos up some time soon.
