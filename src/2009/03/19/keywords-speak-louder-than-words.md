Mozilla is taking education pretty seriously these days (see previous posts). The latest news from David Humphrey is a brand new Bugzilla keyword for tagging tickets: <a href="http://vocamus.net/dave/?p=408"><strong>student-project</strong></a>. This tag will help students find things to work on; as he says, good candidates are:
<ul>
  <li>not in the critical path of a release</li>
  <li>not so far from a release that they have no chance of getting review or attention from the community.</li>
  <li>things [developers] would do if [they] had time, which probably means [they] care about them happening, know they could be done, etc.</li>
  <li>scoped for academic time frames.</li>
  <li>things [developers] know the community will be willing to help mentor.</li>
</ul>
Here's hoping other organizations pick this up (and not just during GSoC).
