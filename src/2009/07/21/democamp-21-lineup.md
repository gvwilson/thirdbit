<ul>
  <li><strong>You can't pick your neighbours, but you can pick your neighbourhood!</strong>. <em>Saul Colt, <a href="http://zoocasa.com/">Zoocasa</a>. </em>Zoocasa is a new way to search  for homes in Canada.

  <li><strong>Bringing Social Media to Contractors. </strong><em>Brian Sharwood, <a href="http://homestars.com/">HomeStars</a></em>. HomeStars is a social media website for contractors.  It's how they communicate with their clients, generate reviews, generate leads, and create 'whuffie'.  Home improvement guys (and gals) are not particularly tech savvy. We provide a platform for them to communicate with their  clients, who provide them feedback and reviews.</li>
  <li><strong>Create a BlackBerry/iPhone Mobile App in 5 Minutes. </strong><em>Alan Lysne, </em><a href="http://www.cascadamobile.com/products/breeze.php"><em>Cascada Mobile</em></a>.

We have raised $ 1.6 million in angel funding, and are ready to launch our product.</li>
  <li><strong>WeGoWeGo.com: semantic search for city events. </strong><em>Dan Wood, </em><a href="http://wegowego.com/"><em>WeGoWeGo.com</em></a>.

  <li><strong>Guestlist - online event management. </strong>Ben Vinegar, <a href="http://guestlistapp.com/">Guestlist</a>. Guestlist is an online event management application, with a focus on user experience, design, and simplicity. It lets event organizers sell tickets online via gorgeous looking event pages, which are built using an intuitive  WYSIWYG editor. Guestlist is "getting real" applied to event managementâ€”we've built a simple solution by providing what 80% of event organizers need, and forgetting the rest. (Note: Ben is a former UT undergrad.)</li>
