A decade ago, people like Jon Udell were imagining how the web could radically change the way science is done. Today, those visions are becoming a reality, and on July 29, you can join us for an afternoon of talks about what's happening and how it could touch your life. Full details are at http://softwarecarpentry.wordpress.com/guests/â€”the event is free, but you must register in advance (as there is limited seating). Our speakers will include:
<ul>
