As I mentioned a few weeks ago, I'm teaching the second course in our two-course sequence on software engineering next term (i.e., in three and a half weeks). The goal of the course is to teach students how to deal with large pre-existing code bases; my first thought was to have each team go spelunking in a different open source project, but (a) I haven't been able to find enough that meet my criteria, and (b) marking would be very difficult. I'm therefore looking at:
<ol>
  <li>Building a connector so that <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/gnumeric/">Gnumeric</a> or <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/product/calc.html">OpenOffice Calc</a> can be used as a front-end to <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>.</li>
  <li>Help out with <a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite/">SpatiaLite</a>, a set of geospatial extensions to <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>.</li>
  <li>Help out with <a href="http://www.logilab.org/857">PyLint</a>, a static analysis tool for <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://adam.goucher.ca/?p=1324">Refactor the Selenium IDE</a> to make it more pluginnable.</li>
</ol>
I was hoping to find something that would tie in to this term's Open Government projects with the <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/open/">City of Toronto</a> (it seems a shame to lose the momentum), but I haven't found anything yet that doesn't require more web programming background than it's fair to assume—roughly 1/3 of the students in the course haven't done CSC309 (our web programming course), and while many are taking it concurrently with CSC302, it wouldn't make for a level playing field.
