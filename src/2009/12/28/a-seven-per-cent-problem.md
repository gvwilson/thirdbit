Best Colleges Online (about which I know nothing) has posted a list of <a href="http://www.bestcollegesonline.com/blog/2009/06/18/100-incredible-lectures-from-the-worlds-top-scientists/">100 great science talks</a> that you can watch for free on the web.  By my count, only 7 have a computing component, and of those, only 2 are actually about computer science per se.  As I've said before and elsewhere, we desperately need a Sagan or Attenborough.
