title: "Cross-Country Project Wrapup"

45 students from 14 universities, 8 projects—it's been quite a term for the <a href="http://ucosp.wordpress.com">cross-country capstone projects</a>. There were some bumps in the road, but overall, we think it went well. If you'd like to see what the students accomplished, check out their <a href="http://ucosp.wordpress.com/category/screencast/">screencasts</a>; if you'd like to join us next term, please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">get in touch</a>; and if you'd like to talk about scaling the program up, please stay tuned—I'm hoping to organize a BoF at <a href="http://www.sigcse.org/sigcse2010/">SIGCSE'10</a> in Milwaukee. (And p.s.: you can see screencasts of projects in my Government 2.0 course as well.)
