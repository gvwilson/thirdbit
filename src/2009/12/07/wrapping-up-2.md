On the same day that the <em>New York Times</em> ran an article about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/07/technology/internet/07cities.html">open data and Government 2.0</a>, the graduate and undergraduate students in this term's consulting course did their final presentations. On deck were:
<ol>
  <li><a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~dtarlow/xtagg_screencast.m4v"><em>Managing Twitter Conversations</em></a>: Tyler Lu, Kevin Regan, Jasper Snoek, and Danny Tarlow</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~mccrae/2125project/"><em>Finding the Best Place to Live</em></a>: Andrew Borzenko, Abayomi King, and James McCrae</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~shobhit/CSC2125/index.html"><em>Who Has Seen My Data?</em></a> Fan Dong, Lenny Han, Benton Hui, and Shobhit Jain</li>
  <li><em>Connecting With the Greenbelt</em>: Michael Gorecki, Jory Graham, Mohit Jain, and Frank Li</li>
  <li><em>Visualizing Traffic Accident Data</em>: David Nowak, Alyssa Rosenzweig, and Samar Sabie</li>

</ol>
About 25 visitors joined us from the city, local companies, and elsewhere for an hour and a half of demonstrations and discussion. The students did well; they're a credit to the university, and I hope they're as proud of their work as I am.
