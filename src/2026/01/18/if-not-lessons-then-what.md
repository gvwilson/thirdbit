title: If Not Lessons, Then What?

I used to think that when I retired,
I would spend my time writing short tutorials on topics I was interested in
as a way to learn more about them myself.
I've now been unemployed for three months,
and while I've written some odds and ends,
it's not nearly as fulfilling as I expected
because I *know* that
most people aren't going to read a three-thousand word exposition of discrete event simulation:
they're going to ask an LLM,
and get something pseudo-personalized in return.

To be clear,
I don't think this is inherently a bad thing:
ChatGPT and Claude have helped me build <https://github.com/gvwilson/asimpy>
and fix bugs in <https://github.com/gvwilson/sim>,
and I believe I've learned more, and more quickly, from interacting with them than I would on my own.
But they do make me feel a bit like a typesetter
who suddenly finds the world is full of laser printers and WYSIWYG authoring tools.

I believe I can write a better explanation than an LLM,
but (a) I can only write one,
not a dozen or a hundred with slight variations to address specific learners' questions or desires,
and (b) it takes me days to do somewhat better what an LLM can do in minutes.
I believe I go off the rails less often than an LLM
(though some of my former learners may disagree),
but is what I produce better *enough*
to outweigh the speed and personalization that LLMs offer?
If not, what do I do instead?
