It has been 104 days since I was laid off.
In that time I have written approximately 64,000 words,
of which 75% has been fiction and 25% non-fiction.
(These figures don't include email or social media.)
I've actually written on all but 30 of those 104 days;
at 71%, that puts me a little short of my 75% target
but slightly ahead of the 65% of days I've managed over the past year.

As for time,
I'm averaging about 5 hours a day of trackable activity,
which includes exercise, music practice, and pro bono work
as well as writing, programming, teaching, and looking for a job.
I don't really know where the rest of the day goes—I don't believe sleep,
chores, Wordle, and an episode or two of [*Elementary*][elementary]
fill nineteen hours out of every twenty-four—but
I'm trying not to worry about it.

Ongoing projects include:

-   building some [simulations of software development teams][sim]
    in order to learn how [SimPy][simpy] works;
-   writing [a discrete event simulation package][asimpy] in Python that uses `async`/`await`
    (partly to teach  myself how asynchronous programming works in Python);
-   writing [a synthetic data generator][snailz] to use in teaching data science;
-   finishing two middle-grade novelettes and starting a third;
-   (finally) finishing a full draft of a YA novel I've been chipping away at for years;
-   doing a few hours of contract work (mostly teaching, but also some technical writing);
-   helping to supervise some university students' projects;
-   playing jazz again after more than twenty years; and
-   missing my daughter, who is enjoying her first year at university
    but without whom my world feels just a little bit empty.

One thing I *haven't* done much of is read.
I used to devour a book or two a week,
but these days I find it difficult to get into most fiction,
and even harder to read non-fiction.
I don't know if this is because I'm distracted by personal and world events,
or whether it's a stage of life,
but I miss losing myself in someone else's prose for a few hours at a time.
