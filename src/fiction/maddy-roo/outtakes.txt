Maddy had once heard her father say that the mayor was a *very* alpha female,
and while some townspeople might grumble that
it was time someone with hooves or scales had a turn running things,
everyone expected that the mayor would still be occupying that house
long after all of her fur had finished turning gray.

The mayor insisted she wasn't going deaf,
but would allow to friends that she was grateful when people didn't mumble.
