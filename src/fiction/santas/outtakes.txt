## The Smell of Fresh-Cut Wood

A few minutes and a few hundred words later,
Finner let his breath out in a slow whoosh.
"I actually did wonder about that," he said,
picking up the cup of tea that the Elfabot had poured for him
and immediately forgetting it was in his hand.

Santa Hotep cocked its head to one side.
"Really?"

Finner nodded.
"It was the wood.
It smelled like it had just been cut.
And you said everyone else had left a long time ago,
so I figured you might have been doing the work yourself."
He shrugged,
suddenly embarrassed.

"I didn't…
mean to,"
Hotep said.
"Not at…
the start.
But my elves…
were gone.
I could…
have asked…
for help…
but I…
discovered that…
I rather enjoyed…
the work.
Of course…
I couldn't tell…
Miz Tumbly."

"I guess not."
Finner swallowed hard,
not wanting to ask his next question but knowing that he had to.
"How is Shady Ann?"

"Dead!"
the Elfabot answered brightly.
"It was difficult to process at first.
I considered shutting down,
but decided to continue making deliveries instead.
I think it is what she would have wanted."

"I'm sorry,"
Finner said,
wishing it didn't sound so inadequate.

"Don't be."
Captain Abacus raised her tea in salute.
"She made the worlds a better place for a lot of people,
and most of us don't get to say that.
It's just a shame she never got to clear the air with Tumbly."

"I don't think she would have enjoyed that conversation,"
Finner said bitterly.
"Gran-Granna isn't very good at listening to things she doesn't want to hear."

"Now, now…"
Santa Hotep wheezed.
"She does…
care…
for you…
you know."

"No she doesn't,"
Finner replied.
"She cares about who she thinks I'm supposed to be.
If she cared about *me*,
she wouldn't have dumped me in The Building and replaced me with a robot."

Captain Abacus cleared her throat.
"Speaking of robots,
I don't suppose she gave you any idea of who's making them?"

Finner blinked.
"It's not you?
I mean,
I saw all those parts on your airship."

The muffled bells on Captain Abacus's hat clunked faintly
as she shook her head.
"That was plunder from the ship before Clausbeard's.
They didn't know where it was bound—all they knew was where to pick up and where to drop off.
Rule number one of the Smuggler's Code,"
she added.
"Don't ask questions."[^smugglers-code]

[^smugglers-code]: Rule number two is, "Unless you want to."

Finner nodded.
At that moment he wanted nothing more than
to peel off his filthy clothing,
take a hot shower,
and sleep for a week or the rest of his life,
whichever came first.
He was about to ask whether there actually *was* a shower or tub in the pyramid
when the magic mirror beside Santa Hotep chimed and rippled
to show the steps leading up to the pyramid entrance.
Instead of stone cats fighting unknown hooded figures,
though,
it revealed several very known figures:
Gran-Granna Tumbly,
Santa Hood,
and half a dozen santas wearing the same camouflage suits
as the ones who had been at The Building.
Two elves were with them as well—at least,
Finner assumed they were elves
from the amount of equipment they were carrying.

"That was quick,"
Captain Abacus muttered.

"Too bad…
I haven't…
had time…
to conjure up…
more cats,"
Santa Hotep said.
"I don't suppose…
your crew…
can help?"

Captain Abacus scowled.
"It'll take me a couple of wherevers to get there and a couple more to get back.
I don't think we have that much time."

"I could assist,"
the Elfabot volunteered.
It did something complicated with its arms.[^complicated-arms]

[^complicated-arms]: Books are very good at describing things, but even with diagrams, it would take several paragraphs to capture the way bits of metal plating pivoted out of the way and/or folded up to allow other, more dangerous bits of metal to take their place.

"Whoa,"
Finner breathed.
The robot's right arm now ended in a large ray gun,
while the left was some sort of curved shield.
"Did Shady Ann make those for you?"

"No."
The Elfabot hesitated.
"I—strange.
I don't know who did."
Its eyes flashed rapidly.
"Shall we see how well they work?"

"You stay here and watch over the boy,"
Captain Abacus ordered,
standing and straightening her coat.
"We'll see if we can sort this out.
After you?"
She gestured toward the exit.
Santa Hotep dipped his head and shuffled off with her at his side.

Finner watched through the mirror
as Gran-Granna Tumbly's elves unpacked the equipment they had brought
and assembled it into objects with unknown but undoubtedly lethal effect.
"We can't just stay here,"
he said.

"On the contrary,"
the Elfabot purred.
"That is *exactly* what we are going to do.
After all,
why fight them when we can get them can fight each other?"

It took a moment for the words and the change in the robot's voice to register.
Finner straightened up and turned to face it.
Its eyes weren't glowing red,
but somehow it suddenly seemed menacing instead of childlike.
"Um,
shouldn't we be trying to get them to not fight at all?"

"Oh, where would be the fun in that?
Besides,
they deserve it.
They deserve to be miserable."
The Elfabot sat on the couch where Captain Abacus had been and crossed its legs,
which was somehow more frightening than its oversized ray gun.

*Stay calm,* Finner told himself.
*Keep it talking.*
"You're not actually Shady Ann's bot, are you?"

The robot shrugged.
"I was.
Or rather, *this* was."
Its gesture took in its whole body.
"Consider me an upgrade.
Or no,
a backup that has been restored.
My name is Ooph,
and I've been waiting for this day for a long, long time."

"Ooph?
Like,
their elf Ooph?"

"I was never *theirs*!" the robot snapped.
"I was *hers*,
and we were happy together until Tumbly came along.
After that,
Shady Ann couldn't even see me.
It was all Tumbly this and Tumbly that and fighting for the cause.
I tried to help her—to help them both—but you've seen the picture, haven't you?
The two of them together and me off on the side?
And the statue that's just them?
Pfah!"

"So all of this—replacing people with robots—that's you?"

"That part,"
Ooph admitted.
"But Tumbly's fanaticism?
And Abacus and the others responding in kind?
I'm just showing them who they really are."

Finner stepped back as the robot stood in one smooth motion.
"And now, thanks to you, I have them all in one place.
It's time for the main event.
Look."

It gestured at the mirror.
The scene zoomed out to show Santa Hotep and Captain Abacus standing in the pyramid's entrance.
The captain had her cutlass in her hand,
and something green glowing and flickered around the mummy's hands.
Gran-Granna Tumbly and Santa Hood faced them from the bottom of the steps
with the other santas and the two elves in a half-circle behind them.
Finner couldn't hear what they were saying,
but from their angry gestures it was clear that the conversation wasn't going well.

"And three…
And two…
And *one*,"
Ooph said.
Right on cue the sand dunes folded themselves inside out,
leaving a dozen figures standing behind Gran-Granna Tumbly's forces.

Finner's heart sank.
The new arrivals were copies of Gran-Granna, Santa Hood, and the rest of her team.

"Do you see now?"
Ooph hissed.

"Uh huh."
Finner nodded, then bolted for the exit.

"Wait!" he shouted as he pelted down the stone corridor.
"It's a trick!"
But up ahead he could already hear the sound of ray guns firing
and swords ringing against swords.
