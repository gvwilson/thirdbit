Making Shady Ann the Subway Santa really allows the plot to unfurl. And expand, particularly emotionally. Shady Ann is in many ways the emotional centre of the book (Finner is the main character but emotionally a firecracker pinwheeling around in panic. Which is frankly to be expected, given what goes on). She ties the past to the present, regrets to atonement, ideas to action. Cause to effect, as well, her actions rippling out into and across worlds. 

She also creates space: a slight slowdown in the frantic forward momentum of the plot so Finner has room to breathe. And feel. And think. In fact, I think Finner could use a little more of that room to express (and hopefully process???) some of his other emotions. In the beginning third (or so), he's thrown from one dangerous situation to the next. That's good as far as action goes, but I feel the story would have more tensile strength if he also had a little space to... be afraid? Be conscious of being afraid, so that when he stops being so afraid it actually registers? I love the footnotes, really do, but they're not the spot for emotional development. Or at least, not all of it.

None of that has to be lengthy, just sentences here or there, to help him become the person he is at the end: with powerful and profound thoughts about how and why we imprison one another, and how we can free ourselves (and everyone else too).

The idea of Santasaurus as a misplaced delivery dino is frigging BRILLIANT! In a world where so much destruction was deliberate, Santasaurus is basically a pissed off and territorial pet trying to go home to a world that makes more sense. And Captain Abacus could use a little more contour and shading, to clarify the outline of her conflict with Tumbly. Again, doesn't need much.

I think you're almost there. A little more room for Finner's emotional/character development - small, like a slight stretch - and it'll sing.
