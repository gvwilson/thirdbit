*You probably think this is a Christmas story because of the santas,
but it's not:
it's about right and wrong and figuring out who you are.
There are many footnotes and explosions but only one kiss,
and if you need someone to hold your hand during the scary bits
you're out of luck.
I'm just a book, and we don't have hands.*

## We Meet Our Protagonist

Once upon a time,
a young santa named Finner lived in a world halfway between yours and mine.
He came from a long line of santas and elves:
his mother had built her first wind-up wombat
when she was not much bigger than a wombat herself,
while his father started helping with deliveries
as soon as he was reliably out of diapers.[^reliably]

[^reliably]: There's a story behind that word "reliably", but it's best told some other time.

Everyone could tell that Finner was a santa the moment he was born:
his tiny little beard was the cutest they'd ever seen.
And as he grew up,
he loved santafying—at least, he tried to.
After all,
who *wouldn't* enjoy slithering down a sooty chimney
or trying to land a sleigh on a yurt without leaving a single dent in its stiff felt roof?
But no matter what he did,
a small voice in Finner's head said, "Me.
I don't enjoy this.
Or rather, I do, but it's not enough."

What he *did* enjoy was going into the workshop and helping his mother.
The smell of solder,
the *shick shick* of freshly-sharpened scissors,
and the feeling of a dovetail joint fitting perfectly together
felt right in a way that
clambering up the icy concrete side of an apartment building never did.

His parents tolerated it at first.
"Good for him to know how things are made,"
they told each other.
After a while,
though,
they began hinting that maybe he should being ho-ho-ho'ing in the attic
rather than sewing or gluing.
And a while after that,
Finner could tell that the hints were about to become
a number three talk from his father,[^number-three-talk]
so he put the tools he had borrowed from his mother back in their boxes
and pretended his dreams weren't filled with sanding and polishing.

[^number-three-talk]: Direct eye contact, patient but serious voice, lots of awkward pauses on both sides, every other sentence starting, "Your mother and I think…"

Finner became more restless every day.
His mother suggested running up and down three flights of stairs over and over
to burn off some energy,
but it only made him sweaty.
He tried sitting cross-legged on the floor with his eyes closed
and humming softly to himself like the monks of Lotse Nuffin,[^lotse-nuffin]
but all he got was a cold bum.

[^lotse-nuffin]: The monks were his father's favorite clients. They wanted nothing, so every year that's what he took them, and they were always grateful.

There were other santas and elves in town he could have tried talking to:
aunts and uncles,
second cousins twice removed,
and a few who'd married into the trade.
But they were all related to him somehow,
which would have made the conversation awkward,
and as far as he knew they all believed what everyone else did:
elves made and santas delivered.
That's how it was,
that's how it had always been,
and that was how it was always going to be.

For a while he wondered if he was just lazy,
which was basically a synonym for "sinful",
so he tried a few experiments.
Working twice as hard made him even sweatier than running up and down stairs.
Working half as hard made his father ask if he was sick and his mother mutter about teenagers.
Neither made the yearning in his chest go away.
It grew and grew until finally,
desperately,
he realized there was only one thing left for him to do.
He would have to ask his great-grandmother for advice.

Gran-Granna Tumbly spent most of her time napping,
but she had been one of the greatest santas ever.
She had once delivered a chocolate orange cake to a trio of scientists in a submarine
*without using a submarine herself*,
and then delivered a baby on the way home.[^deliver-baby]

[^deliver-baby]: "Delivered" in the conventional sense of helping someone give birth rather than the postal sense used for packages. Elves did make dolls sometimes that were so lifelike normal people though they were real, and (whisper it) sometimes santas would deliver them in the dead of night when most people were sleeping and take a real child in exchange, but we're not at that part of the story yet.

Everyone was a little bit afraid of her,
except for the unfortunate few who had felt the full force of her disapproving glare:
they were a *lot* afraid.
But everyone also knew that she and her wife Shady Ann had fought long and hard
to get santas the right to marry other santas
and elves the right to marry other elves.
There was a statue in the town square of Gran-Granna Tumbly and Shady Ann holding hands at their wedding,
and Finner thought that if anyone would know what to do,
she would.

He waited until Tuesday afternoon before going to see her.
He knew the postman delivered her weekly order of chocolate on Tuesdays,
and hoped that would put her in a good mood.
"Or at least a less grumpy one,"
he thought as he trudged through the damp, clumpy snow that had fallen overnight.
The last time he had seen her had been the family gathering at Long Night the year before.
Finner's uncle had accidentally served Gran-Granna camomile tea instead of double-dark coffee,
and had squirmed for an hour as she drank it one slow, withering sip at a time.

The Tumbly house looked exactly like those on either side of it:
a front door with an evergreen wreath on it,
a large curtained window to one side,
and a pair of smaller windows with matching curtains on the floor above.
The downstairs window had a warm, welcoming glow,
and even from the street Finner could smell curry and freshly-baked bread.
The only notable thing was a statue of a cat sitting on an round pedestal
in the middle of the front yard,
its stone eyes fixed on a snow-filled bird bath.[^notable-yard]

[^notable-yard]: The houses on either side had a miniature Ferris wheel and a model locomotive in their front yards, though, so the statue wasn't really *that* notable.

Finner took a deep breath and knocked on the door.
When nothing happened he knocked again.
"So much for that," he said aloud,
secretly relieved.

"She just nipped out to get some broccoli,"
a voice rumbled behind him.
"If you don't mind waiting a moment…?"

Finner turned around slowly.
The stone cat had turned its head toward him,
but was still keeping one eye on the empty bird bath.
"I—sure," he said lamely,
then added, "Thank you,"
because a statue of a cat is still in some sense a cat,
and one of the first lessons a santa is taught is
to always be polite to cats.

"You're welcome," the cat rumbled,
and together they waited in silence.

They didn't have to wait long.
A tricycle taxi rolled to a gentle stop in front of the house.
The taxi pedaller climbed out of his seat,
stretched until his spine went *pop!*,
nodded at Finner (or more likely the cat),
then opened the cab door and helped Gran-Granna Tumbly down.
Pocketing the half-coins she handed him,
he climbed back onto his seat and pedalled away.

Finner belatedly remembered that he was an able-bodied youth
and Gran-Granna was neither.
"Can I carry that for you?" he asked,
hurrying back down the short walk to the gate.

Gran-Granna Tumbly looked at the broccoli in her hand and snorted.
"I think I can manage," she said.
"Did you catch anything?"

"Uh…" Finner started, confused by the question.

"No," the cat statue rumbled.
"But I remain hopeful."

"Hmph."
Finner stepped out of the way as Gran-Granna Tumbly walked briskly up the path,
the tip of her cane stabbing the snow on every second step.
"Well, since you're here, you might as well come in."

"Yes'm," Finner said obediently.
With one last glance at the motionless cat he followed her through the door
and into the rest of his life.

## Guests Arrive

Finner had never actually been in Gran-Granna's house before,
but he'd heard stories.
A richly-patterned carpet in the hall that looked like it might once have been able to fly: check.
A set of coathooks with gargoyle faces: check.
A sitting room filled with a riot of greenery
and a mis-matched pair of overstuffed chairs: check.
Crossed harpoons over the fireplace and dozens of framed pictures
of children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren,
neighbors, friends, enemies,[^enemies-dates]
and the grateful, if somewhat perplexed, crew of a submarine: check.
A photograph of two middle-aged women in red-and-white coats holding hands
that Finner realized must have been the inspiration for the statue of Gran-Granna Tumbly and her wife: check.

[^enemies-dates]: Some of which had dates and locations written on them in neat, smug lettering.

And there was a teapot—*the* teapot,
the one people spoke about in hushed voices.
It didn't look special,
but it was never empty and its contents were never cold.
Bitter,
sometimes,
if that's what was needed,
but never cold.

Finner waited for Gran-Granna to settle into a chair
before sitting nervously on the edge of the other one.
She spooned a bit of sugar into a green-and-white teacup,
glanced at him,
added a bit more,
and then poured slowly and carefully.
"You'll want to let that cool a bit," she advised,
filling the second cup for herself
and sitting back with it cradled in her hands.

"Thank you,"
Finner said,
not knowing what else to say.
What *was* he going to say?
"Nothing feels right," was awfully vague,
and, "What should I do with my life?" seemed awfully—

"The thing about being old," Gran-Granna said without any preamble,
"Is that people think it makes you wise."

The silence that followed was broken only by
the ticking of the burl clock in the kitchen.
"Doesn't it?" Finner asked.

"Not so far as I can tell,"
Gran-Granna sighed.
She sipped her tea,
eyes half-closed like a cat having its ears scratched.
"But it does give you a passel of stories to tell.
Take your Auncle Minglin, for example."
She gestured at a picture on the wall of someone Finner vaguely remembered
having spilled cranberry juice on a white tablecloth at some point.
"Kind heart,
and a beautiful singing voice,
but as clumsy as an ox on ice skates.
They could trip over a rock that was clear across the other side of the street."

"So no deliveries?"
Finner ventured.

"That's certainly the conclusion they reached.
And they were pretty down in the mouth about it,
let me tell you.
The world needs doctors and airship pilots and what-not,
but when you've been told your whole life that you're destined for something else,
well,
it's hard to change direction."

Finner turned his teacup around in his hands.
"So what happened to them?"

Gran-Granna smiled.
"They ran off and joined the opera.
Last I heard,
they were singing six shows a week with not an empty seat in the house."
She sipped her tea.
"The way I look at it,
they *did* become a santa.
They're delivering the gift of music night after night,
and that's no small thing."

"Which brings us to you," she continued,
bright eyes fixed on Finner,
who at that moment desperately regretted having come to see her
and wished he could be almost anywhere else in the world.[^geography-volcanoes]

[^geography-volcanoes]: "Almost", because he had taken geography in school and knew about volcanoes.

"M-me?" Finner stammered.

"Yes, you," Gran-Granna said impatiently.
"Your folks have been worried about you for a while now.
Oh, I know, you didn't think anyone had noticed,
but you've been mopey and anxious
and all the other things young people get carried away with these days,
only more so."

A clock chimed quietly in the kitchen next door.
Somewhere in the distance,
someone called for their children to come inside,
it was time for bed and their teeth weren't going to brush themselves.
"I just don't know what to do," Finner confessed,
angry at the tears that he was absolutely *not* going to cry.
"I like the ho-ho-ho'ing,
but deliveries are—"
He paused for breath.
"It's like everyone else is excited about it but I'm just watching myself do it,
you know?
Like this is someone else's life and I've just put it on like a sweater
except it doesn't quite fit
and no matter how many times I wash it,
it'll still smell a bit like whoever it really belongs to."

"Hmph,"
Gran-Granna Tumbly snorted.
"Fancy words like that,
maybe you ought to think about delivering stories.
There are such,"
she went on.
"Places where people don't hold much by material possessions,
there are santas who memorize stories and poems
to tell to folks on their birthdays and whenever."

Finner turned his teacup around in his hands again.
"Do they write the stories too?"

Gran-Granna Tumbly shook her head firmly.
"No, of course not.
That's making, and making is elves' work."
She caught his eyes with hers,
which were as clear as a deep mountain lake and only half a degree warmer.

*THUMP!*
He jumped as something heavy hit the floor in the room overhead.
"What was that?"

Gran-Granna picked up her cane and struggled to her feet.
"Dearie me, look at the time," she said briskly.
"I'm sure your folks will be wondering where you are.
You'd best be—"

*THUMP!* "Ow, get off me!" a female voice said peevishly.

Finner looked at the ceiling.
"I think someone's up there," he whispered loudly.

Gran-Granna rolled her eyes.
"Door," she said, pointing at it with her cane.
"You. Through it. Now."

"Vidancia! Vidancia, where are you?"
a second voice bellowed from above.

"Quiet!" the first voice said.

"Vidanci-ulp!"
Finner practically heard someone putting their hand over someone else's mouth.

He gestured weakly toward the front door.
"Well, um, I'll just—" he started.

Heavy boots thumped on carpeted steps
as the biggest, beardiest santa Finner had ever seen came downstairs
and wrapped his arms around Gran-Granna Tumbly
in a number three hug.[^number-three-hug]
To Finner's complete surprise the barded santa started crying.

[^number-three-hug]: Both arms, full wrap, strong squeeze for two or three heartbeats depending on how bad things are.

"Oh Vidancia," he sniffled.
"It all went wrong.
It all went *wrong*."

Gran-Granna Tumbly wriggled out of the beard and the hug.
"Get ahold of yourself,"
she ordered.
"What went wrong?"
Finner did a double take.
Was that an ax strapped to the first santa's back?
A really big ax that looked like it was designed for chopping off heads
rather than for turning logs into kindling?

"We were ambushed,"
said a second santa
who had come silently down the stairs behind the first one.
She was no taller than Finner,
but lean where the first santa was brawny,
and her uniform—Finner did a double take.
Her hood and sack were red and white,
but the rest was changing color to match the carpet on the stairs.

Gran-Granna Tumbly pulled a handkerchief out of her sleeve
and thrust it into the big santa's hand.
"By whom?
And what happened to your target?"

"I don't know who they were.
But the target got away."
The second santa sat down heavily on the stairs.

"You're hurt," Gran-Granna said accusingly.

The second santa waved her off.
"It's nothing.
Just some broken ribs.
And maybe an eardrum.
One of my presents went off a little early,"
she added with a wicked grin.

The burly santa wiped his eyes on a sleeve that Finner could have used as a sleeping bag.
"We were all set to make the grab, and then *bam*!"
He smacked a meaty fist into an equally meaty palm.
"There they were,
all over us.
I tried to fight 'em, Vidancia, I swear."
His lower lip trembled.

Gran-Granna tumbly pursed her lips.
"That's twice now,"
she said to the second santa,
who nodded and then winced
before turning her gaze on Finner.

Something very much like a mild electric shock ran down his spine
as her dark eyes locked with his.
"And who's this?" she asked.

Before anyone could answer there was another pair of thumps upstairs.
"Well," a voice buzzed a moment later.
"It's not exactly a palace, is it?"

The burly santa growled and pulled his ax off his back
with a complicated shrug.
The santa on the stairs struggled to her feet with a curse.
"Sorry, sensei.
The flips must have followed us through."

"So it appears,"
Gran-Granna Tumbly said grimly.
She twisted the head of her cane
and to Finner's absolute dumbfoundment[^dumbfoundment]
drew a slender silver rapier.
"Hold this," she ordered,
handing the bit that didn't have sharp edges to Finner,
and then everything went a little bit nuts.

[^dumbfoundment]: Yes, that really is a word.

## Mayhem and a Pyramid

The second santa pulled a grenade out of her sack,
drew the pin with her teeth,
and chucked it overhand up the stairs.
"Bang," she said calmly.
Sure enough,
a second later there was a loud *crack!*
and bilious green foam began expanding in the stairwell.

"That won't hold them for long,"
Gran-Granna Tumbly said,
twisting at the waist until her spine made a *crack*
that was only slightly quieter than the grenade's.

"Come on ya sock-chewin' deviants!" the big santa bellowed,
hefting his really quite large ax
as a UPOF[^upof] crashed through a window upstairs
and landed in the front yard with a wet *thud*.
Boots and broken glass clattered on the porch roof.
Moments later there were more thuds in the yard and a muttered,
"Ouch, Norman, watch where you're going."

[^upof]: Unidentified Piece of Furniture. It's like a flying saucer, except it's (usually) rectangular, doesn't fly (unless it's thrown very hard), and (normally) isn't of alien origin.

"That window *does* open," Gran-Granna Tumbly muttered.
Sparkles ran down the rapier in her hand.

"Is that a *magic* sword?" Finner breathed.

"Not magic enough," their great-grandmother snapped.
"You two! Get him out of here and keep him safe.
No, don't argue,"
she continued as the lean santa opened her mouth.
"You're in no shape for another fight.
And you!"
She jabbed a finger at Finner.
"You go with them and you do exactly what they say, understand?"

Finner didn't have a chance to ask, "Go where?"
because at precisely that moment something roared in the front yard,
making the kind of sound that bypasses the ears
and goes directly to the bit in the back of the brain
that evolved to keep a million generations of ancestors
out of the stomachs of large predators.

"What—" a voice in the front yard started but never managed to finish.
Someone else simply screamed, briefly.
A sound like a dozen empty cans being crunched together
was followed by a moment of stunned silence,
and then the shooting started.

The burly santa yanked Finner behind the blade of his enormous ax.
Bullets ricocheted off it to make lethal little holes in the pictures on the walls.
The other santa dove across the room to take shelter beside them.
Punctured in a dozen places,
the green foam in the stairs made a wet, farty noise
and began to deflate.

"Get! Out! Of! Here!" Gran-Granna Tumbly shouted.
Her sword flashed back and forth,
knocking bullets away from them.[^teapot-bullets]

[^teapot-bullets]: Or possibly from her teapot. Finner wondered about that later.

Suddenly Gran-Granna's fireplace was gone,
or rather it was still there but it was also a doorway,
like one of those puzzle pictures that looks like two different things at once.
The big santa picked Finner up like a sack of laundry
and crossed the room with two enormous strides.
Something twisted and everything stretched around them
or possibly they did the stretching
and just like that they were somewhere else.

It was bright.
Very bright,
where before it had been the cozy indoor gloom of an elderly person's living room.
And there was sand, comma, lots of.
*And that looks like a pyramid,*
a small part of Finner's brain noticed,
a pyramid with half a dozen cat statues like the one in gran-granna's yard
crouched in front of it.

The second santa got to her feet and brushed sand off her uniform,
which was already turning a dusty beige.
"Where are we?" she asked.

It took Finner a moment to realize she was speaking to him.
"I don't know," he said helplessly.
It was hot,
much too hot for the winter coat he was wearing.
And where was Gran-Granna?

The santa stared at him.
"What do you mean—" she started,
only to be interrupted by a voice moaning,
"Greeeetinnngs…"

Finner spun around and found himself face-to-face with—he wasn't quite sure what.
It was tall and withered
and wrapped in tattered bandages
made from the rags of what might once have been a santa's uniform.
Its eyes didn't quite line up,
and—was that a *bone* of the end of one of its arms
where there really ought to be a hand?[^mechanical-hand]

[^mechanical-hand]: Even a mechanical hand would have been okay. Finner had an aunt who had started wearing one after an encounter with a particularly militant guard goose, and more than a few of his mother's elvish friends had needed mechanical upgrades after what people referred to as "workshop incidents".

The burly santa hefted his ax.
"Friend or foe?" he demanded.

The mummy santa smiled, or more accurately bared its large, yellow teeth.
"That depends on…
whether you brought…
tea.
And treats…
for my pets."
At the word "treats",
one of the giant cat statues at the base of the pyramid
turned its head and blinked,
which made the "stay out of predators" part of Finner's brain go *ding ding ding!*

"Tea?" the burly santa asked,
clearly never having had this particular response to his friend-or-foe question before.

"Miz Tumbly…
always…
brings tea.
And sometimes…
a magazine?"
the mummy santa finished hopefully.

"No magazines, I'm afraid, and no tea either,"
the lean santa said,
her uniform now a perfect match for the sand.
"We had to leave Sensei Tumbly's in rather a hurry."

"Ssss…"
The mummy hissed with disappointment.
"I suppose…
you're going…
to claim…
refuge?"

The lean santa elbowed her burly companion's ribs to stop him from speaking.
"As is our right," she said.
"A cookie, a glass of milk, and the use of your wherever."

"Heh.
Heh.
Heh."
The mummy said the words one by one with somewhat unsettling pauses between them.
"No milk…
or cookies…
here.
Not for…
a long…
time."
The giant stone cat behind it stepped down from its pedestal.
Finner gulped as three more joined it.
Some were missing bits of ear or tail,
but the one that yawned seemed to have all of its very sharp teeth.
"So tell me…
why I…
should say yes?"

The lean santa reached into her sack.
For a heartbeat Finner thought she was going to throw another foam grenade,
but instead she pulled out a head.
A toy head,
Finner noticed with relief,
with dents and scuffs and a scorch mark on one cheek.

The mummy hissed again.
"You bring…
*that*…
here!?"

The santa hefted her sack.
Loose pieces of metal clinked against one another.
The mummy hissed again,
and the cats around it growled.
"Oh, don't be a bunny," the santa said dismissively.
"It would take a dozen elves a week to put it back together,
and anyway,
I didn't manage to salvage a battery."
She jerked her chin at the santa with the ax.
"The flips ambushed us when we were out on a mission for the sensei."

"Followed us back somehow,"
the big santa added grimly.
"Probably makin' a mess of the place right now."

The lean santa shook her head.
"Sensei will be all right."
She was hurt,
Finner realized,
but trying hard not to show it.

One of the stone cats yowled softly.
The mummy huffed.
"Let us…
hope so.
I will…
grant you…
refuge.
Follow…
me."

It turned toward the pyramid,
then hesitated.
"And…
please…
don't mind…
the mess.
I'm…
redecorating."

As they climbed the worn stone steps on the pyramid
Finner sidled over to the lean santa.
"Can you please tell me what's going on?"

She sighed.
"The usual, I'm afraid.
We're trying to save the worlds."

## Some Introductions

Zombies and mummies are similar in many ways—the shambling gait,
the moaning,
and of course the whole "undead" thing—but there are important differences.
First,
mummies are generally (ex-)royalty,
while zombies tend to have been idiots who went into the basement after dark
despite the strange sounds they heard
or didn't run fast enough when someone shouted,
"Look out, they're coming!"

Second,
mummies are created through a complex multi-step process
during which the internal organs and the brain are removed,
packed in salt,
and stored in canopic jars.
"Which is…
just a…
fancy name…
for jars…
that hold…
someone's…
squishy bits,"
the mummy explained as they climbed the stairs
to an entrance in the side of the pyramid
that seemed quite small compared to the pyramid
but was actually quite large.

Third,
and perhaps most importantly,
zombies devoured the brains of the living.
"Or sometimes…
their livers…"
the mummy wheezed.
"It's a…
cultural…
thing."
Mummies,
on the other hand,
were strictly vegan:
*very* strictly,
since they didn't eat at all.
"Though…
we do…
enjoy a…
nice cup…
of tea,"
the mummy added wistfully.

Two stone cats sat on their haunches at the top of the steps.
One blinked slowly as they entered the pyramid,
but other than that they might truly have been statues.
The corridor inside was wide enough for the four of them to walk side by side.
Torches guttered in sconces every few dozen strides,
their light making the figures painted on the walls dance.[^walls-dance]

[^walls-dance]: It didn't occur to Finner until much later to wonder about the torches. Were they some sort of magical everlasting torch? Or were they delivered on Tuesdays and Fridays like the cheese his father was so fond of? And why torches rather than lamps? The mummy's rags looked awfully flammable…

The corridor turned into a ramp,
which turned left and left again,
each leg slightly shorter than the one before as they climbed the inside of the pyramid
"Voila,"
the mummy rasped at the top,
waving them forward proudly.

To call the chamber they entered a "room" would have been like calling the pyramid "large".
If Gran-Granna Tumbly's house had been tucked into one corner
there would still have been plenty of space for a hockey rink and a river barge.
And while there wasn't actually a hockey rink,
there *was* a barge,
along with dozens of statues,
a chariot,
six life-sized wooden horses,
and a small catapult.

There was also something that looked suspiciously like Gran-Granna's living room.
"Please…
sit down…"
the mummy told them,
gesturing at a matched pair of blue-and-gold striped couches.
"I know…
it's not…
much…
to look at…
but…"

"Oh, it's amazing," the lean santa said
when the mummy's pause stretched longer than usual.
"And I *love* the side tables."

"Thank you,"
the mummy said proudly.
"Here…
let me…
show you…
the original."
It pulled a magazine out of the pile on the workbench and flipped through it,
muttering under its lack of breath.
"There!
What do…
you think?"

It thrust the magazine at the lean santa
while the burly one plopped himself down on the nearest couch,
which creaked slightly under his weight.
Finner sat hesitantly on the other
as the lean santa agreed that of *course* you had to see it in the room
to really appreciate it,
particularly with such difficult lighting.

"Excuse me," Finner finally interrupted,
after trying and failing twice to screw up enough courage to speak.
"But can someone please tell me what's going on?
And,
um,
how I can get home?
Because I'd like to,
if that's all right."

"Probably not a good idea right now,"
the lean santa said,
setting aside the filigree tea tray
that the mummy had casually mentioned was an antique.[^antique-living]
"I'm sure Sensei Tumbly is all right,"
she added quickly.
"But we should give her time to sort things out."

[^antique-living]: By the standards of the living, anyway.

"Why do you keep calling her 'sensei'?"
Finner asked,
instantly annoyed at the whining tone in his voice.
"And where are we,
and who are you?"

The three santas exchanged looks.
The lean santa sighed.
"I'm Santa Hood.
This is Santa Greenwood, and…?"

"Santa Hotep,"
the mummy supplied.

"And we're in an alternate universe, right?"
Finner asked.
"I'm not stupid," he added when Santa Hood raised an eyebrow.

"We are," she confirmed.
"We're each the santa in our world.
A lot only have one,"
she added as Finner opened his mouth.

"That sounds kind of lonely,"
he said.

Santa Hood shrugged.
"It works out.
Some people think we're why all those universes exist.
Every kind of santa that can be, must be.
It's some kind of quantum thing."
She shrugged again.

"So what kind of santa are you?"
Finner asked.

She grinned wickedly.
"I'm the kind that steals presents from the rich and gives them to the poor."

Finner digested that for a moment.
"And you're the kind that chops down trees and gives everyone firewood as a gift?"
he asked Santa Greenwood.

"No,"
the burly man growled.
"The gifts are for the trees.
The ax is for anyone who tries to hurt 'em."

"I haven't…
brought anyone…
a gift…
in years,"
Santa Hotep wheezed wistfully in the awkward silence that followed.
"After…
the oasis…
dried up…
they all…
moved away.
It's peaceful…
but…
I do miss…
the unwrapping…
sometimes."

Santa Hood patted the mummy's hand.
"Well, you've certainly kept yourself busy.
This place looks *amazing*."

"I have…
Miz Tumbly…
to thank…
for that."
The mummy took a faded magazine off a lacquered bookshelf.
"She started…
bringing me…
these.
It was…
the nicest thing.
I hope…
she's…
all right."
It paused.
"Or if not,"
it added reflectively,
"I hope…
Someone will…
wrap her.
It would…
be nice…
to have…
company."

"I'm sure Sensei Tumbly is fine,"
Santa Hood said firmly,
then winced.

"Here, let me have a look at that,"
Santa Greenwood said gruffly.

Santa Hood nodded
and pulled up her coat to reveal a purpling bruise the size of Finner's hand
on her smooth, dark skin.

Finner's mouth suddenly felt dry.
"I, um… Is there a…? I mean, I, um, I could really use…" he stammered.

"Of course…"
Santa Hotep waved a bandaged arm.
"Past…
the barge."

*Somewhere in the multiverse,
someone has undoubtedly written an entire book about washroom facilities in ancient pyramids.
I'm not that book,
so let's just skip over the next few minutes.*

Finner closed the door carefully behind him.
He could hear the santas talking quietly in the distance,
but seized by a sudden curiosity,
he turned left instead of right.
The horses tethered to the chariot were very life-like but just wood.
The swords and shields on display were ever-so-slightly dusty but very clearly functional,
and—

He pulled up short.
There,
hidden behind a vertically-hung rug,
stood a workbench.
Carpenters' tools lay on it,
some in wooden racks but others laid out for use
next to a trio of unfinished stool legs.
He sniffed the air.
Yes:
he could definitely smell fresh-cut wood.

"Can I help you?"
a voice rumbled behind him.

Finner turned around slowly.
The stone cat was missing one ear but seemed to have all of its teeth.
Certainly lots of teeth.
"I, um—I was just—"

"Perhaps you should rejoin the others,"
the cat said,
its tone indicating that the "perhaps" was just politeness.

"Um, sure, of course."
Finner hesitated.
"I didn't know Santa Hotep still had elves."

"He doesn't,"
the cat said.
"Nobody has used any of this in many years."

*Then why can I smell wood?*
Finner wondered but didn't say
as he let the rug fall back in place.

"There you are,"
Santa Greenwood said as he rejoined the others.
"I was just saying we ought to get young Findlay home."

"It's Finner, actually,"
Finner corrected,
or would have if an ear-splitting yowl hadn't interrupted them.

Santa Greenwood surged to his feet at the sound,
his ax in his hands.
Santa Hotep drew a circle with its fingertip on the mirror by its elbow.
The mirror's surface rippled and reformed to show
the steps leading up to the pyramid entrance,
where the stone cats were fighting a quartet of hooded figures
wielding swords and ray guns.

"Impossible,"
Santa Hotep wheezed angrily.
"They can't—"

"They have,"
Santa Hood snapped.
"We need to get out of here *now*."

Santa Hotep nodded.
"This way."

The chamber was even larger than Finner had realized.
He froze as a statue of a hyena turned its head.
"Automated defenses,"
Santa Hood said without breaking stride.
"Pretty standard in a place like this.
I *am* a thief,"
she added over her shoulder.

Santa Hotep led them to a completely unremarkable patch of the wall.
"Left…
left…
right…
and ah…
whoopsie doo…"
it recited
as it did a slow shuffling dance.
The tiles beneath its feet went *click*.
With the slightest of scraping sounds
the stone block in front of it pivoted
to reveal another passage,
smaller and narrower than the one they had climbed
but lit by the same flickering torches.

Up, up, up they went.
The passage cut back on itself so many times that Finner lost count.
He was just about to ask how much further it was
when he rounded a final bend and was almost blinded by
the bright blue square of empty sky in front of them.
That,
and the dazzling green beam of a ray gun blast.

"Jet packs," Santa Greenwood spat
"Of *course* they'd have jet packs."
He brought up his ax
just in time for the next shot to bounce off its shiny blade.

"Where's the wherever?" Santa Hood demanded as the mummy caught up with them.

"Right…
in front…
of you…"
it wheezed.

"I don't see anything!" Santa Greenwood shouted,
deflecting another shot.

"Give up! You have nowhere to run!"
an amplified voice shouted from somewhere above them.

"I beg your pardon?" Santa Hood shouted back.

"I said—"

"I'm sorry, but he's not home!"
She looked at Finner and winked.
"Would you like to leave a message?"

"Just give us the wherever code to the building and we'll let you go,"
the amplified voice shouted.
"How does that sound?"

"Why don't you come here and we'll talk about it?"
Santa Greenwood bellowed.
Then he said "AAAAHHH!" in a very loud voice
because the mummy
(who was much stronger than it looked)
pushed him, Santa Hood, and Finner out into the empty air
where they fell screaming to their deaths.

## A Last-Minute Rescue

At least,
that's what Finner expected would happen
in the heart-stopping second before the universe
did the "see it both ways" trick again
and the desert was an ocean,
a beautiful blue ocean with nice soft waves instead of nasty bone-breaking solid ground.

Santa Greenwood made the biggest splash:
between his size and hitting the water in a spread-eagle bellyflop,
he actually, briefly, made a dent in the water.
Finner had only a moment to admire how Santa Hood tucked in her elbows
to plunge into the water as gracefully as a seahawk diving for fish
before he discovered the hard way that the water was very, very cold.

He spluttered to the surface,
thrashing his arms against the weight of his suddenly-sodden coat.
"Help!"
His boots felt like concrete blocks on his feet.

"Periwinkle!" Santa Greenwood roared.

"I'm working on it!" Santa Hood shouted back.
She pulled something orange out of her sack.
With a sharp *pop!* and a hiss it began to inflate.

"Be careful with your stupid ax!" she yelled at Santa Greenwood
as she tossed her sack into the little dinghy.

"I'm bein' careful! And it ain't stupid!" the burly santa yelled back.
A dozen powerful one-armed strokes
and he dragged himself up out of the water,
nearly flipping the dinghy over as he did so.

Finner was too busy not drowning to really notice this.
He'd managed to kick off one boot[^one-boot]
and was struggling to unbutton his coat
when Santa Hood popped up beside him like an otter and said,
"Easy, easy, let me do that."

[^one-boot]: His mother always told him to do up his laces properly so he didn't trip and break his neck. It had never occurred to him to say, "But what if I fall into another universe and need to get them off so I don't drown?"

Panting and kicking furiously to stay afloat,
Finner squelched his panic long enough
for Santa Hood's deft fingers to undo his buttons
and hold his sleeves so that Finner could pull his arms out of his coat.
It floated away like a sad red jellyfish,
taking with it a handkerchief,[^handkerchief]
a folded piece of paper with a game of Hangman on it
left over from a particularly boring writing class at school,
and a mostly uneaten piece of toffee.

[^handkerchief]: Santas don't use kleenex. That's for wrapping presents.

A few moments later Santa Hood boosted Finner into the dinghy
and slithered in after him.
"Y'aright?"
Santa Greenwood asked,
wringing seawater out of his beard.
He had a bit of seaweed in his hair,
Finner noticed.

Santa Hood nodded, shivering.
"Lucky we d-d-didn't wind up in some d-d-drowned city."

"There's that.
You remember Kraken Claus?"
Santa Greenwood shook himself like a very large dog
and laid his ax across his knees,
glaring at the ocean
as if a billion liters of salt water could be intimidated.

Santa Hood forced a smile,
her teeth chattering.
"Don't you have something in your sack to keep you warm?"
Finner asked,
hoping the answers would be "yes" and "I have a spare".

But Santa Hood shook her head.
"Used it a c-couple of m-missions ago."

Santa Greenwood patted her shoulder.
"Don't worry.
We're okay for now."

As if on cue,
a triangular gray fin sliced through the water beside them.
"Is there a Santa Shark?" Finner asked weakly,
hoping the answers would be "yes" and "it's actually very friendly".

"I'm afraid so," Santa Hood said grimly,
her teeth still chattering.
"She takes everything she c-can and never g-gives *anything* back.
Be c-careful with that!" she snapped
as Santa Greenwood hefted his ax.

"I'm bein' careful!" Santa Greenwood said,
and then three things happened more or less simultaneously:[^simultaneously]

[^simultaneously]: Whether or not things happen at the same time depends in part on who you are. If you're a helium atom, for example, you can expect to exist for billions of years, so "at the same time" includes pretty much all of human civilization.

1.  A second, larger gray fin appeared in the water beside the first.

2.  The edge of Santa Greenwood's ax brushed against the dinghy's rubber gunwale.

3.  There was a sharp *crack!*
    like someone snapping a piece of wood over their knee.
    A moment later a cannonball whistled over their heads.

"Look out!" Finner shouted instinctively as:

1.  The larger gray fin changed course to head straight for them.

2.  Air began feeping[^feeping] out of the dinghy;

3.  A set of black sails appeared on the horizon.
    There was another *crack!*
    and a second cannonball splashed into the water nearby.

[^feeping]: A word that other worlds would do well to borrow. Our world's contribution would be "phlegm", which also it sounds exactly like the thing it describes.

Santa Greenwood stood up,
nearly spilling the others into the ocean.
"Come on, Periwinkle, gimme something!" he roared,
hefting his ax again.
"Chili grenades! Tangle muffins! Anything!"

"I'm out!" Santa Hood,
her arm deeper in her sack than basic physics should have allowed.[^basic-physics]

[^basic-physics]: This actually made basic physics quite uncomfortable, but nobody thought to ask it. Quantum physics would have just been, "Like, whatever."

"Look!" Finner shouted.
A wooden ship painted the same menacing black as the sails crested the horizon.
There was an orange flash on her deck and another *crack!*.
A third cannonball hit the water between the dinghy and the circling gray fins.

"Ya gormless nabblers!" Santa Greenwood bellowed,
shaking his ax so hard that he lost his footing.
Finner grabbed the santa's belt to stop him from falling out of the dinghy
and was nearly pulled out himself.
"Why don'tcha come here an' try that, eh?"

A fourth *crack!*, another cannonball.
As the ship closed on them
Finner could see crew shouting and waving in the rigging and on the deck.
"Wait! They're not shooting at us!"
Finner exclaimed.
"They're shooting at the sharks!"

"Or they just can't aim!"
Santa Hood snapped,
her arm still deep in her sack.

And then the smaller gray fin decided it was now or never
and changed course and raced toward them.
The shark the fin belonged to was a menacing dark bulk just below the surface.

Finner felt the dinghy squelch beneath his bootless foot
as Santa Greenwood tried to stand up again
and Santa Hood ducked so as not to be beheaded by the ax
he actually wasn't being very careful with.
"Got it!" she said triumphantly,
pulling something out of her sack and throwing it.

There was a loud bang.
Sea water splattered all over them.
Finner's eyes immediately began itching and streaming.
"One last ch-chili bomb," Santa Hood said.

"Ahoy!" a voice called as the two gray fins turned and fled.[^sharks-flee]
"Might ye be in need of assistance?"

[^sharks-flee]: Or rather, decided quite independently of their changed circumstances that it was a good time to pursue other opportunities, because sharks never "flee".

Santa Greenwood's face fell.
"Oh, not him," he muttered.
"Anyone but him."

"Who?" Finner and Santa Hood asked simultaneously.

The black ship came up beside them.
Rope ladders were already draped over her side,
each with a sailor hanging from it with their arm out.
With a one, two, and *three* (Santa Greenwood being rather heavy)
the dinghy was left empty in the ship's wake.[^empty-dinghy]

[^empty-dinghy]: The dinghy rather appreciated having some time to itself, what with the first few minutes of its inflated existence being so full of new experiences. Then it sank, which only goes to show—something.

Finner clambered up the ladder and onto the deck.
Given recent events,
he was completely unsurprised to find himself face-to-face with another santa.
But what a santa:
between the eyepatch,
the skull earrings,
the peg leg,
the parrot (who had a peg leg of her own)
and the very large, very sharp cutlass in his hands,
*this* was the kind of santa other santas dreamed of being.

"Well, ain't you the lucky ones?" the santa boomed,
a twinkle in his eye.
"Us happenin' along just now an' all.
Coulda been mighty dicey there, mighty dicey indeed."

"We were doin' all right," Santa Greenwood muttered sullenly.

"Aye, I could see that," the pirate santa said,
straight-faced.
"Ah, but where's me manners?
I'm Cap'n Clausbeard,
an' this is my crew."
He waved his sword to include the dozen figures
now standing around and behind the new arrivals,
all of whom just happened to have sharp pieces of metal in their hands.

"This is Santa Hood,"
Santa Greenwood said reluctantly.
"And Figleaf—they're Vidancia's grand-something."

"It's Finner," Finner corrected automatically,
but no-one noticed.

The pause stretched
until Santa Greenwood sighed heavily and gestured at Captain Clausbeard.
"And this is my dad."

"Pleased t' meet yez."
The peg-legged santa doffed his hat and bowed in Santa Hood's direction.
"The crew'll find some you some tea and dry clothes.
Got plenty o' both this trip,"
he added expansively.

"Oh,
so you're hauling cargo now?"
Santa Greenwood muttered.

His father scowled,
and for a moment Finner could see
what Santa Greenwood was going to look like when he was older.
"Nothin' shameful about haulin' cargo when there's danger about.
Times like these,
I figure it's every true santa's duty to—"

"Tell no tales! Tell no tales!"
the parrot squawked,
nipping at the pirate's ear.

"Ow!
Avast, you pestilence,
I wasn't goin' to—"
Clausbeard swatted at the parrot,
and for a moment Finner could see
how much the pirate must have looked like Santa Greenwood in his youth.
"Anyway,
let's get you that tea."

<section markdown="1">

## Some Explanations

A few minutes later
Finner was sitting on a stool in a slightly cramped cabin
with a thick blanket wrapped around his shoulders
and a steaming mug of something called seaweed tea in his hands.
Santa Hood was somewhere beneath an even larger blanket on the bunk next to him,
while Santa Greenwood had solved the problem of being too big for the furniture
by sitting on the floor.
*Deck,* Finner corrected himself.
*It's called a deck on a ship.
Which this is.*

He shook himself.
"About the whole saving the worlds thing," he ventured.
"And you keep talking about 'flips'."

Santa Greenwood swallowed a swig[^swig] of tea
and set the mug on the deck beside his ax.
"It's what folk call other folk who are all flipped around.
Santas wanting to make things,
elves wanting to deliver—it ain't natural."

[^swig]: Which is what a "gulp" is called when you're on a ship.

A chill ran up Finner's spine
that had nothing to do with how cold he had been a few minutes ago.
"And you're— they're—"

"It started off with just a handful of weirdos,"
Santa Hood's muffled voice said from under the blanket.
"After Sensei Tumbly and others got everyone to understand that
it's okay for santas to marry santas and elves to marry elves,
a few people got carried away and started saying
we should throw out all the other rules too.
Nobody took them seriously at first.
People get odd notions sometimes,
especially on worlds where they're on their own."

"Callin' it 'odd' is more polite than I'd be."
Santa Greenwood picked up his mug and scowled at its contents.
"When sensible folk wouldn't listen to their nonsense,
they just started *doing* stuff.
Santas making socks and cutlery and what-not,
elves sneaking into places they didn't belong to make deliveries…"

"So what happened?"
Finner asked,
looking into his tea so that he didn't have to make eye contact.

"Turned out a lot more people agreed with them than anyone would have though,"
Santa Hood said wearily.
"Or didn't exactly agree with them but figured it was none of their business
or they didn't have a right to say it was wrong.
Sensei Tumbly was one of the few who did."

Santa Greenwood nodded.
"Cost Vidancia a lot of friends.
Folk that stood with when she and Shady Ann were marching and writing letters
and getting themselves arrested—turned out a lot of them were okay with this nonsense."
He shook his head.
"It's disrespectful, is what it is, after all Vidancia's done."

"Who's being disrespectful?" boomed Captain Clausbeard,
who had just opened the cabin door without bothering to knock.
His parrot squawked something in his ear.
"Ah. Right. Them.
Anyway, what's it like bein' back in your old cabin, eh, lad?
Must bring back memories, eh?"

Santa Hood raised an eyebrow.
"This was *your* cabin?"

Santa Greenwood muttered something that might have been "yes".
Santa Hood jerked her chin at a pencil drawing of a tropical island
nailed up beside the cabin's single round porthole.
"I didn't know you were so artistic."

"Oh, my boy was a wizard with all that stuff,"
Captain Clausbeard said proudly.
"An' even better at crochet.
Why, I still have a couple of doilies that—"

"I *think*," Santa Greenwood interrupted,
"I think we oughta focus on the problem at hand, don't you?
Namely how we're going to get Fiddler—"

"Finner."

"—back where he belongs
and what in the name of rain we're going to do about these,
these *troublemakers*,
because I for one have had *enough*!"
He thumped his meaty fist on the deck,
making Captain Clausbeard's parrot[^parrot] squawk.

[^parrot]: The parrot would have been somewhat offended by this phrasing, as she thought of the captain as being hers. Luckily for our story, the parrot found turning pages so difficult that she never bothered to read books.

Whatever the captain might have said in reply to that
was cut off by a cry from the crow's nest.
"Trouble, cap'n!
We got smoke up over the horizon!
North by nor'west,
a hundred fathoms high an' headed our way!"

The humor dropped from Captain Clausbeard's face like spilled porridge.
"Well, lad, are ye fit to fight?" he asked.

"Fit enough."
Santa Greenwood clambered to his feet,
swore as his head hit the ceiling,
and picked up his ax.

Captain Clausbeard nodded.
"Glad t' hear it.
Your friends can stay here 'til we know whether we're eatin' peaches or pickles.
That's an order," he added as Santa Hood opened her mouth.

"Yes, cap'n," she said neutrally.

Captain Clausbeard grinned and doffed his hat again before stomping out,
his peg leg thumping on the deck.
"Avast, ye scallywags!" he bellowed.
The door closed behind him.

Santa Greenwood hefted his ax.
"Don't worry about us,"
Santa Hood said perkily,
wriggling a bit to free herself from her blanket's embrace.
"We'll be safe in here.
Besides, I'm not done studying this masterpiece of yours."

Finner expected Santa Greenwood to scowl or make a joke.
Instead, he spoke quietly, without looking at either of them.
"That's Isla del Tesoro.
It was my first forest.
More of a jungle, really,
but there were trees big as masts with these great beards o' moss hangin' off them.
The rest o' the crew didn't like it—they all got itchy
as soon as they were out of earshot o' the waves,
but you could walk for hours an' see nothin' that wasn't green.
First time I spent the night there felt like comin' home.
Drawin' that picture felt like makin' myself a promise.
Kinda surprised my dad left it up,
what with all the arguin' we did when I told him I was leavin'."

For a long moment the only sounds were the creaking of the ship's timbers
and muffled shouts from the crew.
"We'll be safe in here,"
Santa Hood repeated,
her voice as quiet as Santa Greenwood's had been.

Santa Greenwood nodded,
yanked the door open,
swore as his forehead hit the lintel,
and closed the door behind him.
Santa Hood rolled her head to work out a kind in her neck.
"So," she said conversationally,
letting the blanket slide down so that Finner could see the ray gun aimed at his chest.
"How about you tell me who and what you really are?"

</section>

<section markdown="1">

## An Airborne Attack

Finner's hands put themselves up.[^hands-up]
"I'm Finner!" he exclaimed.
"Finner Tumbly!"

[^hands-up]: Whic is more accurate than saying "he raised his hands" because his brain wasn't really involved in the process.

"Uh huh.
And I suppose you want me to believe that
you just happened to be in sensei's house when the flips followed through the wherever?
And again to Santa Hotep's pyramid?"

Finner's mouth worked.
"I don't know anything about that!" he finally managed to get out.
"I don't know why you call my gran-granna 'sensei',
or any of this!
I just want to go *home*."

Santa Hood pressed a button on the ray gun with her thumb.
The ray gun hummed in response.
"You're not going anywhere until I'm sure you're not a robot."

"A what?"

"Uh uh uh."
Santa Hood gestured with the gun.
Finner's hands shot back into the air.
"Better.
I said,
prove to me that you're not a robot.
Because you were gone an awfully long time at Santa Hotep's.
They could have replaced you then."

For a moment Finner just gaped at her.
*You could check my pulse,* he thought,
immediately squashing the idea
back into the corner of his brain where he kept all the other troubling thoughts
he had about women, comma, attractive.
"I'm bleeding," he blurted.
"I mean, just a bit, but I scraped my arm.
I can…?"

Santa Hood nodded permission.
Arms still in the air,
Finner pulled his right sleeve down to his elbow.
"See?" he said hopefully.
It wasn't actually much of a scratch,
but it was red and yay,
there was in fact a small streak on his skin.

Santa Hood studied it a moment,
then pressed the button the ray gun again.
With a disappointed *mmrrrmmm*
the end of the gun dimmed and blinked out.
"Here, take it."
She leaned forward to pass it to him and winced.

Finner put it on the tiny desk he'd been sitting on.
"How are your ribs?" he asked sulkily.

Santa Hood shook her head.
"I've had worse.
You don't learn to make the kinds of presents I make
without getting a few bumps and bruises.
Your gran-granna taught me that.
That's why I call her sensei," she added.
"When all the trouble started with the flips
she was one of the few people to say we had to do more than just talk."

Finner would have said, "I don't believe it,"
except he did.
The stone cat in Gran-Granna's front yard,
her magic sword:
even without all of that,
the idea was perfectly in character.

A hundred questions about robots and replacements whirled in his head.
What he asked instead was,
"Can I get you anything for your ribs?"

Santa Hood snorted, which made her wince again.
"Some tea would be nice,
but I think we'd both better stay down here for now.
Wake me up if anything exciting happens."

A few moments later she was snoring gently beneath her pile of blankets.
Finner put his head down on the little desk and tried to fall asleep as well,
but the rock and sway of the ship made his stomach flip-flop
every time he closed his eyes.
Finally he sat up,
rolled his head from side to side to get a kink out of his neck,
and picked up the ray gun Santa Hood had given him.

It looked like a well-made toy with its gnurled grip and shiny barrel,
but was heavy in a way that said,
"No, I can actually make holes in things."
He pointed it at the porthole,
closed one eye,
and said, "Blam!"

A brilliant green beam of light blasted the glass right out of the porthole.
Finner gaped,
still feeling the hum of the shot in his hand,
then tossed the ray gun onto the desk as if it had just bitten him.

"Wuzza?" Santa Hood grunted in her sleep.
Finner held his breath until she rolled over under blankets
and started snoring again.
The ray gun just lay there the whole time
like an unopened note for his parents from his writing teacher.[^writing-teacher]

[^writing-teacher]: The first time Finner had to bring home a note from that teacher, his parents let it sit on the dinner table *until dinner* before opening it. They didn't mention it or even look at it, which of course meant Finner couldn't think about anything else. It turned out to be a reminder about an overdue book addressed to another student, which left Finner feeling somehow cheated out of a calamity.

"Right," Finner muttered under his breath.
He picked up the ray run gingerly,
holding it with just his thumb and one finger.
The porthole was definitely glassless.
He brightened slightly.
Maybe instead of just being baggage he could actually help Santa Hood
(and Santa Greenwood too, of course).
For a moment he saw himself standing beside them,
blasting away with the ray gun while his new-found teammates tossed their grenades
and waved their ax menacingly.
Maybe he could even—

*Crack!*
*Crack!*
The ship shuddered beneath his feet as the cannons above him fired.
Shouts rang on the deck outside the cabin.
"Wuzza!?" Santa Hood grunted again, sitting up.
"Wuz g'non?"

"Stay here," Finner said firmly.
He tucked the ray gun into his trousers,
then imagined what would happen if it went off again
and transferred it to his pocket.
"I'll be right back," he promised
as he pulled the cabin door open
and stepped out into chaos.

Half a dozen sailors were firing rifles and crossbows into the air.
Half a dozen others were reloading the ship's cannons
as Captain Clausbeard and his parrot[^parrot-time] bellowed orders.
In between them,
Santa Greenbeard was hacking at an enormous black tentacle with his ax.
No, not a tentacle—it was a metal cable as thick as Finner's arm,
and it hung down from the blue-and-gray airship that was now above the ship.

[^parrot-time]: Sorry, sorry—the parrot that usually chose to spend time with the captain.

A second cable fell from the airship as Finner gaped up into the sky,
and then a third.
The sailors' bullets and arrows had no more effect on the airship
than Santa Greenwood's ax had on the cable.
"Stand by to repel boarders, ye grumble-fisted knucklewaddlers!"
Captain Clausbeard shouted,
drawing his cutlass and passing a tiny replica of it to the parrot,
who clutched the sliver-sized blade in its beak.

*Crack!*
*Crack!*
The cannons fired again.
Something thunked into the deck a few steps away from Finner
and began spewing smoke.
The cable snagged on a hatch and went taut.
*Snap!*
Finner ducked as half of the hatch flew through the air
and splashed into the ocean.

Someone yelled,
"Here they come, cap'n!"
as half a dozen elves and santas slid down the cable,
letting go just as they reached the height of the mast.
*Thump!* *Thump!* *Thump!*
The first three hit the deck,
tumbled head over heels,
and rolled to their feet with swords in their hands.

"Get on the blasted radio and get me some blased air support!"
Clausbeard roared at the nearest pirate.
"The rest o' you—hold 'em off 'til the flyers get here!"

Steel rang against steel.
Captain Clausbeard and his crew pressed hard against the attackers.
For a moment it looked like the fight would be over as quickly as it had begun,
but more boarders were sliding down the cables into the ship's rigging.

"Away wi' ye!" Santa Greenbeard bellowed.
With one might swing of his ax
he sent two elves flying over the gunwale.[^gunwale-sharks]
His backswing snapped a santa's sword in half.
He raised the ax over his head,
took aim—

[^gunwale-sharks]: Which made the sharks very, very happy.

—and froze as a dart the length of Finner's thumb
suddenly sprouted from the side of his neck.
"Oh drat," he said weakly.
The ax slid out of his hands.
He fell to one knee, then both,
his hand reaching for the dart as his eyes unfocused.

Finner spun around.
A single elf dressed in black hung in the rigging of the foresail,
a blowgun in der hand.
The elf caught Finner's eye and grinned
as de pulled another dart from the pouch on der belt
and put it between der teeth.
De raised the blowgun to der lips and took aim.

Afterward,
Finner could never remember actually drawing the ray gun.
It was just suddenly there in his hand.
A single brilliant bolt of green punched a smoldering hole in the foresail
an inch from the elf's head.
"Bwah!?" the elf tried to say,
then, "Uh oh."
De glared accusingly at Finner,
spat out the dart de had just swallowed,
and sagged in the rigging like a straw doll
hanging forgotten in a tired child's hand.

Finner didn't give himself time to think.
He spun around and fired again and again.
His shots went wild,
but all of a sudden it was no longer
just a battle between the pirates and the boarders,
It was a battle between the elves and the pirates and *him*.

"Their ship!
Blast their blasted ship, you blasted idiot!"
Captain Clausbeard shouted.
Finner squinted,
pointed the ray gun into the air,
and pulled the trigger
just as the deck swayed beneath him.
He took aim again,
flexing his knees in time with the ship's roll and heave,
and—

"Oh."
His hand flew to his neck.
There was something there.
There was—wait,
did he have a gym sock in his mouth?
It sure tasted like he did.
He turned his head sloooowly
and blinked at a second black-clad elf holding a blowgun,
and then everything went away,
including him.

## The Airship

When Finner was next aware of his own existence,
his head was several feet away from his body.
At least,
that's how he felt until he scrunched up his eyes
and opened them again to discover that
he was in fact lying on a padded table of some kind
in what looked like an operating room.
His mouth no longer tasted like a gym sock,[^gym-sock]
but his tongue still seemed a size larger than usual,
and the straps around his wrists and ankles
were just a little too tight to be comfortable.

[^gym-sock]: The particular sock he was thinking of had belonged to a classmate of his whose idea of "funny" was sneaking up behind people and stuffing a sock or a mitten in their mouth. He was eventually eaten by a crocodile while trying to win an ill-considered dare. Nobody really missed him except his parents, and even they were secretly a little relieved.

His brain paused and reversed
like a driver noticing an overlooked parking spot.
Straps?
Why was he strapped down in what looked like an operating room?
Half a dozen possible explanations raced through his mind,
each less comforting than the last.

He was about to call for help when the door near his feet slid open.
A santa wearing a white coat and a matching white mask stepped into the room,
exclaimed,
"You're awake!"
and fled.

"Hello?" Finner said.
"Could someone please—um, could someone please let me up?
I think I need to go to the bathroom."

The door slid open again.
The elf who entered this time was taller than the santa
and wore a blue uniform instead of a lab coat.
The ray gun in her hand was a twin of the one Finner had fired,
except hers had several tally marks scratched on the barrel
and was pointed at Finner.

"All right," she scowled,
"You have thirty seconds to convince me that we shouldn't just pitch you over the side."

"I—"
*I just want to go home,* he finished in his head,
but what he said was,
"I really do need to use the bathroom.
Please."

The elf scowled a moment longer,
then turned her head slightly.
"Go ahead," she ordered the santa without taking her eyes off Finner.
She held the ray gun steady as the santa nervously unbuckled the straps holding Finner down.

He sat up and rubbed his wrists.
The elf waggled her ray gun toward the door.
"Out and to the right," she said curtly.
"And don't try anything funny."[^try-funny]

[^try-funny]: She probably didn't mean, "Don't try stuffing a sock in my mouth," but we'll never know.

"To the right" was a narrow corridor with painted metal walls and a rubberized floor.
Flat strips set into the ceiling cast orange light
on doors like the one that slid closed behind them,
each with a number and a cryptic legend like "Aux. Batt." stenciled on it.
"One eighty one," the elf told Finner.
He fumbled with the door's handle,
then sighed with relief at the sight of a perfectly normal toilet and sink.

"I'll be right here," the elf warned,
leaning back against the opposite wall and crossing her arms.
Finner nodded and slid the door shut.

*I've been telling this story more or less as it happened
because that's what books are supposed to do.
I haven't bothered with details
like the precise color of Santa Hotep's couch (dusty rose)
or the number of sails on Captain Clausbeard's ship (seven)
because they didn't seem important.
The two and a half minutes that Finner spent in the bathroom matter even less,
so let's just skip ahead to the moment after he washed his hands.*

Finner slid the door open.
The elf hadn't shifted,
and neither had her scowl,
but her ray gun was holstered on her hip instead of in her hand.
"Let's go," she ordered,
nodding to show the way.
"And remember, don't try anything—damn, why do they always run?"
Because of course that's what Finner did.

His boots thumped on the rubberized floor as he pelted down the corridor.
The first door he tried was locked.
So was the second,[^second-door]
but the handle of the third turned and clicked.
He slid the door out of his way,
ducked in,
and pulled the door closed again as quietly as he could.

[^second-door]: Which is why he never got to find out what "BCB RNV" meant, or why there was a hand-lettered note below the title reminding readers to make sure their next-of-kin form was up to date before entering.

The room was completely dark.
Finner patted the wall next to the door
until he found a switch,
then hesitated.
It might be a light,
but it might also—he wasn't quite sure what,
but given how things had been doing,
"alarm" and "trap door" both seemed possible.
Instead,
he pressed his ear to the door
and listened for sounds of pursuit.
There was nothing except his own breathing
and the deep *thrum thrum thrum* of a distant motor.

He turned,
put his back against the door,
and slid down to the floor.
"Well," he said,
then hugged his knees and pressed his face into them.
He had no idea where he was,
but he was hungry
and he just wanted to go home and be miserable there.

The moment passed,
as such moments always do.
He wiped his face on his trousers,
got to his feet,
and flipped the switch.

Four light strips in the ceiling came to life
to show Finner a room like the one he had woken up in.
Instead of an operating table it had a desk,
and the walls were filled with filing cabinets.
Each drawer had a picture on it of a santa or an elf.
Some were photographs,
some were drawings,
and others sparkled slightly and tracked Finner with their eyes.
There were nametags below the pictures,
each with a date and a six-letter code of some sort.

The door slid open behind him.
He whirled around.
The elf he had run away from looked at him with just a touch of annoyance on her face.
"How about you just come with me?"
she suggested.

Thirty seconds and three corners later,
the corridor brought them to a short ladder with rungs polished by hard use.
Finner clambered up into the murmur and bustle of
the bridge of a airship in flight.
The front wall was made of hexagonal glass panels
held together by thin strips of brass.
The walls to either side were filled with instruments, controls, and relays.
Santas and elves in blue uniforms paced back and forth beside them,
adjusting dials and jotting notes on clipboards.
Another uniformed elf stood facing the enormous window
with her hands clasped behind her back.
Her straight back and the cutlass at her side practically shouted "captain".

"Alpha Two reporting with salvage in tow,"
the elf behind Finner reported crisply.

"Thank you," the captain said without turning.
"Dismissed."

Alpha Two hesitated.
"Ma'am—"

"I'm sure it will be all right,"
the captain said smoothly.
"If he was going to explode, he would have done so by now."

"Yes, ma'am."
Alpha Two saluted, turned, and slid back down the ladder.

"Um, excuse me," Finner started,
then stopped in shock as the captain put her hand on the hilt of her cutlass
and turned around.

It was Gran-Granna Tumbly.

## Twins

People sometimes say, "Their jaw dropped,"
but that's not what actually happens.
What *usually* happens is that your mouth opens and closes a few times
because your brain knows you're supposed to say something like,
"What are you doing here?"
but can't find the right words (or even the wrong ones).
It's as if something was stuck in the elevator doors of your mind
and making it go *ding! ding! ding!* over and over again.

The airship's captain waited patiently for Finner's doors to close.
The bridge crew glanced at him occasionally but didn't interfere:
keeping an airship flying is tricky even in the best of circumstances,
and if Finner had been paying attention
he would have heard quiet murmurs about damage control crews reporting in
and steering vanes needing in-flight repairs.
The skirmish with Captain Clausbeard's ship had only been
the equivalent of two cats taking swipes at one another
and then pretending each other didn't exist,
but airships are fragile things.

"Gran-Granna?" Finner finally managed.
Even as he said it he belatedly realized that the elf wasn't his great-grandmother.
They were too tall and didn't have nearly enough wrinkles on their face,[^wrinkles-face]
though they *did* have an impressive scar on one cheek.
Plus,
even if the jingly bells on their hat were stuffed with yarn to muffle them,
they were clearly an elf,
not a santa.

[^wrinkles-face]: Old people don't actually have more wrinkles than young ones: young people's skin just hasn't had enough practice wrinkling to do it all the time. By the time you have smiled or frowned as often as someone like Gran-Granna Tumbly, your wrinkles are like a weight lifter's biceps. Some cultures regard strongly-defined wrinkles as a sign of virtue, and have specialized gyms where people wiggle their eyebrows or smirk over and over while a personal trainer urges them on.

"Captain Snood, actually," the elderly elf said in a clipped voice.
"And you must be Finbar."

"It's Finner,"
Finner corrected automatically.

"Finner," the captain repeated.
"I'll keep that in mind.
So what were you doing on board the *Dancing Marmot*
and how did you come by this?"
She pulled Santa Hood's ray gun out of one of the voluminous pockets of her overcoat.

"Um."
Finner cleared his throat.
"If the *Dancing Marmot* is the ship I was just on,
they rescued us from sharks because our rubber dinghy was sinking.
And I got that from one of the santas I was with.
I think she got it from one of the elves who was shooting at us
when we were—um,
well,
there was this pyramid.
I hope I didn't hurt anyone,"
he added hurriedly,
thinking of the glass that wasn't in the porthole of Santa Greenwood's old cabin any longer.

"Number two stabilizer is back in action, captain,"
an elf called out from a control panel to Finner's left.

"Thank you, Alpha Nine,"
the captain said without taking her eyes off Finner's face.
"Have the crew start work on the vents next."

"Aye aye, captain."

Captain Snood studied Finner a moment longer.
"Let me save us some time,"
she said as he opened his mouth.
"Tumbly is my sister.
We're twins, actually,
and our parents were so excited about having one of each
that they pushed her to be as santa as a santa could be
and me to be the perfect little elf.
The problem was that we are very alike in temperament,
so sitting in a workshop making trinkets and gew-gaws didn't really work out for me.
I wanted *this*."
Her gesture took in her cutlass, the bridge, the airship, and all the infinite worlds.

"But—" Finner started.

"The funny thing is,"
Captain Snood continued over top of him,
"Tum-tum enjoyed tinkering more than I did.
She kept coming up with new ways to rig harnesses for reindeer and,
well,
I presume she still has that sword cane she made?
Mm.
Wouldn't ever admit it was elfing, though.
Actually got quite shirty when I finally brought it up."
This time her gesture was very clearly aimed at the scar on her cheek.

"So—so you're a flip?"
Finner asked.

The captain looked at him with absolutely no expression.[^absolute-expression]
"That's not a word we use on this ship," she said levelly.
"Alpha Seven?"

[^absolute-expression]: In the sense of "absolute zero".

A nearby elf saluted.
"Yes, captain."

"Remove him from the bridge.
Find someone from Beta watch who has annoyed me recently
and tell them to keep him out of trouble."

A few moments later Finner was back at the bottom of the ladder.
"That way,"
Alpha Seven told him, pointing.
They had only gone three steps when an alarm began to blare
and the overhead lights changed from orange to red.
"All hands, all hands, battle stations!"
a crackly voice ordered through unseen speakers.
"Battery teams to firing stations!
Fire suppression teams, suit up!
This is not a drill!"

"Look!" Finner shouted.
Alpha Seven spun around.
In the moment it took the elf to realize de had been tricked,
Finner ran.

*I'm getting pretty good at this,* he thought giddily
as he half-slid, half-bounced around a corner.
There!
Door number one oh six, "Emerg Whvr".
He twisted the handle,
pulled it aside,
stubbed his toe on the sill as he stepped through,
and slid the door shut behind him.
*Snick!*
He hoped that was a lock.
Even more,
he hoped he wouldn't be here long enough to find out if it wasn't.

The room was smaller than the one he'd woken up in.
There was no furniture and no window,
just a line drawing of an archway on one whitewashed wall
with a pair of heavy brass dials beside it.
Codes were stencilled on the wall beside it:
"QCD 143.7 22.8",
"NAR 96.0 533.5"…
The last one was "OVB".
The numbers had been crossed out
and the words "We miss you Number Five" written in their place.

"Hey!"
A fist banged on the door.
"Open up!
Open up *now*!"

"Just a miiinuuute,"
Finner sang.
The codes had to stand for places,
and the numbers had to be how to set the dials to get to them,
but how was he supposed to know where "QCD" or "NAR" were
or whether they were safe to go to,
because he was pretty sure "OVB" wasn't.

"Last chance!" Alpha Seven bellowed.
"Either you open this door or I zap it open!"

Finner said a word he was pretty sure his parents thought he still didn't know.
If he picked a world at random
he could wind up on the moon without a spacesuit
or sitting on an ice floe wondering if the cold or Santa Kraken
would get to him first.

His shoulders slumped.
Better to be a prisoner than a meal.
"All right, I give up," he said,
or would have if a loud *boom!* hadn't shaken the airship
hard enough to knock Finner right off his feet.
The whole room—in fact, the whole airship—tilted to one side.

As Finner fell forward
his left hand hit one of the dials.
The light above his head flashed,
or maybe that just a side effect of him stretching in one impossible direction
while the universe stretched around him in another.

A moment later the lock sizzled and evaporated.
Alpha Seven slid the door open,
looked despondently at the empty room,
and used exactly the same word Finner had used moments before.

## Cold That Seeps Into Your Soul

You have probably been cold at some point in your life.
Maybe you wriggled out from under your blanket as a baby
and weren't yet able to wriggle back underneath it.
Maybe you didn't realize that someone else in the house liked cold showers
and turned on the water *while you were already standing there*
and were blasted with the last few seconds of that previous person's liquid self-loathing.
Or perhaps you have had to endure the kind of bone-deep chill of being poor in winter,
of not being able to afford to turn up the heat during the day
or to buy a coat that's thick enough to keep out the wind.
That kind of cold is the worst:
it seeps into your soul as well as your body
because you lose hope of it ever ending.

Thirty seconds after whumping
into a snowbank somewhere very Arctic,
Finner felt even colder than that.
The sky above him was an impossibly clear blue
and the sun was so bright he couldn't even look *near* it,
but each time he took a breath
he could feel the air going into every little corner of his lungs.
Tiny icicles had formed in his nostrils,
and his beard crackled each time he squinted.

The snow squeaked beneath his boots with every step.
Basic survival training is part of every santa's education,
so Finner knew that if he just stood still and shivered,
he wouldn't shiver for long.
He had no idea where he was going,
or even if there was a "where" to go to,
but he had to keep moving.

He struggled up to the top of yet another shallow ridge
and rubbed his eyes with fingers he could no longer feel properly.
Were there icicles in his eyelashes?
That wasn't important.
What mattered was that he could see something large, dark, and rectangular on the horizon.
A factory, a lab, a fortress:
as long as it wasn't ice,
it was something to aim for.
He stumbled toward it,
hugging himself to keep in what little body heat he had left.

When he reached the top of the next ridge
he had to stop and rub his eyes again.
An enormous factory sat in the shallow valley in front of him.
Finner could have stacked ten copies of his house on top of one another
and still not reached its steeply-slanted roof.
Turrets and towers,
windows of all shapes and sizes,
and steam—steam!—rising from chimneys.

He was about to start down the ridge
when one of the turrets turned its head and blinked.
Three people could have sat side by side between its eyes,
and its saber-sharp teeth were as long as Finner was tall.
The tattered remnants of its red vest were almost gray with grime and age.

Finner ducked behind the ridge line.
The creature was a santasaurus rex,
but twice the size of any he'd ever heard of,
and it was between him and his only hope of not freezing.

"Well that's a problem,"
a voice said.
"Whatever shall we do?"

Finner turned around slowly.
The elf standing there was wearing a carefully-patched green coat and a tasselled hat.
Der steel body and cheery painted face was scratched and dented,
but the ray gun de was pointing at Finner looked brand new.

Finner raised his hands.
"I g-g-give up," he chattered miserably.

The robot's lightbulb eyes blinked on and off rapidly.
"Oh dear.
Are you organic?
That's rather a poor choice in *this* climate."
De tucked the ray gun into a pocket and held out der hand.
"Come along.
Let's get you somewhere warm."

The robot's feet were flat round pads that left shallow circular dents in the top of the snow.
After stopping several times so that Finner could catch up with it,
it picked him up and carried him.
Finner would have protested, but he was too tired to more than mumble.
His ears had stopped hurting.
He was pretty sure that was a bad sign.
Why was he trying to keep his eyes open?
He knew it was important in a distantly theoretical kind of way.
Maybe he would remember when he woke up…

The next thing he remembered, everything hurt.
His ears, his toes, his back, his throat—his whole body
wanted him to know it was annoyed.
He was lying beneath a heavy pile of scratchy blankets,
and a quick, furtive inspection confirmed that yes,
he was naked.
Warm and not dead,
but someon had undressed him while he was unconscious.

He sat up,
clutching the blankets to his chest.
He had been lying on a bench whose vinyl cushions were flaking with age
in a room that looked like an abandoned subway station.
with cracked floor tiles and a truly memorable bouquet
that was equal parts damp earth, oily rust, and wet dog,
the last of which was coming from the blankets.
Two square glass panels connected to a boxy battery
cast a gloomy blue light over their crates, boxes, sacks, and bags,
each one overflowing with broken toys,
salvaged pieces of clothing,
and kitchen implements still in their immaculate plastic packaging.

"Ah, good, you're awake."
Finner twisted around at the sound of the robot santa's voice.
"I've made you some tea."

"What—what is this place?
What happened here?"
Finner asked,
gingerly taking the mug the robot offered him
and then doing a double-take.
This santa wasn't a robot.
This santa was very much alive,
though the years on her face made her look just as battered as the robot who had rescued him.

The santa tsk'ed.
"People, that's what happened.
People who never felt they had enough no matter how many presents they got.
It all turned into ray guns and speeches and explosions and more speeches.
How's the tea?"

"Fine," Finner said automatically,
by which he meant "warm".
"So are you—I mean, is anyone else—"

The santa sighed.
"A few here and there.
I help how I can."
She patted Finner's shoulder.
"Come on.
Get dressed and I'll show you."

Finner was *not* excited about going deeper into the derelict subway tunnel,
but when the santa picked up the light panels and strode away,
it was either that or sit in the dark
and listen to the slow drip, drip, drip from the ceiling.
He picked his way around the debris and piles of salvage.

The santa waited patiently for him in front of a heavy metal door.
"Here," she said,
passing one of the lights to Finner.
She punched a code into the panel beside the door,
turned a key in a lock,
turned a second key in another lock,
and swung the door open.

"Wow," Finner said.
The workroom in front of him was as clean as the subway behind him wasn't.
A double dozen workbenches lined the walls,
each one bearing lathes, saws, drills, and shelves of spare parts.
Cans of paint and oil were stacked neatly between them,
but he didn't see any of that,
not at first,
because standing in the center of the room was a red and white subway train.

"It's beautiful, isn't it?" the santa said quietly.

Finner just nodded.
The engine was decorated with silver bells
and had a small silver snowman as a crest.
Green enameled holly leaves ran up the sides of the three cars behind it.
Only when he looked at it again did he notice the scrapes and scratches,
the tell-tale scorch marks from ray gun fire,
and the sheets of plastic taped up where windows had once been.

"It's one of a kind," the santa said.
"Or it will be when I get it working.
See?"

She nudged Finner over to the nearest workbench.
Books and manuals lay on top of it,
some with scraps of paper tucked into them as placeholders.
Finner picked up one of the books.
*Mechanical Motors Part XVII: Reciprocating Drives* was stamped on the cover.
Inside were diagrams so detailed he would have needed a magnifying glass to make sense of them
and dense blocks of text interrupted by formulas and tables.
"Are you—are you repairing it yourself?"

The santa nodded.
"There was a school three stops up the line before everything fell apart.
Took a while,
but I managed to sneak past Santazilla and find these.
Elfabot's helping,"
she added.
"In fact,
de's doing most of the work.
But I'm learning."

Finner paused for a moment to consider his words.
"Isn't it a bit unusual for a santa to be doing this kind of thing?"
he finally ventured.

The santa shrugged.
"Santa this, elf that—all this who-does-what seems pretty foolish when the world has ended,
or nearly.
I think what matters is whether people are happy or not.
If we can fix the train and deliver some presents
then people will be happy and the world will be a better place."

She straightened some tools on the workbench nearest here.
"Now, how about you?
How did you wind up here?"

Finner put down *Mechanical Motors Part XVII*.
He didn't want to lie,
but after everything he had been through,
the whole truth seemed ill-advised.
"By accident," he said,
trying his best to sound embarrassed.
"I was fooling around with someone else's wherever.
So if I could just use yours to get home, I'd really appreciate it."

"I'm afraid that's going to be a bit difficult,"
a mechanical voice said.
"You see,
the only wherever left on this world is in the factory that Santazilla is guarding."
