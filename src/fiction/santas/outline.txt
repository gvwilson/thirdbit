# All the Other Santas

- *All the Other Santas* is a middle-grade story about a young santa who secretly wants to be an elf
  - A metaphor for being trans
  - And a commentary on how the revolutionaries of one generation become the reactionaries of the next
- The story is a fast-paced adventure with occasional moments of character-driven heartbreak
  - Chases, cartoon-ish battles, and sly asides
  - Periodically interrupted by serious moments that show characters' pain and their desire for love and acceptance
- Approx. 20 chapters of 1500-1600 words each for 31,000 words total

## Setting

- There are many parallel worlds, each with its own version(s) of Santa Claus
  - Santas use "wherevers" (portals) for travel
    - Traditionalists in some societies disguise their wherevers as chimneys
- Traditional division of labor is that elves make presents and santas deliver them
  - Santas are socially dominant, and view elves as stay-at-home introverts/nerds
- A generation ago there was a (mostly peaceful) struggle to up-end tradition
  - Before: santas could only deliver on one day of the year
    - Midwinter night, New Year's Eve, the solstice, etc.
  - After: santas can deliver on whatever day they choose
    - The Great Birthday Debate (started when santas wanted to deliver on birthdays)
  - Still considered out of bounds to deliver to someone more than once a year
    - "Then it's not special!"
- But santas still can't make things and elves still can't deliver them
  - Role reversal is a step too far for the older generation
- A "flip" is an elf who delivers or a santa who makes (the word is a slur)
  - Flips are becoming more common, and traditionalists are cutting themselves off from flips' worlds
  - Flips tend to deliver more often as well: "How can I *not* bring a hungry child a treat?"

## Characters

- Finner (protagonist): a young santa who secretly wants to make things
  - Character arc: finds the courage to defy his family (particularly his great-grandmother) and join the fight
  - Climax: when asked, "So do you want to be an elf?" he responds, "I don't know, but I want the chance to find out"
  - And realizes that he can't have that unless others have it too (none of us are free unless all of us are free)
- Gran-Granna Tumbly (antagonist): traditionalist matriarch of Finner's family
  - Her given name is Vidancia, but only Santa Greenwood calls her that
  - Was a leader in the Great Birthday Debate, but flip rights goes too far for her
  - Initially seems sympathetic (tough love) but betrays Finner by putting ideology ahead of empathy
  - Character arc: doesn't have the courage to change (opposite of Finner)
    - Reveal: secretly made things in her youth with Subway Santa and hates herself for it
  - Has been supporting Santinator's experiments to replace real elves with robot elves

  - Her given name is Periwinkle, but only Santa Greenwood calls her that
  - Wisecracking and beautiful (makes Finner acutely self-conscious)
  - One of Gran-Granna's agents in the clandestine struggle with the flip worlds
  - FIXME: need something to flip her to Finner's side so that she helps rescue him from The Building
- Santa Greenwood: a forest santa who delivers gifts to trees
  - His real name is Steve (but that's only mentioned once)
  - Big, gruff, straightforward (which isn't the same as simple-minded)
  - His decision to leave the sea for the forest foreshadows Finner's crisis and makes him sympathetic to it
    - His father (Clausbeard) never understood Greenwood's love for trees but accepted it
- Santa Hotep: a mummified santa who lives in a pyramid

  - Helps Finner come to terms with who he is
- Captain Clausbeard: a sea-going santa who is Santa Greenwood's father

  - And Clausbeard has come to accept Greenwood for who he is
- The Santinator (antagonist): robotic santa in a post-apocalyptic world
  - Has been making robot elves and other robot santas that only do the "right" things
    - "They know their place"
  - Finner: "But you're a santa! How can you make things if you think santas shouldn't make things?"
    - Santinator: "It's for the greater good"
- Captain Alpha One: a robotic replica of Gran-Granna Tumbly
  - Subway Santa made her as a present for Tumbly
  - Tumbly recoiled in horror: this is what drove her to her hardline position
  - FIXME: does Finner somehow arrange a confrontation?
- Zubi: a young elf that Finner meets at The Building
  - Was secretly delivering presents, but has given up and is trying to be "normal"
  - Doesn't have the courage to escape with Finner when the time comes
- Subway Santa: lives in the tunnels in the Santinator's post-apocalyptic world
  - FIXME: reveals the back story about Captain Alpha One
  - FIXME: make him an elf? he made Alpha One as a gift for Tumbly, then the Santinator in anger afterward?
- Santasaurus Rex: a dinosaur santa (minor character)
  - Thinks everything smaller than it is a snack
  - FIXME: just a humorous adventure interlude (don't try to tie in with *Madica*'s Santasaurus Rex)
- The Book
  - Narrates the warning at the start
  - The voice of the footnotes
  - Reappears to narrate the conclusion: if Finner can change, so can I and so can you

## Musings

- (How) does it overlap with *Madica*?
  - Current version uses the Arctic base and Santasaurus Rex
- Uncomfortable with Subway Santa (making fun of homeless people)
  - Roboclaus (cyborg)
  - His "father" built him to rebuild society after the world ended
  - Therefore doesn't think the elf-vs-santa distinction is important
- Why does the airship captain look like Gran-Granna Tumbly?
  - Because Tumbly used to make things, and was so good at it that she made a robot version of herself
  - But remained closeted and became zealously opposed to change
  - The cyborg version of her is just as strong-willed
  - Resolution at the end of the story is Finner bringing them together
  - Tumbly fails to rise to the occasion, but Finner joins the fight
- How does Roboclaus come into this?
  - Subway Santa becomes Roboclaus
- What is the climax of the story / the resolution of Finner's character arc?
  - See above
- What makes Gran-Granna Tumbly the villain and how do we find out?
  - See above
- Why is Finner able to fire the zap gun?
  - Because being an elf is a state of mind
- FIXME: why do Santa Hood and Santa Greenwood come and rescue Finner?
- FIXME: where/how does Finner discover that Santa Hotep is making things?
  - His elfs are all gone
  - The last ones taught him how to make sarcophagi
  - "After so many centuries, it doesn't seem to matter what we call ourselves"
