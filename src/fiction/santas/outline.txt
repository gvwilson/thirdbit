# All the Other Santas

- A middle-grade story about a young santa who secretly wants to be an elf (metaphor for being trans)
- Other theme: the revolutionaries of one generation become the reactionaries of the next
- The story is a fast-paced adventure with occasional moments of character-driven heartbreak
  - Chases, cartoon-ish battles, and sly asides
  - Interrupted by serious moments that show characters' pain and their desire for love and acceptance
- Approximately 31,000 words

## Setting

- There are many parallel worlds, each with its own santas and elves
  - Santas use portals called "wherevers" to travel between worlds
  - And within them to deliver gifts, although staunch traditionalists regard that as cheating
- Used to be that santas always married elves and vice versa
  - Long civil rights struggle led to santa-santa and elf-elf relationships being accepted
- Santas are socially dominant, elves are stay-at-home introverts
  - Traditional division of labor is that elves make presents and santas deliver them
  - Most people in the "gifting community" still believe this is how things ought to be
  - But some (referred to as "flips") are challenging this, and the fight is getting ugly
- Note: same-sex relationships are unremarkable in this world

## Characters

- Finner (protagonist): a young santa who secretly wants to make things like elves do
  - Character arc: finds the courage to defy his family and join the fight for flip rights
  - He realizes that he can't have what he wants unless others have it too
  - none of us are free unless all of us are free
- Gran-Granna Tumbly (principal antagonist): traditionalist matriarch of Finner's family
  - Character arc: revolutionary turned reactionary - doesn't have the courage to accept more change
  - Her given name is Vidancia, but only Santa Greenwood calls her that
  - Tumbly and her wife Shady Ann were famous campaigners for same-role relationships
    - Shady Ann disappeared years ago, presumed lost while making a difficult delivery
  - Tumbly is now part of a public campaign against the flips
    - Hood and Greenwood are part of the "dirty tricks" arm of this campaign
  - Secretly helping to kidnap flips for re-education at The Building
    - Hood and Greenwood don't know about this: finding out makes them change sides
- Santa Hood (ally to foe): steals from the rich to give to the poor (so she doesn't need elves of her own)
  - Wisecracking and beautiful (makes Finner acutely self-conscious)
  - Her given name is Periwinkle, but only Santa Greenwood calls her that
  - One of Gran-Granna's agents in her clandestine campaign against the flips
  - She and Greenwood are a couple: they follow Tumbly because she made their relationship possible
- Santa Greenwood (ally to foe to ally): a forest santa who delivers gifts to trees (soil, water, pruning)
  - When someone says "it looks like gardening" his response is "where do you think gardeners learned it?"
  - Big, gruff, straightforward (which isn't the same as simple-minded)
  - His father (Clausbeard) never understood Greenwood's love for trees but accepted it
    - Greenwood's decision to leave the sea for the forest foreshadows Finner's crisis
    - And makes Greenwood sympathetic to it
    - Contrasts with Gran-Granna Tumbly's refusal to accept Finner's differentness
  - His real name is Steve (but that's only mentioned once)
- Shady Ann: Tumbly's wife
  - Lives underground in a frozen post-apocalyptic world
  - Campaigned with Tumbly for same-role rights, then returned to her world
  - Started making things because her elf was dead and Elfabot wasn't reliable
  - Now uses the name "the subway Santa"
- Elfabot: a robotic helper
  - A robotic replacement for Tumbly and Shady Ann's elf
  - Its existence foreshadows the revelation about Tumbly using robots to substitute for kidnapped flips
- Ooph the Elf: Shady Ann's former partner and the creator of the replacement bots
  - Was Shady Ann's partner, but their relationship was always a sham
  - Presumed dead in the war that ravaged Shady Ann's world
  - Shady Ann kept the copy of himself that he made as a wedding gift (Elfabot)
  - He is now bitter about their relationship ending and about Shady Ann making things
  - So he makes bot copies of flips who are being re-educated
- Captain Clausbeard: a sea-going santa and Santa Greenwood's father
  - Their relationship has always been difficult: pirates aren't very good at talking about their feelings
  - Made more difficult by the fact that Clausbeard sympathizes with the flips ("pirates aren't much for rules")
  - But he has come to accept his son Greenwood for who he is
  - Clausbeard gets along very well with Santa Hood (they talk shop)
- Santa Hotep: a mummified santa who lives in a pyramid
  - Has no one left to deliver presents to, but finds it peaceful after thousands of years of delivery
  - Secretly started making things for himself after his last elf died (the work reminds him of the elf)
  - Represents elderly closeted queers who have come to accept themselves
  - Helps Finner come to accept who he is
- Zubi (contrasting path): a young elf that Finner meets at The Building
  - Was secretly delivering presents, but is trying to be "normal"
  - Unlike most inmates, wasn't abducted: turned himself in
  - Doesn't have the courage to escape with Finner: instead, reveals Finner's first escape plan
  - Despite that, Finner tries to help him escape again
- Santazilla: a giant *santasaurus rex*
  - Hunts for Shady Ann in the burned-out world
- The Book
  - Narrates the warning at the start
  - The voice of the footnotes
  - Reappears to narrate the conclusion: if Finner can change, so can I and so can you
