# All the Other Santas

- A middle-grade story about a young santa who secretly wants to be an elf (metaphor for being trans)
- Other theme: the revolutionaries of one generation become the reactionaries of the next
- The story is a fast-paced adventure with occasional moments of character-driven heartbreak
  - Chases, cartoon-ish battles, and sly asides
  - Interrupted by serious moments that show characters' pain and their desire for love and acceptance
- Approximately 31,000 words

## Setting

- There are many parallel worlds, each with its own santas and elves
  - Santas use portals called "wherevers" to travel between worlds
  - And within them to deliver gifts, although staunch traditionalists regard that as cheating
- Used to be that santas always married elves and vice versa
  - Long civil rights struggle led to santa-santa and elf-elf relationships being accepted
  - Note: same-sex relationships are unremarkable in these worlds
- Santas are socially dominant, elves are stay-at-home introverts
  - Traditional division of labor is that elves make presents and santas deliver them
  - Most people in the "gifting community" still believe this is how things ought to be
  - But some (referred to as "flips") are challenging this, and the fight is getting ugly
- Technology to make humanoid robots (bots) is tightly controlled out of fear of a robopocalypse
  - Rogue bots are bad guys in children's make-believe games (foreshadowing)

## Background

- Tumbly and Shady Ann helped lead the movement to allow santas to marry santas
  - And elves to marry elves, although that always felt like a bit of an afterthought to the elves
  - Ooph the Elf (Shady Ann's helper and former partner) helped
  - But was increasingly bitter about being left out and left behind
  - Despite this, made Elfabot as a wedding present for Shady Ann
- Flip rights movement started even before same-role relationships were legalized
  - Marginalized and mocked at the start, but grew more quickly than anyone expected
  - Most worlds are now pro-flip, which is hardening anti-flip sentiment in other worlds
- Shady Ann gave people in her world the gifts they most wanted
  - Which turned out to be destructive weapons and Santazilla
  - Wracked by guilt, she left her marriage and returned to her world with Elfabot to make amends
  - Started making things herself because Elfabot wasn't particularly competent
  - Led to rupture with Gran-Granna Tumbly, who couldn't accept that her wife was a flip
- This hardened Gran-Granna Tumbly's anti-flip stance
  - She helped create The Building
  - And recruited Ooph the Elf ("Shady Ann betrayed us both") to build robot replacements for kidnapped people
  - Tumbly knows that most people won't accept forcible re-education "yet"
- Somewhere in here, Tumbly started visiting Santa Hotep
  - It is one of the oldest santas alive (though it objects mildly to that term)
  - Provided strategic counsel during the same-role struggle
  - Has steered clear of politics more recently in favor of a quiet life (though it objects to that term)
- Tumbly has recruited a handful of operatives to help her campaign against flips
  - Hood liked making her own booby traps and was re-educated in The Building
  - Greenwood is there because Hood is his best friend
  - Ooph joined up because he thinks same-role relationships were a mistake and he wants to stop further rot
- Tumbly has discovered that Ooph is replacing people who aren't bots
  - Needs to cover this up before it undermines her anti-flip campaign
  - Oh, and before it destroys the worlds (her priorities here reveal her single-mindedness and bigotry)

## Changes Required

- The statue shows Tumbly and Shady Ann
  - But the picture shows the two of them and Ooph the Elf (foreshadowing)
- Mention that self-replicating bots are villains when Finner and his school friends play make-believe
- Shady Ann is yelled at when she delivers supplies to the survivors in her world
  - She fills in some back story, then says, "At least it's the last time"
  - Elfabot later tells Finner that it's going back to be with Shady Ann when she ends
- Finner goes home after escaping The Building and discovers he has been replaced by a bot
  - Very hurt that his parents can't tell the difference between their real son and a bot
  - After seeing their happiness, takes his tools from his room and leaves without them knowing he was there
- Santa Hood betrays Santa Greenwood during the rescue
  - The rescue was a test of his loyalty
  - But Greenwood brought the portable wherever from the *Dancing Marmot* because he didn't quite trust Santa Hood
  - Greenwood tells Finner not to judge Hood too harshly, then sacrifices himself to let Finner escape
- The airship captain doesn't look like Tumbly: she's a militant flip campaigner
  - Keep the room full of mannequin parts on the airship, but they are parts she has seized

- **Ooph's bots are attacking both sides to get them to turn on each other**
