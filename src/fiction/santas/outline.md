# All the Other Santas

- *All the Other Santas* is a middle-grade story about a young santa who secretly wants to be an elf
  - A metaphor for being trans
  - But also used for discussion of general social inequality
- The story is a fast-paced adventure with occasional moments of character-driven heartbreak
  - Chases, cartoon-ish battles, and sly asides
  - Periodically interrupted by serious moments that show characters' pain and their desire for love and acceptance
- 20 chapters averaging 1550 words each for 31,000 words total

## Setting

- There are many parallel worlds, each with its own version(s) of Santa Claus
- Traditional division of labor: elves make presents, santas deliver them
  - "Gender" roles: elves are stay-at-home introverts/nerds, santas are ebullient extroverts
  - Santas are socially dominant
  - A normal household is a santa and an elf, though polyelfery is also common
- What the protagonist doesn't know at the start of the story is that this tradition is being upended on many worlds
  - Started as "why do we only deliver once a year?" (metaphor for artificial scarcity in affluent societes)
  - Turned into "why can't santas make things if they want, and why can't elves deliver presents sometimes?"
  - By the time the story starts, only worlds where traditional roles are harshly enforced are still doing things the old way

## Characters

- Finner (protagonist): a young santa who secretly wants to be an elf
  - Character arc: finds the courage to defy his family (particularly his great-grandmother)
  - Climax: when asked, "So do you want to be an elf?" he responds, "I don't know, but I want the chance to find out"
  - And realizes that he can't have that unless others have it too (none of us are free unless all of us are free)
- Gran-Granna Tumbly (antagonist): traditionalist matriarch of Finner's family
  - Initially seems sympathetic, but "betrays" him by putting ideology ahead of empathy
  - Character arc: doesn't have the courage to change (opposite of Finner)
    - Reveal: has secretly made things all her life and hates herself for it
  - Has been supporting RoboSanta's experiments with robot elves
- Santa Hood: a santa who steals from the rich to give to the poor (doesn't need elves of her own)
  - Starts as one of Gran-Granna's agents, becomes an ally of Finner's
  - Wisecracking and beautiful (makes Finner acutely self-conscious)
  - Her decision to steal presents from people who don't need them for people who do rhymes with Finner's crisis
  - Her given name is Vidancia, but only Santa Greenwood calls her that
- Santa Greenwood: a forest santa who delivers gifts to trees
  - Big, gruff, straightforward (which isn't the same as simple-minded)
  - His decision to leave the sea for the forest rhymes with Finner's crisis
- Santa Hotep: a mummified santa who lives in a pyramid (and has no one left to deliver presents to, but doesn't mind)
  - Encountered briefly in Finner's travels
- Captain Clausbeard: a sea-going santa who is Santa Greenwood's father
  - Their relationship is difficult (santas aren't very good at talking about their feelings)
  - But Clausbeard gets along very well with Santa Hood (talk shop)
- RoboSanta (antagonist): inhabits a mechanized world
  - Has been experimenting with robotifying elves on Gran-Granna's behalf
  - "They are obedient"
  - Finner: "But doesn't that mean you're making things?"
  - RoboSanta: for the greater good
  - Metaphor for cis people making gender roles even more oppressive when threatened, and for hypocrisy
- Captain Alpha One: a partially robotified elf, captain of a world-hopping airship
  - Was one of Tumbly's elves, and one of the first experimented on by RoboSanta
  - Looks like Gran-Granna Tumbly (RoboSanta's idea of a joke)
  - An ally but not a friend
- Zubi: a young santa that Finner meets at The Building
  - Was also experimenting with making things, but has given up and is trying to be "normal"
  - Doesn't have the courage to escape with Finner when the time comes
- Grubby Santa: lives in the tunnels in a postapocalyptic world where Finner briefly finds refuge
  - "Am Rat Santa now. Filthy Santa. Not fit to deliver presents until whole world repaired, so I make repair."
  - Doesn't see the point of the fight between traditionalists and progressives
  - Finner's "drunken master"
- Santasaurus Rex: a dinosaur santa
  - The other santa in Grubby Santa's world
  - Santas made a portal to bring in help during the war with the elves
  - It didn't go well: S. Rex thinks everything smaller than it is a snack
  - FIXME: this doesn't work
- The Book
  - Narrates the warning at the start
  - The voice of the footnotes
  - Reappears to narrate the conclusion: if Finner can change, so can I and so can you
