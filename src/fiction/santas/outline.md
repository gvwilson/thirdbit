# All the Other Santas

-   *[All the Other Santas](../)* is a middle-grade story about a young santa who secretly wants to be an elf
    -   Being trans
    -   Revolutionaries of one generation become the reactionaries of the next
-   The story is a fast-paced adventure with occasional moments of character-driven heartbreak
    -   Chases, cartoon-ish battles, and sly asides
    -   Periodically interrupted by serious moments that show characters' pain and their desire for love and acceptance
-   Approximately 31,000 words

## Setting

-   There are many parallel worlds, each with its own santas and elves
-   Used to be that santas always married elves and vice versa
    -   Long struggle led to santa-santa and elf-elf relationships being accepted (ish)
-   Traditional division of labor is that elves make presents and santas deliver them
    -   Santas are socially dominant, elves are stay-at-home introverts
    -   Most people in the "gifting community" still believe this is how things ought to be
    -   But some (referred to as "flips") are now challenging this
-   Metaphors
    -   Same-role marriage is a metaphor for gay marriage / gay rights
    -   Role switching is a metaphor for trans rights
    -   Note: same-sex relationships are unremarkable in this world
-   Note also: santas use portals called "wherevers" to travel between worlds
    -   And within them to deliver gifts, although staunch traditionalists regard that as cheating

## Characters

-   Finner (protagonist): a young santa who secretly wants to make things
    -   Character arc: finds the courage to defy his family (particularly Gran-Granna Tumbly) and join the fight for flip rights
    -   He realizes that he can't have that unless others have it too: none of us are free unless all of us are free
-   Gran-Granna Tumbly (principal antagonist): traditionalist matriarch of Finner's family
    -   Character arc: doesn't have the courage to change (opposite of Finner)
    -   Her given name is Vidancia, but only Santa Greenwood calls her that
    -   Tumbly and her wife Shady Ann were famous campaigners for same-role relationships
    - Wife disappeared years ago, presumed lost
    -   Tumbly is now part of a public campaign against the flips
    - Hood and Greenwood are part of the "dirty tricks" arm of this campaign
    -   Secretly helping to kidnap flips for re-education at The Building
    - Hood and Greenwood don't know about this: finding out makes them change sides
-   Santa Hood (ally to foe): steals from the rich to give to the poor (so she doesn't need elves of her own)
    -   Wisecracking and beautiful (makes Finner acutely self-conscious)
    -   Her given name is Periwinkle, but only Santa Greenwood calls her that
    -   One of Gran-Granna's agents in her clandestine campaign against the flips
    -   She and Greenwood are a couple: they follow Tumbly because she made their relationship possible
-   Santa Greenwood (ally to foe to ally): a forest santa who delivers gifts to trees (soil, water, pruning)
    -   When someone says "it looks like gardening" his response is "where do you think gardeners learned it?"
    -   Big, gruff, straightforward (which isn't the same as simple-minded)
    -   His father (Clausbeard) never understood Greenwood's love for trees but accepted it
    - Greenwood's decision to leave the sea for the forest foreshadows Finner's crisis and makes him sympathetic to it
    - Contrasts with Gran-Granna Tumbly's refusal to accept Finner's differentness
    -   His real name is Steve (but that's only mentioned once)
-   Captain Clausbeard (part of Greenwood's story): a sea-going santa and Santa Greenwood's father
    -   Their relationship has always been difficult (pirates aren't very good at talking about their feelings)
    -   Made more difficult by the fact that Clausbeard sympathizes with the flips ("pirates aren't much for rules")
    -   But he has come to accept his son Greenwood for who he is
    -   Clausbeard gets along very well with Santa Hood (they talk shop)
-   Santa Hotep (role model of sorts): a mummified santa who lives in a pyramid
    -   Has no one left to deliver presents to, but finds it peaceful after thousands of years of delivery
    -   Secretly started making things for himself after his last elf died (the work reminds him of the elf)
    -   Represents elderly closeted queers who have come to accept themselves
    -   Helps Finner come to accept who he is
-   Zubi (contrasting path): a young elf that Finner meets at The Building
    -   Was secretly delivering presents, but has given up and is trying to be "normal"
    -   Unlike most inmates, wasn't abducted: turned himself in
    -   Doesn't have the courage to escape with Finner: instead, reveals Finner's first escape plan
    -   Despite that, Finner tries to help him escape again
-   Shady Ann (part of Tumbly's back story): lives underground in a frozen post-apocalyptic world
    -   Campaigned with Tumbly for same-role rights
    -   Returned to her world ("It's hell, but it's home, and people needed me")
    -   Had always made things, but started making more as her world grew more desperate
    -   Turns out Subway Santa is still alive, still making things
-   The Elfabot (part of Tumbly's back story): a robotic helper
    -   Shady Ann made it to help make and deliver presents (and because she missed her wife)
    -   That tipped Tumbly into her hardline anti-flip position
    -   The Elfabot makes forays into other worlds to get medicine, food, and what-not
-   Santazilla: a giant *santasaurus rex*
    -   Hunts for Shady Ann in the burned-out world
-   The Book
    -   Narrates the warning at the start
    -   The voice of the footnotes
    -   Reappears to narrate the conclusion: if Finner can change, so can I and so can you
