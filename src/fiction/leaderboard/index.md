"I don't work with musicians.
Or celebrity baristas, or virtuals.
You know that."

Bench grinned.
"Maybe this will change your mind."
She pulled a holo out of the sleeve of her suit jacket,
slid it across the black quartzite table,
and sat back looking smug.

I put down my coffee and picked it up.
"Turner,"
I said after a moment's unnecessary study.
"*Rain, Steam, and Speed*, mid 1840s.
It's beautiful."
I sighed as Bench's grin widened to show off slightly imperfect teeth.
"Let me guess—your noodle has it."

"He's not mine, and he's not a noodle.
He's just…new."
She waved a hand to excuse her client's youth.
"It showed up at an estate sale a few months ago,
and yes,
I made sure he hung it properly.
Just give him ten minutes,"
she wheedled as I open my mouth.
"Ten minutes,
and you can have as much time with it as you want."

I gave her a tired look.
"Excellent," she purred,
reaching for her tablet.
"He's not really a morning person, so how about—"

A hundred devices beeped, bleebled, or binged around us.
"Huh,"
Bench grunted,
turning her tablet to show me the news.
Vitaly Mendonça:
Brazilian,
sixty-four,
inherited a construction company after his father died (natural causes),
then made a fortune in remediation work.
He had been in and out of the Top Twenty for years.
A combination of fluctuating exchange rates
and an automatic contract renewal someone had overlooked
had catapulted him into the number one spot that morning.
His handler—a German whiz kid I'd met a couple of times—had been trying frantically to unload stuff since then,
but apparently it hadn't been enough.
A few minutes ago Senhor Mendonca had gone from
briefly being the richest person in the world
to permanently being dead.

I downed the last of my coffee and stood up.
"Put him in my calendar," I said as the buzz in the coffee shop resumed.
"Give me half an hour with the painting.
And Bench—he really better not be a noodle."

---

He was a noodle.
I got an hour with the Turner,
though,
which almost made the trip worthwhile.
It dropped out of sight in the early thirties
when English museums started putting their collections on "permanent loan"
to make ends meet.
It showed up at a sale in Italy a few years later,
then disappeared again until Guo Leji stopped being
Vice Premier of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress
(or so my tablet told me)
and started being dead.

I scrolled down,
filling time while my minidrone camera scanned the painting.
Guo's story was typical:
graft, bribes, fingers in too many pies, yadda bloody boo,
so tangled that even the best AI couldn't keep track of it.
Or maybe he didn't trust them and tried to juggle it all in his head.

The camera chimed softly to tell me it was done.
I plucked it out of the air and weighed it in my hand
as I gave the painting one last, long look.
Twenty terabytes wasn't an archival-quality scan,
but it would be good enough to train the AI
that was trying to teach me how to perform miracles like this.
I put the camera in its case,
put the case in my pocket,
and went to find Bench and her client.

Chibundu "Zeebop" Unigwe,
age twenty-seven.
Born in Lagos,
grew up in Accra and Grenoble,
started coding music in his teens,
had his first viral show at nineteen
and a string of others since then.
He was rich enough that he could buy half a floor in the independent half of Manhattan,
decorate it in blond pine,
and hang a few masterworks like the Turner,
but he wasn't even in the top hundred on the board.
There was no family wealth to complicate things,
and nothing to signal someone higher up might be using him as a lightning rod.

He bumped elbows with me
while Bench did something competent with a chrome Egyptian coffee set.
We made small talk for a few moments,
and then he asked the question everyone asks:
who did I think was responsible?
God?
Aliens?
Some kind of AI,
or the Israeli government in exile?

I shrugged.
"Doesn't matter," I said,
and it didn't,
at least not to me.
"What *matters* is transparency.
Anything you hold back or keep off the books is a risk."

He nodded.
"Of course.
I do have some thoughts about that.
Have you see this?"
He brushed the air backhand,
sending a clip to my tablet.

I heard Bench exhale as it opened on hers as well.
"I've seen it,"
I said flatly.
I hadn't,
but I'd seen bullshit like it a hundred times before.
"It's not reliable."

"But look at their research,"
Unigwe insisted,
clearly not used to being told he was wrong.
"In cases where there was no contract—"

"Contracts don't matter,"
I said.
"If whoever you give it to thinks they're supposed to give it back,
it counts as your money.
Even if they're planning to steal it.
Even if they *do* steal it.
With respect,
M'sieur Unigwe,
we've known that for years,
and there's no way around it."

Unigwe's jaw set.
"That is defeatist," he snapped.
From the way he said it
I could tell it was some fashionable memer's current explanation
for all the world's ills.

"I prefer to think of it as experienced," I said.
distracted by the smell of coffee.

I swiped Bench a surreptitious thumbs down.
She swiped me back a shrug.
She could bill the noodle for her time,
and the Turner meant I'd forgive her for wasting mine.
All that was left was some more small talk
and insincere promises to follow up later.

She called me again four days later.
My left arm ached from what my tablet told me was almost thirty-one hours of painting,
and four more people were dead:
a Texan property developer (number one spot, had been holed up in a bunker for the last few years),
a geriatric Arab prince who had "volunteered" to be the family's lightning rod (also number one),
a government minister from the Philippines (number five or number six, depending on whose model you used),
and a Papal banker who hadn't even been on the board, which caused a ten-second news flurry.
There had been other news too—another carbon sequestration agreement had been signed,
something called leishmaniasis had finally been eradicated,
yada yada yada—but I had ignored most of it.
Painting is more physically demanding than most people realize,
and doing the same strokes over and over with two kilos of haptic trainer on your arm
leaves you feeling like you've been trampled by an angry goat.

On the upside,
though,
I was still alive.
A flurry of offset trading the day the cardinal died
had briefly made me the fifty-fifth richest person in the world,
but the odds on that had seventeen zeroes between it and the decimal point,
so I hadn't lost any sleep.

"I have someone for you," she said without preamble.
"And before you ask, no, he's not a noodle.
He's *definitely* not a noodle."

"What's his art collection like?" I asked,
scowling at the soapsuds and lather I had inflicted on my canvas that morning.
Even with the AI nudging my arm,
I couldn't get the smudging right.

"He doesn't have one," Bench said.
And then she told me who the client was
and for a moment I forgot about my painting.

---

You've seen the video.
*Everyone* has seen the video:
fifty of the richest people in the world standing awkwardly in three rows
at the original United Nations building
while their spokesman begged for their lives.
It was thirty-three days since the first death—a trillionaire
who had parlayed lax regulation and cannibalistic business tactics
into the biggest fortune in history—and the pattern had become clear.
Every day,
one of them would die,
and the richer you were,
the greater the odds of it being you.

Nobody knew how or why.
Benevolent aliens try to save us from ourselves?
Some kind of artificial intelligence trying to do the same thing?
The Jews, the Communists, the CIA, the Illuminati,
a glitch in our simulation's source code—it didn't matter.
Every twenty-four hours,
one of them just…stopped.

So there they were,
the most powerful people on the planet,
offering to meet any reasonable set of demands.
That evening,
the Russian Minister for Economic Affairs collapsed mid-cocktail.
It turned out that she had been trying to find buyers
for the farms, factories, and banks she had inherited from her father,
but no one was buying,
not any more,
and she had refused to just give them away.

"They were cowards."
The voice from behind me was still strong,
even if its owner's body looked like a puppet made from old scraps of leather.
"They could all do the math,
but they were afraid to follow where it led."

"Unlike you,"
I said,
clasping my hands in front of me the way my third-grade teacher had taught me
before my forebrain could stop me.

An.ton grinned,
or perhaps just bared his teeth.
He had legally changed his name
to celebrate his first startup's IPO.
His lifechair made a barely audible hum as it rolled forward
across a dark wooden floor that was older than most countries.

He jerked his chin at the video frame that was showing the speech on a loop.
"Unlike me.
Half of them died within a month.
None of them lasted a year."

"But you did."
He didn't seem like the sort of person who bumped elbows,
so I unclasped my hands and put them in my pockets.
"You paid off the entire foreign debt of Costa Rica,
gave six billion euros' worth of food to climate refugee camps in the south of France,
and then poof—you disappeared."

His scowl deepened.
"I didn't disappear.
I just kept myself out of sight and out of mind."
He waved a petulant hand.
The wall beside me made itself transparent.
The hectares of bamboo outside were an almost ludicrous green.
"Couldn't stop myself from making money,
so every time I got into the red zone
I'd throw it at some godawful idiocy like this."

"Mm."
Once upon a time,
when we were a thing,
Bench used my "mm" as a ringtone.
She called it the Platonic ideal of noncommittal verbalizations.
"So how can I be of use?
You've lasted twenty years without the kind of service I provide.
I'm not sure how—"

"I want you to kill me,"
he said.
"I want you to talk to every lightning rod you know.
Hell, I want you to talk to the ones you *don't* know—
it'll be a chance to make some new friends.
And then I want you to have them dump every penny they've got on me,
all at the same time."

An.ton leaned forward,
his skeletal hands tight on the arms of his lifechair
and his eyes blazing.
"I don't care who's doing this.
I don't care why they're doing it or what they want from us.
You're going to make me as rich as the next hundred people on the planet put together,
and *then* they can fucking have me."

---

Arranging a death is surprisingly easy
when the intended victim is very rich and completely cooperative.
An.ton was a citizen of a little Pacific island nation
and whose current existence was mostly an accounting fiction.
Three different AIs confirmed that I couldn't be charged with murder under its laws,
though one did predict a case could be made for reckless endangerment.

Choosing a date was also simple.
The neurodegenerative disorder that had eaten away his muscle mass
was a result of an overly optimistic gene therapy "cure" for old age
he had spent one of his fortunes on in his forties.
His AIs had been charting its progression ever since,
and calculated a 98% probability that he had more than three months but less than six.

"So make it April first,"
he told me.
"Sundays are always slow days for news.
Maybe I'll give everyone something more interesting to talk about
than reforestation or UB fucking I."

I nodded but didn't say anything.
The more time I spent with him,
the more things I found myself not saying.
He was very intelligent,
very well informed,
and hated everything that had happened in the last two decades.
I got a lecture on the idiocy of rewilding the Great Plains,
and another on why banning private air travel
had been an infringement of fundamental human rights.

The hard part was convincing other lightning rods that this wasn't a joke or a hit.
The choice of date made the first part harder,
and as for the second…

"*Nein*,"
Joachim said flatly.
"Remember what happened with the Koreans?"

"That was completely different," I shot back.
"His kids aren't trying to bump him off.
He doesn't even *have* kids.
It's medically assisted—"

"*Nein*," Joachim repeated,
scratching at the piercing in his nose and then cutting the call.
His reputation had taken a hit after what had happened with Mendonça,
so I thought he'd be open to the idea.
I shrugged and pinged the next person on my list.

It took me a week to get nineteen people to say "yes".
My models said fourteen would be enough,
but everyone had their own formulas and hand-tuned AIs.
After a bit of debate and a lot of posturing,
we finally had a team—and some media attention.
I don't know who leaked what we were doing—for all I know
it was An.ton himself—but somehow word got out.
Stories with titles like "The Last Trillionaire Cashes In" started popping up,
and my status bot had to (politely) fend off thousands of queries a day.

And then a week before our chosen Sunday
it almost fell apart.
I don't know if Joachim regretted saying no
or was jealous of the attention we were getting
or was just a monumental fuck-up,
but somehow he got a sign wrong for a few crucial moments at just the wrong time.
Instead of offloading his clients' money in a hundred different ways
to keep them off the leaderboard,
his AIs sucked it all in.
For thirty-seven and a half seconds,
he owned more than the next three people on Earth put together.
Whoever or whatever was making decisions made it then,
and Joachim flatlined at his desk.

"Let me talk to them," Bench said.
We were spooned together on the couch in her apartment
listening to the near-hurricane outside
while a Bollywood remake of *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*
played silently on the wall.
She cupped my breast for a moment,
comfort rather than suggestion,
and sat up.
"Let me be your lightning rod, just this once."

I sat and listened as she did what she did,
flattering people and pointing out the holes in their arguments
and generally just getting them back in line.
"OK,
we'll start running sims tomorrow," she said
in a tone that implied she was summing up something they had agreed to
rather than making a decision.
"We'll check each other's models,
we'll try every one-in-a-billion scenario your AIs can think of.
And if we screw up, well…"
She grinned her famous grin and her avatar clapped mine on the shoulder.
"It's been nice knowing you."

---

I spent the last day of March painting.
Bench invited me to join her and one of her friend groups
try something called immersive gardening,
but was neither surprised nor disappointed when I shook my head.
"Don't second-guess yourself," she ordered sternly,
kissing me for emphasis
before climbing into the back of a putt-putt
with an actual human driver.

My parents were refugees.
So were the parents of pretty much everyone I knew until I was twelve.
They got as far as Canada,
but then there was a change of government
or a change of policy
or maybe there hadn't ever really been a plan or a home for them.
My *ummi* thought she was going to be a doctor in Toronto.
Instead,
she cleaned houses in the suburbs around Sudbury
while my *abbi* sorted trash instead of designing houses.
AIs could clean and sort better and faster than people,
but then what would newcomers like us do to earn citizenship?

When I was little,
I thought everyone had to wear a tracking bracelet.

Art was a way out.
If you wanted a picture,
you described it to an AI and poof,
there it was,
so having art stopped mattering.
*Artists*,
on the other hand,
remained scarce,
so billionaires and trillionaires started collecting and trading
people who could paint or sculpt.

My *abbi* could work miracles with a pencil and a piece of paper.
My *ummi* started leaving little sketches he had done
in the houses she cleaned.
"Oh, I am all sorry,"
she would say, flustered.
"It is my husband's.
He makes it for our daughter.
Thank you for finding it."

They talked sometimes about what they'd do if he was ever discovered,
but he never was.
Later,
when they got sick,
my *abbi* drew picture after picture of houses he had once hoped to build,
houses that could withstand the punishing heat
that had made home unliveable.

That morning,
after Bench left,
I pinned one of those drawings up on the wall,
prepped a canvas,
and started to paint.
I left the haptic trainer in its case.
I wanted to do this one.
It wouldn't be a Turner,
and I'd scrape the canvas clean when I was done,
but—

My tablet bleebled.
"Piss off," I said.
I was sure I had told it no interruptions.

It bleebled again.
"Come on, I know you're there,"
An.ton's voice said.

I let my breath out in a long hiss
and set my brush down very precisely on the palette I'd been preparing.
"Piss on.
Good afternoon, An.ton.
How can I help you?"

"Have you ever been in orbit?"
he asked.

*Of course not, and you know that,* I didn't reply.
"No."

"I have.
Four times.
The sex wasn't nearly as good as they promised,
but the view was…"

"Amazing?" I filled in when he paused.

"Just as disappointing," he snapped.
