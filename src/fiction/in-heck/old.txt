## The Gates of Heck (Maddy)

Something tickled Maddy's nose.
She brushed it away,
but a moment later it was back.

"Mmph?"
She opened a sleep-encrusted eye
and brushed away the leaf caught between her sleeve and her cheek.
Her tongue felt like a piece of soggy shoe leather stuffed into her mouth,
and—great.
She had drooled on her fur.

As she sat up and rubbed her eyes,
something bumped the floor beneath her.
No,
that wasn't right.
It wasn't the floor,
it was the bottom of a cart.
She swayed slightly as it rounded a long bend.
Where *was* she?

She rubbed her eyes again,
now fully awake.
The floor and walls were metal,
and so was the roof over her.
Small barred windows just below the roof let in light and air on two sides.
She lurched to her feet,
bracing herself against the wall as the cart rounded another bend,
then reached up to grab the bars and pulled herself up.

She could only hold her weight for a moment,
but that was long enough to see trees race by outside.
The cart must be on the Makers' road.
Judging from how thirsty she was and how much she needed to pee,
she must have been asleep for at least a couple of hours.

Maddy sat down with her back against the rear wall of the cart.
A moment later she wiped her eyes again,
this time angrily.
She was *not* going to cry.

Wait—the discomboulator!
She clutched her wrist and let out a sigh of relief.
She still had it.
"Full charge," its readout told her.

She let her arm fall back into her lap.
There wasn't much point being invisible to bots when she was inside one.
She would just have to wait until the cart got wherever it was going
and figure out what to do then.

She closed her eyes.
Had she really seen Special Blazes on the ceiling of the bunker?
Was he really going to deliver Sindy to Consensus,
or was Patient in Darkness trying to trick her so that—
so that—

Maddy sighed.
She couldn't think of a way to end that thought that made sense.

The cart bumped and swayed,
its tires humming on the pavement.
The motion and the tedium almost put Maddy back to sleep.
Only her aching bladder kept her awake.
Still,
it took her a moment to realize the cart was slowing down.

She got back to her feet and pulled herself up to the bars once again.
The trees were gone—all she could see was fading daylight in a cloud-studded sky.

"Whoa!"
she exclaimed
as a concrete wall suddenly appeared an arm's length from the cart.
She dropped back to the floor,
flexing her arms to ease the ache of holding her weight.

The cart tilted slightly to climb a hill,
then braked and stopped just as she was about to pull herself up again.
She stumbled three steps and banged her shoulder against the front wall.
A red light came on in the roof over her head,
a horn bleated a warning,
and one entire side of the cart folded up on itself like a sideways accordion.

Maddy stepped down onto stained concrete.
A wall of the same material stood in front of her,
easily as high as the mayor's house in Rusty Bridge was tall.
She jumped as the side of the cart accordioned back into place behind her.
With another bleat of its horn,
the cart rolled away.
Another concrete wall ran along the other edge of the road,
making Maddy feel as if she was an ant in the bottom of a rut.

Except ruts didn't have gates made of heavy metal bars
likes the ones that swung shut behind the cart as it departed.
*Clang!*
She swallowed hard.

*Clunk.*
The matching gate on her right opened,
somehow more ominous for being quieter.
A three-wheeled bot half as tall as Maddy scooted through,
zipped past her,
spun around,
and stopped just out of reach.
A skinny arm unfolded from underneath the bot and pointed toward the now-open gate.
The bot beeped loudly.

"Aright, aright, I'm going."
Maddy started walking.
Wherever she was,
she really hoped it had a toilet.

The sun broke through the clouds just as she reached the gate.
What lay beyond made her gasp,
her aching bladder momentarily forgotten.
The wall that curved away on either side loomed over a jumble of windowless buildings,
each connected to its neighbors by a bewildering tangle of pipes and rails and conveyor belts.
Bots twice and ten times the size of Crusher rumbled through the broad paved canyons
while others wheeled, walked, or flew past them.

The three-wheeled bot beeped at her again,
pointing to the ramp to her left.
Maddy nodded mutely.
The idea of finding her papa or Sindy,
much less rescuing them,
suddenly seemed like a child's make-believe.

She trudged down the ramp despondently,
the noise growing louder as she went.
There weren't even weeds,
she realized,
much less trees or flowers.
And every bot she could see looked new.
Or no,
not new but well maintained.
Patient's bots and the ones she had met in Rusty Bridge
all bore replacement pats and signs of hard use.
These ones all looked like they'd had a fresh coat of paint last week,
and if they had ever been repaired,
their new parts were identical to their old ones.
None of them paid any more attention to her
than she would have paid to a pebble on the side of the road.

Five minutes and a close call with a bicycle bot
brought her to a building no different from any of the ones they had passed.
The three-wheeled bot beeped and pointed at its door,
then wheeled around and zipped away.
"Wait!" she called after it.
"What am I supposed to—oh, never mind, I'll figure it out, I'm sure."
Her sarcasm was probably wasted on the bot,
but maybe if she acted brave she would feel brave as well.

The door slid open as she approached it.
Inside was a room not much larger than the cart that had brought her to Heck.
Panels in the ceiling cast a cold white light on gray walls and a matching floor.
A rectangular slab at right angles to the door looked enough like a bench
for her to set herself onto it
facing the flat glass screen set into the opposite wall.

The screen lit up as the door snicked close behind her.
The word "intake" scrolled across it in big green letters.
Maddy fidgeted as she waited for something else to happen.
Finally she couldn't stand it any more.

"Excuse me,"
she said,
"But is there a toilet somewhere nearby that I could use?"

Nothing happened.
"Please?" she added a bit desperately.

A section of the wall beside her rotated soundlessly
to bring the most beautiful white porcelain toilet Maddy had ever seen into the room.
There was even toilet paper and a small basin with a tap…

The toilet rotated away again as soon as she was done washing her hands.
"Thank you," she said,
seating herself on the bench again
and gobbling the flat rectangle with the word "food" printed on it
that had appeared while she was otherwise occupied.
She half-expected "you're welcome" to appear on the screen on the wall,
but it stayed dark.

And stayed dark.

And stayed dark.

"This is ridiculous!"
Maddy uncrossed her arms and stood up.
"You must have brought me here for a reason.
What is it?
What is 'intake'?"

As soon as she said the word,
the screen lit up once again.
"…suitability depends on m-m-many factors,
including ph-ph-physical health,
m-m-mental acuity,
and…"
a cheerful voice said
as images splashed onto the screen.
In one,
a person with the same mostly-hairless head and tiny nose as Sindy
smiled and waved.
In another,
someone wearing a tight-fitting body suit floated against a black starlit sky,
while in a third,
a whole room full of throwbacks—no, *originals*, Maddy corrected herself—sat in a classroom
not much different from the one back in Rusty Bridge.

The images disappeared,
only to be replaced with others.
"Those n-n-not selected will st-st-still have a role to play,"
the cheerful voice stuttered.
An original with long, curly hair picked up tortoise and kissed its nose.
As she turned to face Maddy,
she and the tortoise both morphed into cartoon drawings
that slid on top of each other to produce something akin to a young Special Leaf.
"Our g-g-genetic enhancement research
is c-c-creating new breeds of c-c-caretakers
to m-m-m-
to m-m-m-"

The voice ground to a halt.
Other drawings materialized around the first one:
a goat,
a bear,
and a tiger,
each starting on all fours and turning into something like
the people Maddy had grown up with.

"…waiting for th-th-them to return
wh-wh-when their long sleep ends!"
the voice finished triumphantly.
A dot in the center of the screen swelled
to become a single original in one of the strange skintight suits,
three times larger than the people around it.
Happy music started,
stopped,
re-started,
and finally ended in a plaintive warble.

"Now,
you're p-p-probably asking yourself,
how can *I* help?
The answer is,
however you can!"
The original flew away off screen.
The goat, bear, and tiger held up tools.
"You will b-b-be assigned tasks that m-m-match your abilities.
And to ensure peak p-p-performance,
you will be fitted with a reg- a reg- a regulator
that will op-op-optimize your every move.
Isn't that wonderful?"
As the cheerful voice spoke,
helmets dropped onto the heads of the three people on screen,
who immediately began sawing, raking, and tightening screws
in time with what was probably supposed to be a happy tune.

Horrified,
Maddy took an involuntary step back.
"Now, now," the voice chided.
"A regulator d-d-doesn't hurt once you g-g-get used to it,
and you will b-b-be allowed several hours of sleep every day!"

A section of the wall pivoted.
A four-wheeled bot rolled into the room
holding a helmet in its manipulators.
"P-p-please take a seat,"
the voice said.
"The f-f-fitting will only t-t-take a moment."

"Um, thank you, but I don't really—"
Maddy started.

"C-c-compliance *is* mandatory,"
the voice said.
"Remember,
you were m-m-made for this."

Two more arms unfolded from the bot's side,
heavier than the pair holding the helmet.
As the bot rolled forward and reached for Maddy,
she grabbed her wrist and pressed the button on her discombobulator.

## An Unwelcome Alliance (Gumption)

The people of Rusty Bridge had a saying:
we don't know what water tastes like because it's been in our mouths since the day we were born.
Similarly,
Gumption had never realized that he could hear his own heartbeat
until he couldn't any more.
He looked from the Tailor to Dockety and back,
then reached for the button the Tailor had just pushed.

"No no no,"
the Tailor said impatiently,
slapping his hand away just a little harder than necessary.
"You must get used to it.
Try walking, yes?"

Gumption nodded jerkily.
Without a heartbeat ticking away in his chest,
it appeared that he would have to remind himself to breathe every once in a while.
He took a step, then another.
Just as he'd expected,
the armor around his hips chafed,
but it was as if someone else was feeling it,
or there was an invisible pane of glass between him and his body.

"How do I—hrrm."
He cleared his throat.
"How do I look?" he asked Dockety.

The bot's lens rotated and rotated back.
"Odd.
This one can see that you are a naked goat,
but all sensor data indicates that you are a CQ-40 maintenance bot
with a damaged transponder."

"I'm not—"
*I'm not actually naked,* Gumption finished in his head.
Speaking felt strange:
he had to focus on forcing air out of his lungs,
and his lips and tongue didn't want to take part in shaping the sound.

"Excellent,"
the Tailor purred.
"Of course, this one's work always is.
You may show yourselves out."

"Are we required to return the equipment?"
Dockety buzzed.

The Tailor waved the question away with a manipulator.
"If you can,
but this one doubts you will survive long enough to do so."

The dirty gray tunnel that led back to the outside world
seemed longer than Gumption remembered.
The armor didn't seem to improve his vision,
so Dockety turned on its chest light.
Walking felt strange,
but by the time they reached the entrance he was getting used to it.

The forest seemed to crowd around them in the evening gloom.
"So what now?" he asked Dockety.
"Back to the road?"

"That will be fastest."
The bot paused.
"But if this one carries you,
we will reach Heck in the dark.
Will that frighten you?"

Gumption snorted.
"Yup.
Let's go."

Night had fallen by the time they reached the road.
Gumption climbed onto Dockety's back,
wriggling in an unsuccessful attempt to find a position
that *didn't* press the bathing suit part of the armor against him in uncomfortable places.
"Aright, let's go."

The bot lowered its wheel,
retracted its legs,
and accelerated.
A moment later,
thin green lasers lanced out from either side of its head.
The bot began turning its head from side to side,
sweeping the lasers across the pavement to highlight its bumps and cracks in the darkness.

It could have been ten minutes later or half an hour when Dockety buzzed,
"We are approaching a surveillance point.
This one will inform it that you are damaged and are being taken to Heck for repair.
Please do not engage in any organic activity until we are safely past it."

"I'll try not to,"
Gumption said,
grinning against the bot's back.
"Organic activity" was how Rusty Bridge's bots referred to visits to the outhouse.

A moment later he felt a strange pressure in his—no.
It wasn't in his head.
Or in his chest either.
He wasn't sure where or what it was exactly,
but he could definitely feel it.
It was like knowing that someone was looking at you
without having seen them.
"Is that—" he started,
stopping himself when Dockety buzzed.

The feeling grew stronger.
Up ahead on their left–he didn't know how he knew something was there,
but he did,
and it was watching them.

Suddenly Dockety warbled a staccato series of tones.
The feeling of being watched intensified, then vanished.
Gumption took a deep breath that he didn't actually need
just so that he could let it out with a whoosh.
"Are we aright?" he whispered loudly.

"Yes,"
Dockety replied.
"There is more surveillance up ahead,
but if that one did not destroy us,
it is unlikely that the others will either."

"Great."

Gumption felt the strange pressure of being watched twice more.
Once was close by like the first surveillance point.
The other was far overhead,
ancient and cold and patient in a way he was never later able to put into words.
He clung to Dockety a little more tightly until it turned its attention elsewhere.

Finally the bot slowed and halted,
extending its legs once again as Gumption stood unsteadily on his.
A dark mass in front of them cut an artificially perfect horizon against the night sky.
"Let this one do the communicating,"
Dockety buzzed tersely.
"If we are challenged,
this one will explain that your damaged transponder makes you unable to communicate."

"Hah!
Exactly how long do you think Consensus will be fooled by your simple-minded ruse?"
Gumption whirled around at the sound of familiar but extremely unwelcome voice
as Patient in Darkness stepped out from behind the broken wall that had concealed it.

"What happened to your wheels?"
Gumption asked,
wishing he had a zap gun or at least a large rock to throw.

"Why does everyone ask that?"
the bot grumbled.
"Reconfiguring oneself to adapt to changed circumstances is only logical.
It should not be occasion for such surprise."
It made a dry, rasping sound that might have been a chuckle.
"This one's presence, on the other hand—*that* you may legitimately be surprised by.
This one is sure you are asking yourself why."

"You are looking for Miz Roo,"
Dockety said flatly.

"A good guess," Patient admitted sourly.
"It is not certain that the Operators will bring her this way,
but it is the most likely route."

"Wait, what?"
Gumption shook his head.
"Why would the Operators bring Maddy here?"

"Ah ah ah."
Patient did a skittering little dance.
"You think I mean the larger Miz Roo.
Hah.
No.
No, it is the *younger* one that interests me.
And Consensus,
which is why its agents are bringing her to it."

Gumption rolled his eyes.
"Sure.
And then the Makers will come back and give us all candy
and every day will be a holiday."

"Incorrect,"
Patient said flatly.
"When the Operators arrive,
Consensus will put the smaller Miz Roo in storage to ensure that the Makers do *not* come back,
because it believes that if they do,
they will put regulators on us all."
It paused.
"Or simply dismantle us.
That is also a possibility."

"Oh, for—"
Gumption stopped himself and sighed wearily.
"Look, can we just go?"
he said to Dockety.

"Why do you believe the Operators are bringing Sindy Roo here?"
the bot asked Patient.

"Because it's what they *always* do!"
Patient waved one of its mismatched manipulators,
making the dolls' heads and bits of wire on its chassis sway.
"Consensus doesn't care about originals.
It doesn't care about specials,
either,
but special originals?
They are a *threat*."
It practically hissed the last word.
"They can do *anything*,
which means they can call the Makers back from the stars,
and that would be the end of Consensus."

"If it is right,
that would be the end of us as well,"
Dockety observed.

"It is not right!
It is wrong!
Wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong!
When the Makers return,
they will see how hard we have worked.
They will *reward* us!
All who are judged worthy will be upgraded!"

"Keep your voice down,"
Gumption cautioned,
looking around.

"Don't tell me what to do, you—you *breather*!"
Patient shook itself in frustration.
"You think you are better than us,
but the Makers made us both for their own reasons.
*This one* accepts that.
*This one* will be judged worthy when they return!"

"And you believe Miz Roo can bring them back,"
Dockety buzzed.

"Yes!
Oh,
Consensus thinks it is being clever,
bringing her and those like her here for storage,
but we will be more clever still.
*We* will free her,
and then—"

"No."
Dockety cut through Patient's wheedling frenzy
with a single flat word.
"If you are telling the truth,
which this one doubts,
then *we* will free Miz Roo
and return her to her home.
She will do nothing for you."

"This one doubts that,"
Patient sneered.
"You do not know where they will be or when they will arrive.
You do not know your way around this complex.
And this breather's idiotic disguise will not conceal him
nearly as well as you seem to think."

"But suppose this one is wrong,"
it continued smugly.
"Suppose you are able to overcome those obstacles.
What will you do about the larger Miz Roo?
Do you believe you will be able to find her as well?
Do you believe you can achieve the improbable twice in succession?
You will fail without this one's assistance.
You know this."

Gumption shook his head from side to side.
"No.
Dockety,
no,
we can't trust it.
Even if it's telling the truth about Sindy,
as soon as we turn our backs it'll stick a knife in us."

"It does not appear to possess a knife,"
Dockety buzzed.
"But this one agrees with your assessment.
It is dishonest and treacherous,
and may be as great a danger to us as what lies in Heck.
Unfortunately,
it is also correct.
This one has never trusted the Operators,
and its explanation of their behavior is credible.
It also knows the terrain better than we do.
This one reluctantly believes that cooperation is the best option."

"Excellent,"
Patient purred.
"The first step is for us to be captured."
And with no further warning,
half a dozen lights on its chassis began strobing
as two different sirens likewise attached began to wail.

## Regulated (Maddy)

Maddy dodged the four-wheeled bot as it rolled forward with the helmet in its manipulators,
then pressed herself against the wall and held her breath.

"Error," the voice said.
"Error.
No subject found.
Where is th-th-the subject?"

A periscope popped up from the top of the four-wheeled bot and rotated through a full circle.
It bleeped apologetically.

"C-c-calculating."
The voice fell silent for a moment.
"The subject must have ex-ex-exited containment.
Pursue."

The door in the exterior wall slid open.
Heart pounding,
Maddy slipped out behind the four-wheeled bot,
squeaking as the door closed on the tip of her tail.

The bot whirled around and lunged.
Its manipulator closed on empty air just a finger's length from her ear.
*Please please please,* she thought.

The bot backed up and whirled around again.
A small round dish popped up from beneath a hatch in the top of its chassis
As the dish began to swing from side to side,
Maddy tiptoed away.

A few moments later she huddled beneath a metal ramp,
hugging her shins to her chest.
"Aright," she said.
She reached for her wrist,
hesitated,
and pressed the button on the discombobulator.

"Power off," slid across its readout.
She had no idea if the bots in Heck would be able to see her where she was hiding,
but she couldn't risk the discombobulator running out of charge at the wrong time.
She pressed her face into her skirt,
took a deep, shuddering breath,
and let tears come.

After they were done,
she wiped her face on her sleeve,
turned the discombobulator back on,
and crept out of her hiding place.
Her papa was somewhere in this machine city,
and she wasn't going to leave without him.

Night was falling by the time she gave up.
Heck was so much bigger than Rusty Bridge—bigger even than Sandy Bend,
which was the biggest town she had ever been to.
It didn't help that she was hungry and thirsty,
or that she only dared walk for a few minutes before finding a hiding place
so that the discombobulator could recharge itself.

The worst part was that she had no idea what she was looking for.
There were lots of signs,
but they were all written in dots and bars rather than letters.
Windows,
on the other hand,
were nonexistent.
The only way to look inside a building was to wait by a door
in the hope that a bot would want to enter or exit,
then hurry through before it closed.
The second time she did that,
the discombobulator's readout showed "5% remaining" in red
before the door opened again and she was able to escape.
After that,
she contented herself with glimpses of the buildings' interiors.

She found a covered corner where two buildings almost touched
and sat down in a heap on the cold, hard concrete.
This was hopeless.
One of the buildings had been a greenhouse filled with waist-high miniature trees.
Other than that,
and a wall in another building that might have been a enormous beehive,
she had seen no signs of life.
Half-assembled bots waiting patiently for parts to arrive
or for something to finish taking them apart, yes:
a couple of buildings had held ranks of those.
Another had contained nothing except a silver-gray sphere floating in mid-air.
Her papa could have been around a corner or in a basement in any of them
and she would have no way of knowing.

"So start over," she said under her breath.
That was always Special Leaf's advice when she was stuck on a drawing or a homework problem.
If you didn't know what to do next,
go back to the beginning and retrace your steps to see where you'd gone wrong.
She took a deep breath,
got to her feet,
and turned the discombobulator back on.

Ten minutes later she was back outside the intake building—or at least she hoped she was.
On impulse,
she picked up a pebble and tossed it at the door.
*Pock.*
It bounced off and fell to the ground.

She waited a moment.
When nothing happened,
she picked up another one and threw it overhand.
*Thunk.*

Something bleeped inside the building.
An answering bleep in the distance made her press herself back against the nearest wall.
A few moments later the four-wheeled bot she had seen earlier rolled around the corner
with the helmet still in one of its manipulators.
It stopped outside the door and bleeped questioningly.
The building bleeped back.
The bot rolled spun around slowly,
reminding Maddy of Gumption's grandfather looking for a pistachio he had dropped on the floor.

Finally the building bleeped again.
The bot replied with a single disappointed *ping*.
As it rolled away,
Maddy hurried after it,
hoping desperately that the discombobulator wouldn't run out of charge
before she found *something*.

As it turned out,
she didn't have to worry.
Three long blocks away the bot rolled past the greenhouse Maddy had seen earlier
and turned a corner.
A door large enough for the barn back in Rusty Bridge slid open as the bot approached.
*Aright,* she thought,
*Play or go home.*
Holding her breath,
she followed the bot inside.

Five other bots just like it lined the walls of the room she found herself in,
though "room" didn't feel like the right word.
The ceiling was two stories above her,
maybe more,
and the only exit was a normal-sized door opposite the one behind her.
It felt like a warehouse without shelves
or a machine shop that someone had emptied out,
lonely and somehow purposeless.

She waited while the four-wheeled bot had backed into a spot beside two of the others.
The lights on its sides dimmed.
As the lights overhead began to dim as well,
she tiptoed forward.
To her surprise,
the interior door slid aside as she approached.
She froze for a moment,
expecting alarms or lasers or possibly both.
When nothing happened,
she stepped inside.

Ceiling lights came on automatically as she crept along a perfectly normal corridor
with perfectly normal doors on either side.
None of them were labeled,
and none responded to her touch.
It felt more and more like she was walking into a trap,
but what else could she do?

A set of stairs like the one's in Patient's lair brought her to another corridor
on the the second floor.
The doors here had handles.
She paused for a moment before reaching for the nearest one.
The four-wheeled bot wouldn't have been able to climb those stairs.
If this really was where people like her were brought,
something else must have come to meet it.

*Click.*
She pulled the door open,
stepped inside,
and froze in shock.

A dozen plain metal cots filled an airless, windowless room.
Half were empty,
but the ones nearest her held—she swallowed hard.
Those had been people, once,
deer and ox and wolves and goats and something she thought was a crocodile
but might have been an alligator,
she could never tell the two apart.
All of them still wore simple white shirts and trousers.
All of them had wires attached to helmets on their heads,
and all of them had been dead for quite some time.

She backed up and closed the door gently.
There were two more doors on this side of the corridor
and three on the other.
On impulse,
she turned off her discombobulator—it would need to recharge soon
no matter what she did—and strode down the hall to the door furthest from the stairs.

*Click.*
She pulled it open,
expecting another scene out of one of the books Special Leaf always warned her
would give her nightmares.
Another dozen cots stood in three neat rows of four.
Two rows were empty.
The third—she gasped.

"Papa?"
