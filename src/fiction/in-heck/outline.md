# In Heck

-   *[In Heck](../)* is the second book in a middle-grade trilogy that starts with *Maddy Roo* (synopsis below).
    -   Approximately 31,000 words
-   The story is a fast-paced adventure with occasional moments of character-driven heartbreak
-   Like all middles it is proving hard to write…

## Settings

-   Long ago, as the world was falling apart, humans created intelligent animals
    -   Human are now remembered and revered as "the Makers", but their nature and appearance has been forgotten
-   Different species of intelligent animals can interbreed, but tend to pair with the same species
    -   Almost all children take after a parent (no half-goat / half-lion hybrids)
    -   But a handful are "throwbacks" (a slightly derogatory term) or "originals" (more polite)
    -   Descriptions in the story make it clear to readers that these look human (though their contemporaries don't know that)
-   Some people called "specials" have the ability to control a few pieces of leftover tech
    -   Throwback specials can control *all* tech devices, which  makes them powerful and dangerous
-   The last humans put themselves in frozen sleep in an orbiting ark to wait for the world to heal itself
    -   Ever since, the bots they left behind have been patching and repairing themselves however they can
    -   They are not able to create new bots because they have no way to manufacture new "brains"
-   Most bots are part of a hive-mind Consensus
    -   The only ones with unique personalities are those cut off from Consensus (accidentally or deliberately)
    -   These "free bots" (polite term) or "rogues" (less polite) fear being pulled back into Consensus and losing their individuality
-   Bots and people mingle uneasily
    -   When they do, bots usually have second-class social status
-   The Operators are peacekeepers (or vigilantes, depending on your point of view)
    -   They keep people safe from outlaws and rogue bots
    -   But their secret purpose is to keep watch on throwback specials, who might be able to awaken the sleeping Makers
    -   Neither Consensus nor the few people who know the truth about the Makers want the Makers to return
-   Notable places
    -   Rusty Bridge: a town of about a thousand people
    -   Bots' End: a small bot encampment taking shape near Rusty Bridge
    -   Heck: a bot "city"
        -   The story reveals that it was the base from which the Makers' ark was launched
        -   Consensus bots are still running experiments there in automated laboratories because their programming tells them to
    -   The Mire: a large, polluted swamp between Rusty Bridge and Heck
        -   Old bunkers and watch towers can be found in it and nearby
        -   An old highway referred to as the Makers' Road runs along its edge
    -   Sandy Bend: a larger town two days away
        -   It is mentioned several times but none of the action occurs there

## Previous Events

The story takes place in a world of anthropomorphic animals and patchwork robots.
Its protagonist, Maddy,
is a 13-year-old kangaroo whose younger sister Sindy is a "throwback" with no fur, scales, or tail.
(The description of Sindy make it clear to readers that she looks human,
but the characters in the book don't know what that means:
for them, humans are a half-forgotten legend.)
Maddy and Sindy's father was kidnapped by a raiding band of bots two years before the story starts.
They and their mother have struggled to make ends meet since then.

The story begins with Maddy and a goat boy named Gumption having a run-in with the town bullies.
As Maddy and Gumption walk home afterward they see some broken bits of tech floating downriver.
While fishing it out,
they encounter a damaged bot named Dockety.
The bot's regulator is broken,
which allows it to reveal that rogue bots are about to raid Rusty Bridge again.

Maddy and Gumption rush back to town to warn everyone.
The raiders are driven off,
but manage to grab Sindy and the two bullies.
Maddy teams up with the rescued bot to get her sister back.
They catch up with the raiders and free the prisoners,
but Maddy, Sindy, and Dockety are left stranded in a dangerous swamp called the Mire.
They take refuge in an abandoned bunker,
only to discover that it is the lair of a mad bot named Patient in Darkness,
who is masterminding the raiding parties as part of its campaign
to prove its worth to the Makers.

Maddy, Sindy, and Dockety escape by bolting a flying suit onto Dockety.
They get back to town just moments ahead of another band of raiders.
After the townspeople drive off the raiders,
Maddy realizes that she knows how to break Patient's hold on them.
She uses the flying suit to return to the bunker and frees Patient's minions,
but Patient escapes.
As the story ends,
Dockety reveals that Maddy's father may be alive as a prisoner in the bot city of Heck.

    -   Consensus: "Central communications hub - without it, we become our component parts"
-   Gumption breaks in

### 16 (Gumption)

-   Goals:
    -   Battle with the Operators
-   Repeat the conversation of the previous chapter from Gumption's PoV (watching from outside)
    -   Gumption: "What can we do?"
    -   Patient (with relish): "We can triumph!"
    -   Takes a random piece off itself and hands it to Gumption: "Use this"
    -   Gumption: "What does it do?"
    -   Patient: "Nothing, but they do not know that"
    -   Then it freezes (becomes unresponsive)
-   Gumption breaks in
    -   Tries to sound cocky as he reassures Maddy that everything's going to work out
    -   Shows the courage/resolve that he's always wanted
    -   Notices that Sindy has regained consciousness
-   Maddy and the Operators are all confused by Gumption's appearance
    -   Gumption continues bluffing, dropping heavy hints that Sindy should do something
    -   **Consensus: "Why can we not hear you?"**
-   Thoughtful shoots Patient's random piece of gear out of Gumption's hands
    -   Blazes: "Can't have you telling tales"
    -   Starts to fire up his tech to immolate Gumption
    -   The bots in the room simultaneously speak in Patient's voice: **"We… can… triumph!"**

### 17 (Maddy)

-   Goals:
    -   Action!
-   The bots attack the Operators
-   Gumption tries to help Maddy
    -   **Pulls her out of her chair - she regains control of her body**
    -   She makes a scathing comment about Gumption's "bathing suit"
    -   **Gumption's reply is oddly calm (still no heartbeat / muted feelings)**
    -   Uses her discombobulator to "hide" herself long enough to reach Sindy
    -   Sindy tells Maddy to leave her in her chair: she needs to help Consensus
    -   Patient: "Consensus is no more. There is only _me_."
    -   Sindy: "We'll see about that!"
-   Three-way fight (action takes up most of the chapter)
    -   Gumption is trying to stop Blazes and Thoughtful from shooting Sindy
    -   Bots are trying to stop the Operators
    -   Patient and Consensus are fighting for control of the bots (which speak in both their voices alternately)
    -   Maddy is yelling but cannot get out of her chair
-   All looks hopeless until Dockety arrives

### 18 (Gumption)

-   Goals:
    -   Patient's "death"
    -   Operators are defeated
    -   Dockety discovers it is strong enough to resist Consensus
    -   Protagonists escape from Heck with Papa Roo and Sindy
    -   Gumption and Maddy finally get together
-   Dockety throws itself in front of Sindy to save her from Blazes' blast
    -   Echo of Leaf's earlier sacrifice
-   Enraged, Sindy turns on all of the machines in the lab
    -   They speak with *her* voice as they seize Blazes and Thoughtful
-   We hear Sindy start to lose control
    -   And then Patient's voice comes through again: **"I did it! I did it!"**
    -   **"All the machines" that Sindy turned on included the control for the antenna on top of the building**
    -   Consensus starts to dissolve **(Its last word is, "Finally…")**
    -   And then Patient realizes that it is dissolving as well
    -   **Will not live to enjoy its victory, but it is still a victory (final villain monologue)**
-   Sindy passes out
-   Mouse jump-starts Dockety
-   **Maddy: "We have to get out of here!"**
    -   **Gumption still feels indifferent and lethargic**
    -   **Maddy kisses Gumption**
    -   **Gumption feels his heart start beating again**

### 19: Epilog (both PoV)

-   Goals:
    -   Happy ending that sets up the final book
-   On the Roos' porch
    -   Brief recap of their trip home from Heck
    -   Papa Roo is still fuzzy but getting better
    -   **Special Leaf is still alive, but not well enough to join them**
    -   Dockety and Crusher are adopting/upgrading Mouse

    -   Suspicious that Bee Six Vee is now living in Bots' End

-   Sindy says she feels a bit sorry for Patient
-   And then a star begins to descend from the sky
    -   Papa Roo speaks: **"They are awake. They are returning. The Makers are coming."**
