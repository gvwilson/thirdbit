    -   Show the tension between Maddy's ambitions and her sense of responsibility
    -   Hint at Gumption's PTSD and self-doubt, and at their complicated feelings for each other
    -   Show the tension between the bots and the villagers
-   Open with Maddy waiting for mail
    -   Show her sketching (and her hopes for it)
    -   Conversation with Mayor Lupus and Miz Nabbles shows anti-bot prejudice among some villagers
-   Gumption arrives
    -   Conversation between him and Maddy shows the strain in their relationship
        -   Foreshadow the romantic sub-plot
    -   And hints at Sindy's training with Special Leaf
        -   Foreshadow her special powers
-   Able arrives with mail
    -   Mention that he hitched himself to the cross-country wagon for most of the journey
        -   Foreshadow him hauling the wagon for Sindy's trip
    -   That a few others got off and are coming into town behind him
        -   Foreshadow arrival of Operators
    -   And that the wagon will be back in a couple of days for the return trip
        -   Foreshadow using it for trip with Sindy
-   Maddy gets a letter, but Dockety arrives with Bluster and Bravo in tow before she can open it
    -   Their version (obviously a lie): they were gathering evidence that the bots are arming themselves
    -   Dockety's version: they were caught stealing
    -   **But** Dockety confirms to Mayor Lupus that the bots have weapons
-   *Therefore* Mayor Lupus tries to find balance by sending them both on their way
    -   Miz Nabbles an excuse for anti-bot remarks
    -   More tension between Gumption (trying to be reasonable) and Maddy (strong opinions)

    -   Got off the wagon earlier to check out Bots' End
-   *Therefore* Mayor invites the Operators to the mayor's house to talk about it

        -   Holographic tech (foreshadow its use in Heck)
-   Maddy opens her letter
    -   Her drawing is going to be published by the newspaper

    -   Reveal that Gumption warned Dockety of Bluster and Bravo's plan
    -   And that Dockety is trying to find out if Papa Roo is still alive

    -   Show Special Blazes' zealotry
-   Maddy and Sindy arrive late at the town's one-room school
    -   Maddy just wants a normal day
-   *But* Special Blazes and Thoughtful have come to talk to the students
    -   *Therefore* most students are excited (including Gumption)
    -   Maddy is determined not to be (which causes friction with Gumption)
    -   She points out that their bot isn't with them (which makes Gumption feel a bit uncomfortable)
-   One of the children asks about Meribeth Bear
    -   *Therefore* Special Blazes says that they've parted ways amicably
    -   *But* Thoughtful looks uncomfortable
    -   *Therefore* Thoughtful suggests a demonstration to forestall further discussion
-   Blazes speaks to Maddy as the other children head into the playground
    -   He is about increased activity in Heck since her adventure: says it's why they've come to Rusty Bridge
    -   He wants her to spy on Dockety

    -   *Therefore* he drops a few hints about Special Leaf
-   Gumption intercepts Maddy as she leaves the school house (he was listening from the rafters)
    -   He tries to be "reasonable" about her spying on Dockety

    -   Is gravely injured

### 4: Keep Her Safe (Gumption)

-   Goals:
    -   Hint that the Operators have a dark purpose
    -   Gumption picks the wrong side (so he needs to redeem himself later)
    -   Motivate Maddy and Gumption stowing away
-   *Therefore* Gumption and Maddy go to see Special Leaf at Doc Whinny's clinic
    -   *Therefore* Leaf is very weak, but warns them that Sindy is in danger from the Operators
    -   Gumption misunderstands and thinks Leaf means retribution
    -   Leaf: "No, they'll take her. You mustn't let them… take her… Not again…" and passes out

    -   Gumption intervenes as Maddy loses her temper
    -   Maddy snaps at him: "Is there anything you *will* stand up for?"
    -   You, he thinks, but doesn't say out loud because she has already stormed off
-   *Therefore* Gumption pulled in as witness by Mama Roo, Mayor Lupus, and Special Blazes
    -   Grilled on what Sindy can do
    -   Maddy has clammed up
    -   Special Blazes: "can't help her if we don't know what help she needs"
    -   Gumption reluctantly admits that he has seen Sindy use tech before
-   *Therefore* Special Blazes decides that they'll be taking Sindy to the Operators' headquarters at Sandy Bend
    -   *But* Mama Roo objects, and so does Mayor Lupus
    -   Special Blazes applies pressure on the mayor ("lots of folk have questions about how close you are to those bots")
    -   Mayor Lupus bridles at the threat, but eventually gives in
-   *Therefore* Gumption visits Bots' End that evening
    -   Helps clean Crusher
    -   Talks to Dockety, who suggests Gumption enrol in mechanics' school in Sandy Bend
    -   See Gumption's self-doubt
