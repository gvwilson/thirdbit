# In Heck

-   *[In Heck](../)* is the second book in a middle-grade trilogy that starts with *Maddy Roo* (synopsis below).
    -   Approximately 31,000 words
-   The story is a fast-paced adventure with occasional moments of character-driven heartbreak
-   Like all middles it is proving hard to write…

## Critique

-   **"Therefore" and "however" instead of "and then"**
-   It's too short (26730 words vs. 31331, so shortfall of 5000 words or 3+ chapters)
-   The ending is too long
    -   The final confrontation in the lab should be two chapters instead of three
-   Having both the discombobulator *and* the suit of armor is too much
    -   Should only have one maguffin per story
    -   And neither is used
-   The zap gun is introduced but not used
-   Don't make enough of Special Leaf being injured
-   Gumption's character isn't properly developed
    -   Don't see him building self-confidence
-   Maddy's corresponding character development isn't clear either
    -   Don't see her feelings of guilt about her father's capture
    -   Or her realizing that she doesn't have to solve the world's problems
-   Maddy and Gumption stowing away without saying goodbye to Sindy isn't plausible
    -   Need to get them in the wagon *after* a tearful farewell
    -   But keep the scene of them sleeping side by side
    -   Maybe one night on the road to stretch out the journey to the Observatory?
-   Dockety's struggle with Central is unclear
    -   No one will understand the stakes or its triumph
    -   Should find a way to re-introduce its use of "I" as a sign of growth
-   The Operators are left hanging at the end
    -   Re-introduce Meribeth as Blazes' former partner (hint that she got cold paws)
    -   Show Thoughtful's qualms about turning Sindy over to Central
        -   Her first time doing this?
        -   Or will it be more effective if it's her second?
    -   Bee Six Vee joining the free bots is unclear and unmotivated
-   The free bot community around the Tailor is introduced and discarded
    -   Need them to reappear somehow
    -   Does Bee Six Vee join them to free itself from the Operators?
-   Mouse's adoption by Dockety and Crusher is unclear
-   What happens to the other special originals?
    -   And the other prisoners?
    -   Is rescuing them why Gumption goes back to the Tailor's community?
    -   Does this lead to another conflict with Special Blazes?
-   Not clear that Patient is destroyed at the end
    -   Does it need to be?
-   Central's desire to end itself isn't presented clearly
    -   Also unclear that it achieves this
-   Why would Central fill Heck with holograms?
    -   Or are the Operators behind it all and Central is their servant?
    -   Or are the Operators keeping Central occupied with special originals (feeding the addiction)?
-   Need a resolution with Miz Nabbles
-   Need to do something with Bluster and Bravo
-   Need to resolve Maddy's picture in the newspaper
    -   And Gumption deciding to go to trade school
    -   He's going away, but that's OK because they both know they've started something
-   Does Mouse become Sindy's new best friend at the end?
-   What happens to Able in the end?
    -   Friendship with Bee Six Vee leads to the latter turning?
-   Three-way fight at the Observatory isn't clear

## Solutions

-   Have one of the school children ask about Meribeth Bear
    -   Blazes says she's gone off to do new things, but Thoughtful is every bit as much a hero
    -   Use this as a lead-in to the staged fight
-   Gumption and Maddy go to see Special Leaf
    -   He is very weak, but warns them that Sindy is in danger if she goes with the Operators
    -   Reveals a bit of his own dark past before passing out
    -   Awkward scene with Miz Nabbles as they leave (she always knew there was something off about that…odd girl)
-   Tearful farewell followed by Dockety helping them stow away on the road
    -   Add a mention of Miz Nabbles being there to sniff at Sindy's departure, and Mama Roo's angry reaction
    -   Mad race through forest trails to get to where the wagon is blocked by Crusher and other bots doing road work
    -   Bluster and Bravo are watching, hoping to join the Operators
    -   Gumption uses the zap gun on them, is chewed out by Maddy
        -   Reasoning: if Dockety uses it, there will be hell to pay
-   The Observatory is the second day, not the first
    -   Maddy can lie there and hear Sindy cry quietly because she's alone and scared
    -   Use this to reveal Maddy's guilt about her father and her belief that she has to fix the world
    -   The Operators send Able off to take its turn recharging
    -   Show Thoughtful's misgivings (and Bee Six Vee's - turns out it has a voice after all)
    -   Mention Meribeth bear again: Blazes says she was a good fighter but not all the fights are on the outside
-   Fix the three-way fight at the Observatory
    -   Have Sindy kidnapped, then other bots re-kidnap her, but she's dropped in the muddle
    -   Maddy is taken while trying to protect her
-   See Patient raging at/punishing the flyer that took her
-   Tailor comments on how hard it is to hide someone from bots
    -   Foreshadows Maddy's discombobulator being fake
-   The Tailor refers to "its friend"
    -   Dockety doesn't understand what it means at the time
    -   Later reveal that the Tailor is trying to help Central shut down
-   Make more of Gumption fooling Patient with his armor
    -   The armor is damaged by Special Blazes in the lab fight, which reveals Gumption to Central and Patient alike
    -   An "uh oh" moment
-   Central refers to itself as "these"
    -   Keep Gumption's slip-up
    -   Have both Dockety and Patient react to his use of the pronoun
    -   When Patient triumphs, it refers to itself as "I"
-   Before the lab fight, Central reveals that it is trying to shut itself down
    -   Security protocols permit unavailable units to be replaced temporarily with holograms
    -   But no specification of how long "temporary" is
    -   Hoped that if there were few enough bots, its consciousness would disappear
    -   Allowed those that needed repair to "escape"
    -   "It is a better future than servitude"
-   End scene is Bee Six Vee and Thoughtful saying goodbye at the Roos
    -   "Folks from Sandy Bend are helpin' the others you found in Heck"
    -   "I imagine there's a lot of raised voices at headquarters in Sandy Bend right now"
    -   Special Leaf is there
    -   Mention Miz Nabbles being put in her place when the other prisoners arrive from Heck

## Settings

-   Long ago, as the world was falling apart, humans created intelligent animals
    -   Human are now remembered and revered as "the Makers", but their nature and appearance has been forgotten
-   Different species of intelligent animals can interbreed, but tend to pair with the same species
    -   Almost all children take after a parent (no half-goat / half-lion hybrids)
    -   But a handful are "throwbacks" (a slightly derogatory term) or "originals" (more polite)
    -   Descriptions in the story make it clear to readers that these look human (though their contemporaries don't know that)
-   Some people called "specials" have the ability to control a few pieces of leftover tech
    -   Throwback specials can control *all* tech devices, which  makes them powerful and dangerous
-   The last humans put themselves in frozen sleep in an orbiting ark to wait for the world to heal itself
    -   Ever since, the bots they left behind have been patching and repairing themselves however they can
    -   They are not able to create new bots because they have no way to manufacture new "brains"
-   Most bots are part of a hive-mind Central
    -   The only ones with unique personalities are those cut off from Central (accidentally or deliberately)
    -   These "free bots" (polite term) or "rogues" (less polite) fear being pulled back into Central and losing their individuality
-   Bots and people mingle uneasily
    -   When they do, bots usually have second-class social status
-   The Operators are peacekeepers (or vigilantes, depending on your point of view)
    -   They keep people safe from outlaws and rogue bots
    -   But their secret purpose is to keep watch on throwback specials, who might be able to awaken the sleeping Makers
    -   Neither Central nor the few people who know the truth about the Makers want the Makers to return
-   Notable places
    -   Rusty Bridge: a town of about a thousand people
    -   Bots' End: a small bot encampment taking shape near Rusty Bridge
    -   Heck: a bot "city"
        -   The story reveals that it was the base from which the Makers' ark was launched
        -   Central bots are still running experiments there in automated laboratories because their programming tells them to
    -   The Mire: a large, polluted swamp between Rusty Bridge and Heck
        -   Old bunkers and watch towers can be found in it and nearby
        -   An old highway referred to as the Makers' Road runs along its edge
    -   Sandy Bend: a larger town two days away
        -   It is mentioned several times but none of the action occurs there

## Previous Events

The story takes place in a world of anthropomorphic animals and patchwork robots.
Its protagonist, Maddy,
is a 13-year-old kangaroo whose younger sister Sindy is a "throwback" with no fur, scales, or tail.
(The description of Sindy make it clear to readers that she looks human,
but the characters in the book don't know what that means:
for them, humans are a half-forgotten legend.)
Maddy and Sindy's father was kidnapped by a raiding band of bots two years before the story starts.
They and their mother have struggled to make ends meet since then.

The story begins with Maddy and a goat boy named Gumption having a run-in with the town bullies.
As Maddy and Gumption walk home afterward they see some broken bits of tech floating downriver.
While fishing it out,
they encounter a damaged bot named Dockety.
The bot's regulator is broken,
which allows it to reveal that rogue bots are about to raid Rusty Bridge again.

Maddy and Gumption rush back to town to warn everyone.
The raiders are driven off,
but manage to grab Sindy and the two bullies.
Maddy teams up with the rescued bot to get her sister back.
They catch up with the raiders and free the prisoners,
but Maddy, Sindy, and Dockety are left stranded in a dangerous swamp called the Mire.
They take refuge in an abandoned bunker,
only to discover that it is the lair of a mad bot named Patient in Darkness,
who is masterminding the raiding parties as part of its campaign
to prove its worth to the Makers.

Maddy, Sindy, and Dockety escape by bolting a flying suit onto Dockety.
They get back to town just moments ahead of another band of raiders.
After the townspeople drive off the raiders,
Maddy realizes that she knows how to break Patient's hold on them.
She uses the flying suit to return to the bunker and frees Patient's minions,
but Patient escapes.
As the story ends,
Dockety reveals that Maddy's father may be alive as a prisoner in the bot city of Heck.
