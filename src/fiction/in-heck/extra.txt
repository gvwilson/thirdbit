## Reunion (Maddy)

"Sindy, Papa, please, wake up! Wake up!" she said
as the bot took a helmet from a nearby shelf
and fitted it carefully over Sindy's curly top-fur.

The whole room vibrated slightly as something heavy woke up and moved on the roof.
"Central communications array online,"
one of the machines pronounced neutrally.
"Control sequence initiated.
Control sequence paused.
Operator input required."

Sindy drew a long, shuddering breath.
"Wake up!" Maddy begged again,
but it was no use.
Sindy opened her eyes and stared dully at the room.

"Central array shutdown requested," she said in perfect step with the bot.
"Request denied.
Emergency shutdown requested.
Request denied."

"Well that don't sound p'ticularly hopeful,"
Thoughtful muttered.

"It's always like this,"
Special Blazes shot back.
"It's got a hundred other tricks to try.
Only question is whether she'll last long enough for it to get through them all."

"Service pause for repair requested.
Request denied.
Service suspension for upgrade requested.
Request denied."
The bot's voice matched Sindy's syllable for syllable,
except no,
it was Sindy's matching the bot's and Mouse's buzzing and beeping.

Special Blazes sighed.
"Might as well take a seat," he said,
and at that moment the door slid open once again.

"Freeze!" Gumption said loudly as he stepped through
and levelled something metallic and dangerous looking at the Operators.

## Your Move (Gumption)

Gumption pulled his arm free of Patient's grip
as Special Blazes unlocked the door of the cage cart
and gathered an unconscious Sindy in his arms.
"Come on!" he hissed.
"It's two of us and two of them!"

"Idiot!" Patient hissed back.
"They are Operators.
If we attack,
they will terminate our functions and recycle our parts."

Thoughtful shouldered her rifle and pulled a lever next to the building's door.
"We can't just stand here,"
Gumption said,
watching the Operators carry Sindy inside.

One of Patient's legs twitched.
"Agreed.
*We* cannot.
This one will do that while you occupy them."

"What?"

"Are your auditory processors defective?
This one will stand here and carry out its original plan.
You will enter the laboratory and distract them.
If you do not survive,
be assured that your sacrifice furthered a great cause."

Gumption gaped at it.
"I have no idea what you're talking about."

Patient skittered backward like a frightened cockroach.
"What did you say?
*What did you say?*"
Hatches opened on its sides.
Its arms folded into them,
immediately re-emerging with a circular sawblade and a scorched nozzle on their ends.

Gumption raised his hands.
"Whoa!" he yelped.
What had he said?
*I have no—oh.*
"Um,
*this one* apologizes for startling you,
but this one does not understand your plan."

The sawblade and flamethrower didn't waver.
"You used proscribed language.
That should not be possible,
even for the unregulated."

Gumption lowered his hands slowly.
"It took a great deal of practice," he improvised.
"We can discuss it later.
Right now,
this one needs you to explain your plan."

Nothing stirred for a moment, not even the breeze.
"Agreed,"
Patient finally snapped,
retracting its arms and replacing their ends with manipulators once again.
"Here, take this."
It held out the scorched nozzle that had been on its arm a moment ago.

Gumption plucked it from the bot's grasp.
"What does it do?"

"Nothing,"
Patient said shortly.
"But they will not know that.
Our triumph is inevitable,
but keep them occupied as long as you can."
And with no further ceremony,
it froze just as Dockety had two blocks away.

"Great," Gumption muttered,
hefting the nozzle.
He patted his armor to make sure the zap gun was still tucked inside it,
then strode across the open square to the door the Operators had gone through
and pulled the lever next to it.

The door slid open.
"Freeze!" Gumption said loudly as he stepped through
and levelled the nozzle at the Operators.
"No, no, none of that," he continued
as Thoughtful's hand twitched toward the rifle slung over her shoulder.
"This one does not want to have to clean your organic bits off the equipment."
He pointed the nozzle at Special Blazes,
then at a bot that looked like Dockety might have when it was brand new,
then back at Thoughtful.

Papa Roo, Maddy, and Sindy sat side by side in padded chairs.
Maddy's eyes were open,
but Papa Roo's and Sindy's were closed.

"Procedure interrupted.
Procedure paused."
Sindy and the bot said in unison.
The bot shivered as if struck with a chill.
Its head pivoted slowly to face Gumption.

"Anomaly," it said in a deep, musical voice.
"Why can we not hear your thoughts?"

"Oh, there's a lot you don't know you can't do," Gumption said.
He hefted the nozzle.
"And a lot this one *can* do that you can't even imagine.
Now,
release the, uh, the organics, or else."

"Or else what?" Special Blazes asked
in the same tone he might have used to ask if he could have an extra mint leaf for his tea.

"Or else this one will splatter your bits all over this room!"

"Mm hm."
Special Blazes scratched his cheek with one clawed finger.
"Seems unlikely.
I mean, sure, maybe you have some fancy-dance tech there that even this guy doesn't recognize."
He jerked his thumb at the bot.
"But I think I'm willing to take that chance."

He really ought to be terrified,
Gumption realized,
but the most he seemed able to feel without a heartbeat was mildly worried.
That's when he also realized that Sindy's eyes were open.
"Perhaps you should ask your captured organics about taking chances,"
he said,
raising his voice slightly.
"They might know more about tech than you think."

The tiger's smile showed sharp white teeth.
"Oh, I think I know plenty about the subject."

"But so does this one,"
Gumption fired back,
pointing at Sindy.
"After all, she can control all of it, not just a few paltry pieces."
He didn't actually know if "paltry" was the right word there,
but he plowed out,
hoping Sindy would understand the hints he was dropping.
"She's a real special, not just a one-off like you playing with things you don't understand."

Special Blazes' jaw tightened.
"All right, that's enough.
Do it."

A single sharp *crack!* rang out.
Gumption's fingers stung as the nozzle was shot out of his hand.

"Should I finish it?"
Thoughtful asked,
keeping the flat little pistol that had somehow appeared in her hand pointed at Gumption's head.

Special Blazes's whiskers twitched.
"Any objections?" he asked the bot across from him.

"None,"
it said.
"What you do to other organics is not our concern."

Thoughtful's ears went up.
"Organics?
What organics?"

"Whatever it is, we can't have it carrying tales," Special Blazes said.
"Or you either, Miz Roo," he added to Maddy.
"I'm sorry, truly I am, but—hey!"

A bright glow appeared under his shirt.
"Gotcha," Sindy croaked in a dry voice.

For the first time Gumption saw fear on the tiger's face,
but as Thoughtful swing her rifle toward Sindy the bot spoke in Patient's mad voice.
"At last!
At last!"

*Crack!*
Thoughtful's rifle went off as the bot knocked it away.
*Ping! Ping!*
The bullet struck a shelf on the other side of the lab and ricocheted away.
Thoughtful pumped the action on the rifle to reload,
yelping as the bot seized the barrel
and then yelping again as Mouse rammed her ankle.

Special Blazes kicked the cleaning bot aside.
"Stop!" he yelled,
though whether he meant Sindy or the bot wrestling with Thoughtful
or everything together,
Gumption couldn't tell.
He threw himself forward,
tripping over Mouse and half-falling on Maddy.

"Get off me!" she squawked.

"Workin' on it," he grunted,
then flinched as a fireball burped out of the tech on Special Blazes' chest.
Heat washed over him,
but the shot had gone off too soon to do more than sizzle in the air.

He couldn't get leverage to pick Maddy up,
so he grabbed her upper arms and rolled to the side,
dragging her out of the chair into a heap on the floor beside him.
"Maddy! Maddy, it's me!"

She pushed him away.
"I can see that, but get off me!"
Her eyes went wide as she realized that she had control of her arms again.

They scrambled to their feet just as another fireball fizzled out of
the scorched hole in Special Blazes' shirt.
The bot still had Thoughtful's rifle in one manipulator.
The other was clamped around the tiger's arm.
The trio spun around as they wrestled,
banging into machinery and knocking boxes off shelves
as Mouse zipped back and forth between their feet
trying to trip the Operators or just because there was nothing else it could do.

"Help me get Sindy!" Maddy ordered.

"No!"
Sindy sounded like she had a mouthful of dry gravel in her mouth,
but there was no mistaking the iron in her voice.
"You gotta leave me here so I can stop 'em from calling more bots!"

"I'm not leaving you!"
Maddy's voice broke.
"I'm not leaving either of you!"

"Just get Papa!"

The bot sidestepped suddenly and swung its arm to send Thoughtful flying.
Spinning,
it grabbed a handful of Special Blazes' fur with its newly-freed manipulator.
"This one has you now!"
Patient cackled.

"No you don't!"
Gumption jumped at the sound of Sindy's voice coming from the bot.

"What?
What are you doing here?
Get out!"
Patient's voice again, shrill and angry.

"You first!
Now get Papa!"

Papa Roo was lighter than Gumption expected.
"What happened to his arms?" he asked
as Sindy and Patient took turns yelling at each other
while Special Blazes shouted at them.

"Tell you later," Maddy grunted,
wrestling her father into a sitting position.
"But what in the name of decency are you wearing?"

"Tell you later," Gumption replied.
"One… two… three!"
They half-lifted, half-rolled Papa Roo out of his chair and onto his feet.
His eyes fluttered for a moment
before his legs gave way and he collapsed onto the tiled floor.

"No!" Sindy wailed in her own voice.

"Yes!" the bot exulted in Patient's.
It spun around,
throwing Special Blazes on top of Thoughtful.
"Nothing can stop this one now!"

The door slid open behind it.
"This one can," Dockety said.

## Finally (Maddy)

Now that they were standing next to each other,
Maddy could see that Dockety and the laboratory bot had once been identical:
the same torso,
the same legs,
and the same oddly-shaped head with crystal lenses for eyes.
Judging from the scars on Dockety and its mismatched arms,
that must have been a long time ago.

But the two bots weren't standing.
They were grappling each other,
their arms moving as fast as hummingbird wings
as each tried to grab something they could twist or tear off.
Metal rang on metal like the bell of Special Leaf's alarm clock.

"Get your papa out of here!"
Gumption ordered.
"I'll get Sindy!"

"I'm not leaving without her!"
Maddy snapped back.

Gumption grabbed her arm.
"Please, just this once, do what I tell you."

Maddy stared at him for a second,
then bent over
and grabbed her father's arms
to drag him away from the padded seats.

"Enough!"
Special Blazes roared,
surging back to his feet.
The two bots spun around,
each trying to shield itself with the other
as the tech on the tiger's chest brightened.
A fireball punched through the air between their heads.

Special Blazes stepped over Thoughtful's unconscious body and raised his hands.
"Sindy!"
Maddy shouted as the Operator pointed them at her sister.

Just as the Operator threw fire,
Dockety threw itself between him and Sindy.
The hot white flame splashed over his head and torso.
He fell.

"Dockety!"
Sindy screamed.
"Dockety, get up!"
But the bot didn't move.

The tech on Special Blazes' chest brightened.
"This ends *now*!" the tiger growled.

But as he spoke,
the machine beside him came to life.
An arm made to move test tubes from one rack to another raked across his face.
A sample drawer shot out,
catching him in the gut.
Dozens—no, hundreds—of other pieces of machinery rattled as the whole lab came to life.

"You hurt my friend!" Sindy said through every speaker in the room.

"Desist!"
Central ordered through the same speakers.
"You must not engage the central communications array!"

High-pitched feedback whined through the speakers.
"Maddy?"
All of a sudden Sindy sounded afraid.
"Maddy, I can't—there's too much.
I can't control it all."

And then Patient's voice comes through again.
"At last! At last! Oh thank you thank you thank you!"
The room vibrated again as heavy equipment pivoted on the roof.

"Desist!
You must not—error.
Protocols are—error."
Central's musical voice broke into two, three, a dozen overlapping voices,
each rising higher and higher in pitch.
"Integrity c-c-compromised.
C-c-consensus breakd-d-d-ooowwnnn."
And then for one moment the voiced united to say,
"Finally,"
and fell silent forever.

"Success!
Success!
Success!"
Patient crowed.
The lab bot's legs did a skittering dance.
"The signal has been sent!
The Makers have been wakened!
They will return!
They will reward this one for its—
They will—"

Its voice buzzed and whined with a sudden surge of feedback.
"What?
No!
Get out!
Get out!
This one has triumphed!
It's not fair!"

"You.
Hurt.
My.
*Friend!*"
Sindy said aloud.
The speakers screamed with feedback.
A thin wisp of smoke rose from the lab bot's head,
and then Patient too fell silent.

"What have you done?" Special Leaf bellowed.
He started to raise his hands—

—and fell to the ground as Gumption shot him with the zap gun.
"Shoulda done that a while back,"
he said with a shrug.

Maddy crossed the floor to her sister in a single bound.
"Sindy!
Sindy, wake up!"
Her sister mumbled something unintelligible and battered her sister's hands away weakly.

Maddy let her breath out with a whoosh and knelt beside Dockety.
The Operator's fireball had burned an ugly scorch mark on its torso.
"Oh Dockety," she said softly,
then yelped as something bumped her knee.

Mouse backed up and bumped her again,
beeping frantically.
"I'm sorry," she said.
"I don't know how to fix it."

The little cleaning bot zipped around to Dockety's head
and extended its single arm.
A spark jumped through the air.

Maddy held her breath.
A moment later the bot's single lens rotated.
"Rebooting," its voice buzzed.

Gumption's hand came down on Maddy's shoulder.
"We should leave.
I will go look for a way to transport your father and sister."

Maddy surged to her feet as he turned to go.
"Is that all you've got to say?" she demanded,
grabbing his arm and spinning him around.

Gumption looked at her expressionlessly.
"We do not know how long the bots will remain incapacitated.
It would be prudent to—"

"Shut up!"
She pulled him close and kissed him.

Somewhere under his fur his heart started to beat again.
Mouse buzzed from the floor.
"Hello, friend," Dockety buzzed weakly.

## Epilog (Gumption)

*Three days later…*

Moonlight dappled the Roos' porch.
Gumption shifted in his chair,
resisting the urge to scratch the spot where his armor had rubbed against his waist.
For want of anything else to wear,
he had left it on as Dockety hauled them back to Rusty Bridge.
"Won't bother me," Maddy had said archly.
Gumption smiled at her but still didn't take it off.

He had been doing a lot of smiling since the fight in the lab.
So had Maddy,
so much that her mother had commented on it
once she got over the happy tears of being reunited with her husband.
"Got a lot to smile about," Maddy had said.

"Ew."
Sindy had made a face,
then hugged her big sister yet again.

"Hey."
Maddy elbowed him gently in the ribs.
"Where'd you go?"

"Sorry,"
Gumption said,
picking up his iced tea and slurping it.
Inside,
he heard Mama Roo ask a question and Papa Roo haltingly reply.
His mind was still fuzzy,
but getting sharper every day.
"Just thinkin' about—about all of it."

Maddy ruffled his fur.
"All of it's a lot."
She put her hand back on the bench between them.

He took it,
marvelling as he still did at how natural that felt.
"Sindy says Special Leaf'll back on his feet soon."

Maddy shrugged.
"Hope so.
She says he told Mayor Lupus that if he didn't make it,
you and me were to get all his books."

Gumption chuckled,
but whatever he might have said was interrupted
by the sound of heavy footsteps on the road.
The two fell silent as Bee Six Vee strode by with Mouse trailing behind it.

"Still don't trust that one,"
Maddy said quietly.

Gumption shrugged.
"Dockety does.
Or leastways,
figures everyone deserves a second chance."

"Even the operators? Or Patient?"
Maddy shot back.

Gumption squeezed her hand as Mama Roo stepped onto the porch
with a fresh pitcher of tea and her husband behind her,
thankful he didn't have to reply.
"Beautiful evening,"
Mama Roo said,
lifting Papa Roo's arm and putting it around her shoulders.

Papa Roo and Gumption looked at each other and started to laugh.
"What?" the two Roo women said together.

"Nothin'," Gumption said innocently,
then pointed at the sky.
"But hey, look—a shootin' star!
Everybody make a wish."

The dot above them brightened and lengthened,
turning into a glowing white streak.
Gumption's heart almost stopped for a second time when Papa Roo spoke.
"They are awake,"
he said dreamily.
"They are returning.
The Makers are coming."

*To be continued…*
