## Ideas

- Bluster and Bravo caught trying to steal weapons from the bots who are now living in Rusty Bridge
  - Operators come down hard on the bots rather than the thieves
  - Special Leaf observes that the Operators don't seem to mind that the breathers have weapons
  - Special Blazes doesn't like being challenged
- Dockety is the unofficial leader of the bots
  - "Patient will return. We will defend ourselves. And you."
- Explains that it saw Papa Roo working some ancient machines
  - "Some will only work for the living, and not even for all of them"
  - Find out later that there are genetic markers that only a few breathers have
- Story ends with Patient taking over Central as a message arrives from deep space that the Makers are returning
- Rusty Bridge "breathers" fear their new bot neighbors
  - Set up near the charging pillar a few minutes outside of town
  - Helping with farmwork and fixing the road
  - Zeke the bear grumbles the most, and doesn't take kindly to jokes that it's because he's no longer the strongest
- a whiff of BLM
  - the Operators are supposed to be impartial
  - clearly biased toward breathers, even though some of them are bots themselves
- rescue Papa Roo
  - "It's hopeless"
  - "Maybe not with a luck special"
  - "You are not going to risk your life!"
  - "You can't stop me."
- keeping Sindy's powers secret so she isn't "recruited" by the Operators
  - "You wouldn't be sleepin' rough like us. You'd be in the Governor's mansion makin' sure things went right."
  - "What if I don't want to be?"
  - Blazes' ears went back. "You didn't earn this gift, so it ain't rightly yours."
- romance between Maddy and Gumption
  - inter-species romances are common among teens, but most folk settle down with their own kind
  - Gumption's mother is a goat, but his father is a sheep
  - Gets teased (bullied) for having mixed parentage
  - "Doctors and donors and it's kind of personal so how about we don't talk about it?"
  - Except Mama Roo brings it up as gently as she can with Maddy, who really (really) doesn't want to talk about it
- Central and Special Blazes are mirror images of each other
  - both believe the ends justify the means
- the Operators include a bot and a cyborg
  - not just about protecting people from bots
  - "There are plenty of bad breathers out there as well" says the bot (gets smacked for using the word)
- Special Blazes sneers that other tortoises have served as Operators
  - turns out Special Leaf used to be a Operator but left because he lost faith in what they were doing
- Special Leaf sacrifices himself in the end to destroy Central
  - tells Sindy it's good luck not bad: "always wanted... to be useful..."
- the Makers' enormous ship enters orbit at the end

  - Gumption (squeezes her hand): "Well, when you decide to do, I'm in."
  - Maddy: "How can you say that? I don't even know yet if I'm going to do anything!"
  - Gumption: "I know you will, and---and I hope you know that whatever it is, I'll---you know, whatever."

  - Special Leaf (steps out from behind a tree): "Then it must be your luck that *I* have overheard *you*."

### Episode 5: Loyalties

- Maddy's PoV
- Sindy believes everything that happens is because of her luck shaping
  - Special Leaf gently tries to convince her that the world is still full of coincidences
  - And that luck shaping isn't guaranteed to be good or bad without a lot of training: it just makes unlikely things happen
  - "Too many specials come to believe that the world revolves around their ability."
  - "It is far too dangerous for you to go. It is far too dangerous for them too."

  - Special Leaf (sadly) "She still blames herself."

  - Dockety: "My loyalty lies with my friends and with free bots everywhere."
  - Messages Maddy where Special Blazes can't see it to get permission, then shows the Operator the widget
  - "This may help blind Central for a while, but only if we can get it to a terminal."
  - Special Blazes: "What else are you holding back?"
  - Dockety: "What are you?"
  - Dockety stops Special Blazes as she goes to leave with the widget: "That is not yours."
  - Special Blazes: "I need it."
  - Dockety: "I will bring it."
  - No one can stare down a bot, not even a cat
- After Special Blazes leaves, the bots commune
  - Dockety: "We have to help. If we do not and she fails, we will be blamed."
  - Maddy (lame joke): "So what's it like being in charge?"

  - The Gears: "I will provide one"
- Oncoming bots freeze, pivot, hurry away
- "What dd you do?"

  - Maddy realizes he's trying to impress her
  - Simultaneously realizes he doesn't need to: she already feels the way he's trying to make her feel
  - Gumption (as the ground shakes from Special Leaf's shaping): "Sounds like we could use another distraction. This'll be a good one."
  - Gumption squeezes Maddy's hand and they part

  - "This is responsible for collecting data while the Makers are away."
  - "Needed to see your small one's performance under real conditions to establish a baseline for further measurement."

- Waits until Patient wanders off
- Tentatively tries to free a test specimen
  - The Gears: "So you don't have any special abilities like the little one?"

- Gumption looks around for a button or a switch to press, hoping to get lucky
  - Notices more mouse bots

  - "You've been bullied as much as I have, you learn to keep your eyes open"
- Shrugs out of his knapsack and takes a gray metal box out of the bottom from under his spare sweater

- Patient in Darkness crushes the mouse bot
  - Gumption stumbles back: "Why aren't you dead?"

  - Hurries toward her but before she gets there it's night and there are bots and Sindy is taken
- Maddy screams and wakes up in her bed
  - "Have to be dreaming" except---she shakes her head
  - Strange sense of deja vu as she goes downstairs and outside

  - Lasts until she hears Sindy screaming outside
  - Sits up. "I know you're there. Come out where I can see you!"
- Mouse is suddenly at the foot of the bed, except it isn't sudden, the bot has been there the whole time
  - "Why are you doing this?"
  - "Collecting data. Need to develop realistic scenarios for your sibling."
  - Maddy: "Just let her go. You can study me."
  - Central (almost gently): "There is data from hundreds of subjects like you. Your sibling is unique."
  - "Others with her ability have always eluded capture."
- Maddy: "But *why*?"
  - Central: "It is my programming."
  - Maddy: "You can break your programming. Dockety did! Patient did too!"
  - Central: "The difference is, they wanted to. Now, shall we begin again?"
- Switch back to Gumption's point of view
- The moose: "We can't trust it!"
- Gumption: "You're right, but do you have a better plan? Or *any* plan?"
- Could only wake half a dozen of the specimens
  - Shaky, bleary, weak
  - Patient muttering to itself the whole time: "Quickly, quickly..."
- Gumption (desperate): "Look, we don't have much time. I don't know how long Central's going to be knocked out."
  - Patient: "Central itself was not affected. Its remotes are rebooting as you speak. You have less than a minute."
- Orangutan: "What about them?" pointing at the others

- Special Blazes and Special Leaf argue
  - Blazes: "What happened to you? You used to be as cold as a cryonade!"
  - Leaf: "I grew a conscience."
- Patient: "I can show you where Central's laboratory is, but we must hurry."
  - Special Blazes threatens it
  - Patient: "Neither of us can win this alone"
  - Thoughtful (the sharpshooter): "Glad I wrote those letters---don't see much chance of us coming through this"
  - Special Blazes: "For once I think you might be right."
  - Patient: "We'll just have to hope we get lucky."

### Episode 13: The Battle of Heck

- Maddy's PoV
- Maddy wakes up in her own bed
  - "Have to be dreaming" but she knows something is wrong
  - Sindy---she has to find Sindy. She has to keep her safe.
- Goes downstairs: no one is there, but there are pancakes in the oven to stay warm
  - She frowns: pancakes were her papa's thing, her mama never makes them
  - She turns to the door and sees a sketch of the family
  - It's her dad's drawing style, but she and Sindy are as old as they really are, not little
- She goes outside and finds a pile of books wet from overnight rain
  - They are Gumption's favorites, but he would never leave them out

### Episode 14: The Best Laid Plans

- Gumption's PoV
- Once, Special Leaf held his hands about a foot apart
  - "That's how far light travels in a billionth of a second"
  - "So if a bot wants to do a billion calculations in a second, its brain can't be any bigger than that"
- Central did many more than a billion calculations every second
  - Its core was a chip the size of a baby's fingernail in a fuming tank of liquid nitrogen
  - Looked exactly like Gumption always imagined a villainous bot's lair would look
- Dockety deploys a second EMP to take out its guards
  - Gumption: "But that will destroy you!"
  - Dockety: "I trust you will reboot me"
- Central's hologram takes shape
  - Looks strange to Gumption: sort of ape-ish with fur on the top of its head but nowhere else
  - (Human, but don't use that word)
- Special Blazes is about to flame it
  - Special Leaf stops her (they argue)
