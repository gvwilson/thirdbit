# Notes on "In Heck"

- *In Heck* is the second book in a trilogy that starts with *Maddy Roo* (synopsis below)
- Like all middles it is proving difficult to write
- Grateful for community feedback on this outline before I start (re-)writing
- Also an experiment on the value of getting critiques of a point-form outline

## Synopsis of *Maddy Roo*

The story takes place in a world of anthropomorphic animals and patchwork robots.
Its protagonist, Maddy,
is a 12-year-old kangaroo whose younger sister Sindy is a "throwback" with no fur, scales, or tail.
(Description of Sindy make it clear to readers that she looks human, but the characters don't realize that.)
Their father was kidnapped by a raiding band of bots two years before the story opens;
they and their mother have struggled to make ends meet since then.

The story opens with Maddy and a goat boy named Gumpion rescuing a damaged bot from a stream.
Its regulator breaks,
which allows it to reveal that another raid is about to take place.
Maddy and Gumption rush back to town to warn everyone;
the raiders are driven off,
but not before grabbing Sindy and two other children.

Maddy teams up with the rescued robot, Dockety, to get her sister back.
The pair catch up with the raiders and free the prisoners,
but in the confusion that follows Maddy, Sindy, and Dockety are stranded in a dangerous swamp.
They take refuge in an abandoned bunker,
only to discover that it is the lair of a mad robot named Patient in Darkness,
who is responsible for the raiding parties.

The trio escapes by bolting a flying suit onto Dockety.
They get back to town just moments ahead of a fresh wave of raiders.
In the aftermath of the ensuing battle
Maddy realizes that she knows how to free the bots that Patient is controlling.
She uses the flying suit to return to the bunker
and manages to break Patient's control.
As the story ends,
Dockety reveals that Maddy's father may still be alive as a prisoner in the bot city of Heck.

## Background

- Long ago, as the world was falling apart, humans created intelligent animals
  - Are now remembered as "the Makers" and semi-revered even though their appearance has been forgotten
- Different "species" can interbreed, but normally pair with the same species
  - Almost all children always take after one or the other parent
  - But a handful are human-form "throwbacks" (slightly derogatory term) or "originals" (more polite)
- Some people called "specials" have the ability to control a few pieces of leftover tech
  - Throwback specials can often control *all* tech, which  makes them powerful and dangerous
- The last humans put themselves in frozen sleep in an orbiting ark to wait for the world to heal itself
  - The bots they left behind have been repairing themselves ever since
  - Not able to create new bots (no way to manufacture new "brains")
  - Bots and people mingle uneasily
    - When they do, bots usually have second-class social status
  - Most bots are part of a hive-mind consensus
    - Those with personalities have cut themselves off somehow
    - And fear being pulled back in and losing their individuality
- The Operators are peacekeepers and vigilantes
  - Fend off outlaws and raiding bots
  - But also keep specials in line
  - Particularly throwback specials, who might be able to awaken the sleeping Makers
- Notable places
  - Rusty Bridge: a village of about a thousand people
    - After the events of *Maddy Roo*, a small bot encampment has sprung up nearby
  - Sandy Bend: a larger town two days away
    - Mentioned several times but none of the action occurs there
  - Heck: a bot "city"
    - Story reveals that it was the base from which the Makers' ark was launched
    - Bots are still running experiments there in automated laboratories because their programming tells them to
  - The Mire is a large, polluted swamp between Rusty Bridge and Heck
    - An old highway referred to as the Makers' Road runs along its edge
