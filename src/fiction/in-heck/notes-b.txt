# Notes on "In Heck"

- *In Heck* is the second book in a trilogy that starts with *Maddy Roo* (synopsis below).
- Like all middles it is proving difficult to write.
- I would appreciate community feedback on this outline before I start re-writing.
- This is also an experiment on the value of getting critiques of a point-form outline.

## Synopsis of *Maddy Roo* (the preceding book in the series)

The story takes place in a world of anthropomorphic animals and patchwork robots.
Its protagonist, Maddy,
is a 12-year-old kangaroo whose younger sister Sindy is a "throwback" with no fur, scales, or tail.
(The description of Sindy make it clear to readers that she looks human,
but the characters in the book don't know what that means:
for them, humans are a half-forgotten legend.)
Maddy and Sindy's father was kidnapped by a raiding band of bots two years before the story starts.
They and their mother have struggled to make ends meet since then.

The story begins with Maddy and a goat boy named Gumption having a run-in
with the town bullies.
As Maddy and Gumption walk home afterward they see some broken bits of tech floating downriver.
While fishing it out,
they rescue encounter a damaged bot named Dockety.
The bot's regulator is broken,
which allows it to reveal that another raid is about to take place.

Maddy and Gumption rush back to town to warn everyone.
The raiders are driven off,
but not before grabbing Sindy and two other children.
Maddy teams up with the rescued bot to get her sister back.
The pair catch up with the raiders and free the prisoners,
but in the confusion that follows Maddy, Sindy, and Dockety are stranded in a dangerous swamp.
They take refuge in an abandoned bunker,
only to discover that it is the lair of a mad bot named Patient in Darkness,
who is masterminding the raiding parties as part of its campaign
to prove its worth to "the Makers".

Maddy, Sindy, and Dockety escape by bolting a flying suit onto Dockety.
They get back to town just moments ahead of another band of raiders.
In the aftermath of the ensuing battle
Maddy realizes that she knows how to break Patient's control of the bots.
She uses the flying suit to return to the bunker and frees the bots,
but Patient escapes.
As the story ends,
Dockety reveals that Maddy's father may still be alive as a prisoner in the bot city of Heck.

## Background

- Long ago, as the world was falling apart, humans created intelligent animals.
  - Human are now remembered and revered as "the Makers", but their nature and appearance has been forgotten.
- Different species of intelligent animals can interbreed, though they tend to pair with the same species.
  - Almost all children take after one or the other parent.
  - But a handful are "throwbacks" (a slightly derogatory term) or "originals" (more polite).
  - Descriptions in the story make it clear to readers that these are people with "normal" human form.
- Some people called "specials" have the ability to control a few pieces of leftover tech.
  - Throwback specials can often control *all* tech devices, which  makes them powerful and dangerous.
- The last humans put themselves in frozen sleep in an orbiting ark to wait for the world to heal itself.
  - Ever since, the bots they left behind have been patching and repairing themselves however they can.
  - They are not able to create new bots because they have no way to manufacture new "brains".
- Most bots are part of a hive-mind Consensus.
  - The only ones with unique personalities are those that have accidentally been cut off or have somehow done it deliberately.
  - These bots fear being pulled back into Consensus and losing their individuality.
- Bots and people mingle uneasily.
  - When they do, bots usually have second-class social status.
- The Operators are peacekeepers (or vigilantes, depending on your point of view).
  - They fend off outlaws and raiding bots.
  - But their secret purpose is to keep watch on throwback specials, who might be able to awaken the sleeping Makers.
  - Neither Consensus nor the few people who know the truth about the Makers want the Makers to return.
- Notable places:
  - Rusty Bridge: a town of about a thousand people.
    - After the events of *Maddy Roo*, a small bot encampment is taking shape nearby.
  - Sandy Bend: a larger town two days away.
    - It is mentioned several times but none of the action occurs there.
  - Heck: a bot "city".
    - The story reveals that it was the base from which the Makers' ark was launched.
    - Consensus bots are still running experiments there in automated laboratories because their programming tells them to.
  - The Mire: a large, polluted swamp between Rusty Bridge and Heck.
    - Old bunkers and watch towers can be found in it and nearby.
    - An old highway referred to as the Makers' Road runs along its edge.

## Protagonists

- Maddy Roo (protagonist): a 13-year-old female kangaroo who wants to become an artist.
  - She has elder sibling syndrome, magnified by her father's absence
    - She bosses her sister Sindy around and takes responsibility very seriously.
  - Maddy has feelings for Gumption but doesn't know what to do about them.
- Gumption Gruff: a 13-year-old goat from a large family.
  - He loves books, which makes him odd for a goat (and occasionally a target for bullying by his cousins Bluster and Bravo).
  - He is Madica's best friend, and while he'd like to be something more, he doesn't want to hold her back.
  - Gumption is traumatized by the events of first book (in which he was injured).
    - He is now trying to toughen up, which is causing tension between him and Maddy.
- Chapters alternate between their points of view.

  - Mouse: a small maintenance bot that escaped from Patient's lair.
    - The story reveals that Dockety and Crusher are adopting and upgrading Mouse (analogous to having a family).
