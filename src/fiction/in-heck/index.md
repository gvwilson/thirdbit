## Mail (Maddy)

Maddy was sketching the willow tree in the main square of Rusty Bridge
when one of the Ox brothers hollered,
"Mail's coming!"
*Finally*, she thought,
giving her drawing one last despairing look.
The branches were in the right places,
but somehow the lines on the page didn't capture
the drooping greenery on the willow in front of her.

She sighed and tucked her sketchbook into
the blue canvas satchel her father had made for her tenth birthday.
A lot had happened since then,
but at least now she knew he might still be alive.

"Waitin' on anythin' in particular?"
a familiar voice drawled behind her.

Maddy jumped.
Mayor Lupus smiled down at her,
a mug of tea in her hand.
It was a kindly smile,
but it still showed a lot of teeth.
"Mama sent off for some seeds," Maddy said.
"And my chores were all done, and—"

"—and it's a beautiful day so why not sit for a bit?"
the old wolf finished, nodding agreeably.
She jerked her chin toward Maddy's bag.
"You're gettin' a lot better.
Your pa would be pleased."

"Thank you," Maddy mumbled.
Mayor Lupus had a way of looking at you
that made you feel like she could read your mind.
That was part of why the village kept electing her:
most people felt guilty just thinking about running against her.

A double handful of people gathered to gossip as they waited for the mail.
Zeke Bear had finally fixed the smokehouse
that had been knocked down during the attack a few months ago.
He might not especially like the bots who had helped save them,
but he would allow that they were useful.
And the Ox brothers' apple orchard was draining properly
for the first time in forever,
and there wasn't a dull pair of scissors in town.

"Still, having that sort about makes me feel uncomfortable,"
Miz Nabbles sighed loudly,
shaking her graying mane.

Mayor Lupus tipped the dregs of her tea into a planter.
"I reckon how we feel is our problem, not theirs,"
she said conversationally.
"And if any trouble shows up, well…"
She rapped her gnarlywood cane against her mechanical leg.
"Fightin' bots is a lot easier when you have a few on your side."

Miz Nabbles's mane twitched at the rebuke
as if to shoo away a fly.
She had put herself forward for election the year before,
but had garnered even fewer votes than the mayor's previous challenger.
"Folks might think it's time for a change,"
Mama Roo had explained to Maddy afterward,
"But if she's what change looks like, they'd rather wait."

"Aaaand right on time,"
Mayor Lupus said as the mailbot came into view.
Eighty-Eight Able-Six ("but call me Able") looked like three metal boxes
perched on top of one another
with a single small wheel up front
and two spoked cartwheels in the rear.
It only had one arm,
and like many free bots
it had patches and welds from years of mending,
but someone had made it a blue hat with a little tin badge,
which it wore proudly wherever it went.

Able rolled to a halt and doffed its hat.
"Good morning, one and all."

"You've made good time,"
the mayor said as Able opened a hatch in its side.

"Got a lift in from Sandy Bend,"
the bot replied,
opening a hatch in its side.
"Big fella haulin' some passengers.
They oughta be along shortly.
Now, let's see—I got letters,
I got parcels,
even got a newspaper from Sandy Bend."
Its periscope cameras swivelled from side to side
as it handed out what it had brought.

Someone bumped Maddy's elbow.
"Hey,"
Gumption said.

"Hey," she said back.
He had slicked down his fur the way some of the older goats did.
It made them look tough,
but—she stifled a sigh.
He just looked like he'd been caught in a rainstorm.

She would have told him that six months ago,
but he'd changed since the bot attack.
It had taken him a long time for his ribs to heal.
Once he was back on his feet he had started using the punching bag
in Zeke Bear's barn
and doing militia drills with an old pike.
And while they still saw each other almost every day,
her half-admitted hope that
they would do more than play checkers and read the same books
were still just hopes.

Gumption jerked his chin at the mailbot.
"Anything for you?"

She was about to say, "No," when Able called her name.
She traded a glass penny for a letter in a plain brown envelope
with "Miz Madalena Roo, Rusty Bridge" written on its front
in strong, square letters.

Maddy took a slow breath.
"Well? Aren't you gonna open it?"
Gumption asked.

She shook her head.
"Not here.
You want to go look in on Special Leaf?"

Gumption shrugged.
"Sure.
Has he got Sindy doin' magic tricks again?"

"Ssh!"
Maddy glanced around involuntarily.
Special Leaf insisted that they keep her sister's abilities secret.

Gumption shrugged again.
"Sorry," he muttered,
and then,
"Hey—look!"

"What in tarnation?" Mayor Lupus exclaimed.
A murmur ran through the crowd
as two bots entered the square
with a pair of muddy, sullen goats between them.
Dockety was in the lead,
its mis-matched arms swinging as it strode toward the crowd.
Its companion Crusher brought up the rear on heavy treads,
and in between—

"Are those boys *tied up*?"
Miz Nabbles gasped,
her ears folding down in shock.

"Quiet down," Mayor Lupus said sharply.
The crowd parted to let her through,
her cane clicking on the cobblestones.

"Morning," she said to Dockety.
"I thought Able had brought all the mail,
but it seems you have somethin' for us too."

The lenses on the front of Dockety's head rotated a quarter turn and back
with a faint *zick zick*.
"These ones were apprehended
while attempting to take items that do not belong to them,"
it said,
its voice buzzing slightly.
"We request punitive measures to deter further attempts."

Mayor Lupus sucked in her cheeks.
"Is that right, boys?
Were you stealin'?"

"No we wasn't!"
Bluster Goat protested vehemently.
"We were just tryin' to find out if they been hidin' stuff,
and we did!
They got weapons stashed away!
All kinds of them!"

"I said quiet down!"
Mayor Lupus snapped as people began muttering.
"That's a pretty serious accusation, Mister Goat.
You best be sure of your ground."

"Bravo seen 'em too," Bluster said.
His twin brother nodded vigorously.
"Big pile o' stuff laid out in one o' those sheds they been buildin'."

"Those are not weapons,"
Dockety buzzed.
"They are spare parts.
Many of us still require repairs."

"Spare parts my tail!" Bluster said hotly.
"They got a zap gun an' saw blades and all sorts."

"Dockety?
Any o' that true?"
the mayor asked.
Her tone was still light,
but her ears had flattened too.

"These possess several saw blades," the bot acknowledged.
It gestured at Crusher.
"This one has been using them to clear brush."

"And the zap gun?"

"It is not operational."
The bot's lenses rotated back and forth again.
"But if we are able to repair it,
we will use it only for defensive purposes."

"Says *you*,"
Miz Nabbles muttered,
just loudly enough to be heard.

Mayor Lupus scowled at her,
then turned her look on Dockety.
"Would have been neighborly to let us know you had that."

"Understood," Dockety said.
"These will do so in future."

"And you two,"
the mayor continued,
turning to the goat twins.
"It's not your place to be pokin' around like that.
No,
don't interrupt me,
that's just going to make me cranky.
You're both on ditch weeding duty for the next month,
and if you do somethin' lump stupid like this again
you'll be lookin' back on ditches like they were apple pie.
You got that?"

Bluster opened his mouth to protest,
but snapped it shut when his twin kicked his leg.
"Yes'm," they said in sullen unison.

"All right, then."
Mayor Lupus nodded at Dockety to untie them.

"Let's get out of here," Bluster snapped at his brother
once they were free.
They stalked away side by side,
their boots clomping on the cobblestones.

"Those boys make me *so* mad!"
Maddy grouched to Gumption.
"They'd be chained up in Heck or worse
if it weren't for Dockety."

"I guess,"
Gumption said noncommittally.

"You don't think so?"
Maddy demanded hotly.

"I didn't say that!"
Gumption protested.
"But Miz Nabbles was by for tea yesterday,
and she and my ma and pa were all sayin'
we don't really know much about them.
I like havin' 'em here,"
he added hastily,
anticipating Maddy's outrage.
"But she said—Miz Nabbles, I mean—that they call us 'breathers'."

"Well, we call 'em a lot worse than that,"
Maddy snapped.

Gumption threw up his hands.
"I don't!
I like 'em better than I like a lot o' people,
you know that!
I'm just sayin' a lot of folks aren't as quick with change as you."

Whatever Maddy might have said next was cut off
by a pair of voices shouting,
"Fight! Fight!"

## The Operators (Gumption)

"What now?"
Mayor Lupus asked,
exasperated,
as the twins ran back into the square.

Bluster bent over and put his elbows on his knees to catch his breath.
"Some travellers just come off the road!"
Bravo panted.
"An' the bots are fightin' with 'em!
They got guns an' tech an' everythin'!"

Whatever Mayor Lupus might have said next was cut off
by a sizzle and a sharp *crack!*
A fireball shot into the air from the other side of the blacksmith's,
leaving a trail of smoke behind it.

"You!" Mayor Lupus barked,
jabbing a finger at Maddy.
"Fast as you can,
go an' get Special Leaf!
The rest of you, stay here!"
She shouldered past the gaping onlookers
and hurried off behind the twins
as another fireball followed the first into the sky,
her cane and prosthetic leg rapping the cobblestones
in an uneven staccato.
People exchanged looks and followed her.

Gumption watched Maddy run off without a backward glance.
He took one step after her,
swore,
and fell in behind the crowd instead.

He caught up with them in time to hear Mayor Lupus shout, "Enough!"
Dockety and Crusher stood side by side on the street facing three strangers.
The rabbit had a long rifle on her shoulder
and a slouch hat pulled down over her ears.
The six-legged mulebot beside her had a wagon hitched behind it.
Its heavy armor put Special Leaf's shell to shame.

Behind them both stood a tiger with a black patch over one eye,
his hands raised as if to play dodgeball.
She wore a dark green jacket with black collar and cuffs
that matched the rabbit's
and the camouflage on the mulebot.

"Operators," Gumption breathed.

"No kidding."
Bluster elbowed him hard,
but his eyes were just as wide as Gumption's.

"Anyone mind explainin' what's goin' on here?"
Mayor Lupus said,
her tone making it clear that "no thank you" wasn't an acceptable answer.

"My apologies, Miz Mayor,"
the tiger replied,
lisping slightly around his fangs.
"Are these two friends of yours?"

"They're neighbors,"
she allowed,
flicking an ear.
"But you do have me at a disadvantage."

"Special Blazes at your service,"
the tiger replied,
tapping a finger against the brim of his hat.

The crowd let out its collective breath.
"I *knew* it," Bluster said reverently.
Special Blazes was *famous*.
Every story in the newspaper about his exploits said so:
"The famous Special Blazes has triumphed again!"
The Case of the Snorkeling Smugglers,
the Shootout at Half-Heart Pass,
his year-long pursuit of
the villainous Mattock sisters—Gumption had devoured them all
despite Maddy's disdain for "sensationalism".

"Well,
Special,
it's an honor to have you here,"
Mayor Lupus said.
"Oh,
and may I introduce Special Leaf?"

The elderly tortoise had appeared with Maddy at his elbow.
He was wearing a shapeless gray sweater
that Mama Bear had knit for him the winter before last,
and had an old blue scarf wrapped around his neck as well
despite the sun's warmth.
He peered at the Operators through his little round glasses
as if trying to decide whether they were books that needed re-shelving.

The rabbit lowered his rifle and doffed her hat.
Special Blazes nodded.
"It's an honor," he rumbled.

"Thank you, thank you,"
Special Leaf said in a slightly fuddled tone.
"As the mayor says,
Crusher and Dockety are neighbors.
I'm sure they didn't mean to scare you."

The rabbit muttered something that may or may not have been,
"We weren't scared."

The tiger lowered his hands.
"I'm glad to hear it.
My apologies if we overreacted."
*LIKEWISE* scrolled across the screen
set into the front of the mulebot.

Mayor Lupus turned to Dockety.
"Well?" she said as the moment stretched.
"Anything you'd like to stay to the Special?"

The bot's lenses rotated.
"Welcome to Rusty Bridge."
It buzzed static at Crusher,
who lowered its own massive arms reluctantly.

"Well,
I'm glad that's sorted,"
Special Leaf said brightly.
"If you'd like some tea,
you'd be very, um…"
He gestured vaguely in the direction of his house.

Special Blazes dipped his head.
"Thank you,
but what we'd like most right now is a chance to wash up
and chat with the mayor."
The mulebot made a grinding noise.
"Oh,
and our bot wouldn't mind a bit of oil and a chance to recharge,"
he added.

"I'm sure we can manage all of that,"
Mayor Lupus said.
She waved the Operators toward the square and followed them,
chatting with Special Blazes.
The townspeople dithered and buzzed for a few moments,
then decided in ones and twos
that their chores weren't going to do themselves
and headed for home.

"You ever seen Operators before?"
Gumption asked Special Leaf.

The old tortoise nodded.
"Not in some years," he replied quietly,
all traces of fuddlement gone from his voice.

"Why do you think they're here?"

Special Leaf shook his head.
"I don't know.
But please,
be very, very careful what you say,
especially around Blazes.
He is every bit as smart as the stories say,
and the less he knows about Sindy,
the better."

The threesome walked back to Special Leaf's house in silence.
"Done for the day?"
Maddy asked her sister once they were inside,
ruffling the hair on top of Sindy's head.

"Just let me finish this chapter,"
Sindy said without looking up from her book.

"You're welcome to take it with you,"
Special Leaf said gently.
The battle with the bots
had added more wrinkles to Special Leaf's green-gray hide,
but his eyes were still bright behind his little round glasses.

"But this is the most exciting part!
Please?"
Sindy pleaded.

Maddy looked at Gumption, who shrugged.
"I don't mind waiting."
He was supposed to spend the day weeding his family's vegetable garden.
It wasn't the worst job in the world,
but even if he wore his father's waxed cotton slicker
his fur would get soaked and muddy,
and stooping over would make his half-healed ribs ache.
On the other hand,
at least Maddy had asked before making a decision.

"Five minutes,"
Maddy told her sister sternly.

Special Leaf nodded toward the kitchen.
The two teenagers followed him into it.
"How's she doing?" Maddy asked
as Gumption plopped himself down in his usual chair,
then winced at a twinge in his ribs.

"Very well,"
the old tortoise said.
He fished a small metal-rimmed rectangle of black glass out of his pocket.
"I came by this up years ago.
Never knew what it did,
but she picked it up this morning
and all of a sudden there were pictures floating in the air above it.
Except they weren't really pictures,"
he continued,
looking wistfully at the bit of ancient tech.
"They looked as solid as any of us."

"That's great," Gumption said when Maddy didn't respond.
Sindy was one of those rare people with no tail,
no whiskers or scales,
and no fur except for the wiry black tuft on her head.
When other children wanted to be cruel they called her a throwback,
but every piece of tech she touched responded to her.

The look on Maddy's face told Gumption that
she was worrying yet again about
what might happen if people found out about Sindy's gift,
so he elbowed her in the ribs to distract her.
"Aren't you going to tell him?"

Special Leaf wrinkled his forehead,
which was as close as he could get to raising his nonexistent eyebrows.
Maddy reluctantly pulled the letter out of her satchel.
"I was wondering when that would arrive," Special Leaf said.
He opened the breadbox on the counter behind him,
took out a butternut cookie,
and offered it to Maddy.

"What's this for?" she asked.

"If it's good news, for celebrating," Special Leaf said.
"And if it's not,
well,
at least you'll have a cookie."

Gumption elbowed Maddy again.
"Just *open* it."

She swallowed,
tore the envelope open,
and unfolded the beige rectangle of paper inside.
Her face fell.

"Aw, muck," Gumption said,
patting her awkwardly on the shoulder.
"I'm sorry."

She shook her head.
"No.
No.
They—"
She laughed shakily.
"They said yes.
They're going to publish it.
They're going to put my drawing in the newspaper!
Woo!"

She hugged Gumption impulsively,
then turned to Special Leaf with a grin as wide as a sunrise on her face.
"Congratulations," he said
as she took an enormous bite out of the cookie.

Later that night,
Gumption lay in his narrow cot
and listened to the raindrops drip off
the cottonwood outside his attic bedroom.
The sound matched his mood perfectly.
He was happy for Maddy,
he really was.
Having one of her drawing published in a newspaper
mattered almost as much to her
as saving Rusty Bridge from a band of marauding bots.

It was great news,
but it also meant she was that much closer
to leaving for somewhere better
full of people as smart and as talented as she was.
He'd known since their first conversation about books at Special Leaf's
that she would be going some day.
He just wished that day wasn't getting closer quite so fast.

He nearly fell out of bed when something rapped softly on his window.
"'Bout time," he muttered,
getting quietly to his feet.
He had oiled the shutter after dinner to prevent it squeaking,
and the nearest branch of the cottonwood was an easy stretch away.

Dockety waited patiently for him at the base of the tree.
"Thank you again for warning this one about your cousins' plan,"
it said without preamble.

"You're welcome."
Gumption hesitated.
"So what did you find out?"

The bot's lenses rotated back and forth.
"He is still alive."

Gumption swallowed hard,
even though it was what he'd hoped to hear.
"Are you sure?"

"No,
but he is the right age, gender, and body form,
and Central's records of him start at the right time."
A single drip trickled down the bot's head like a tear as it spoke.
"It will be difficult to obtain more information.
We can only communicate when—"
Dockety paused.
"You do not have the words.
There are little moons above this world,
placed in the sky by the Makers.
We can only interrogate Central when they are in the right positions,
and even then,
we only dare do it briefly."

Gumption shook his head.
He didn't understand the part about "little moons",
but that didn't matter.
"Is he aright?"

"He is—"
Dockety paused again as it searched for the right word.
"He is functional, but not optimal.
There are machines in the facility that only work for organic operators.
This is why Central takes your people.
The facility was not designed to sustain them.
They usually do not last very long.
If we are going to attempt a rescue,
we must act soon."

A sudden thought struck Gumption.
"What about the Operators?" he asked excitedly.
"They must know *tons* about places like this!
I can bring 'em out here to meet you and—"

"No!"
Dockety's voice buzzed sharply.
"You must not involve them."

Gumption ran a hand over his head and flicked away the drops.
"Why not?
They're just tryin' to keep folk safe."

"Perhaps,"
Dockety responded.
"But who keeps us safe from them?"

Gumption sighed.
"Aright.
Thank you for findin' out."

As he reached for a branch of the cottonwood Dockety asked,
"What are you going to tell Miz Roo?"

"Dunno yet."
Gumption grunted at the pain in his side
as he pulled himself up into the tree.
He had a lot of thinking to do.
Not for the first time,
he wished he had someone he could do it with.

## School (Maddy)

"Sorry, Miz Nabbles,"
Maddy said the next morning with half-hearted sincerity.
She and Sindy had gotten to school
just as Rusty Bridge's other children were finishing
a ragged rendition of the Plea to the Makers.
Miz Nabbles glared at Sindy even more sternly than usual
as the sisters slipped into their seats.
*Please let it be a normal day,*
Maddy thought.

But it was not to be.
"Class—class!
Settle down, please,"
Miz Nabbles said in her braying voice.
"How many of you know what a Operator is?"
Every hand shot into the air.
"And how many of you know that
we actually have some Operators here in Rusty Bridge *right now*?"
Hands strained to reach even higher
as an excited murmur rippled through the room.

"Well,"
Miz Nabbles said indulgently,
"If you all promise to be *very good*,
we have a special treat today.
Everybody find a partner.
No,
Jessamyn,
you can't be your own partner,
just—yes, Filbert, anyone will do.
All right?
Two by two,
then,
let's go outside for our surprise!"
She sighed as twenty-two children scrambled for the exit,
their partners forgotten.

Gumption was the last one through the door.
"Oh wow," he breathed,
then added,
"Sorry,"
when Maddy shot him a look.
There,
in the center of the more-or-less rectangular field behind the school,
stood Special Blazes and the rabbit who had arrived with him.
Both wore their uniform trousers,
but instead of their jackets they were in plain tunics
no different from a farm hand's.

"Get outta-come on, I wanna see."
Bluster and Bravo shouldered their way through the other children
to stand front and center.

"Oh, there you are.
I didn't see you in class,"
Miz Nabbles said acidly.

"Doin' chores,"
Bluster lied without looking at her.
He elbowed his twin.
"Look at the size of 'em!"

The tiger's ear twitched.
Without warning he crouched and roared.
Everyone jumped,
and a few of the smaller children squeaked.

Special Blazes straightened and bared his teeth in a smile.
"Good morning.
Who can tell me what we just learned?"

"That you're really scary!"
Bluster called,
scowling when Bravo made a kissing sound beside him.

"I try,"
Special Blazes said modestly.
"But the real lesson is surprise.
If you're ever in trouble—if you're ever attacked
by bots or anyone else—try to surprise them.
Do something unexpected.
Like this!"

He scooped up a wooden baton from the grass by his feet
and swung it at his companion's head.
Maddy heard it cut the air,
but the rabbit was faster.
She twisted sideways to avoid the first blow,
ducked to avoid the second,
then threw a kick that would have knocked the tiger halfway across the field
if it had landed.

It didn't.
Instead,
the tiger spun the baton around to knock the blow aside,
then stepped in close and brought his hand up to the rabbit's throat.
"Aaaand you're dead," he said pleasantly.

Some of the children clapped,
Sindy and Gumption among them.
When Maddy scowled at them Gumption looked away
and the younger Roo stuck out her tongue.

"Oh come now,"
Special Blazes said,
"You can do better than that for my friend Thoughtful,
can't you?"

"So here's the second lesson,"
the tiger said as the children applauded.
"Training wins.
Training beats size and speed and everything else you can think of."

"What about tech?"
Bluster asked.

"Even tech,"
Thoughtful said,
a lazy twang in her voice.
She took the baton from Special Blazes,
spun it around,
and settled into fighting stance.

"Come on,"
Gumption muttered,
elbowing Maddy.
"This is pretty neat."

Maddy crossed her arms.
"You think so?
I notice they didn't invite the bot that was hauling the wagon for them.
I wonder how it feels about that."

Whatever Gumption might have said was lost amidst "oohs" and "aahs"
as the tiger's raised fists burst into flame.
He winked at the children,
the roared and threw himself at Thoughtful.
The flurry of punches, kicks, and whirlwind baton strikes that followed
was too fast for Maddy to follow.
Special Blazes threw one fireball after another.
The rabbit batted them aside,
somehow finding time to strike at her opponent in between.

And then Thoughtful threw the baton at Special Blazes' head.
As he ducked,
she bounced forward and grabbed the front of his shirt.
"Gotcha!"

"Woo hoo!" Bluster whooped.
"That was *amazing*!"

"It was certainly well rehearsed,"
a familiar voice said.
Special Leaf had come up behind her
while she was watching the Operators' mock battle.
"It's a pity that real fights aren't so well organized."

Before Maddy could ask him what he knew about real fights,
the old tortoise raised his voice.
"That was very impressive,
Special Blazes,
very impressive indeed.
But if you'll forgive my memory,
I'm a little puzzled.
I thought you travelled with a bear named Meribeth.
No offense to, um, Thoughtful, is it?
No offense, of course, but what happened to her?"

The tiger's smile widened
even as an uncomfortable look flitted across the rabbit's face.
"We parted ways some while back,"
the tiger rumbled.
"Amicably,
I'd say,
but she decided it was time for her to follow her own road."

Miz Nabbles clapped her hands loudly to fill the awkward silence that followed.
"All right, um, thank you,
thank you very much for that.
Now how about we all line up and go *back into the classroom*
and we can ask the Operators about
all the *other* things they know how to do?"

Special Leaf put his hand on Maddy's arm as she started to turn around.
"If he asks you questions, tell him the truth," he muttered.
"Just remember that you don't have to tell *all* the truth."
She nodded,
a little frightened by the intensity in the old tortoise's voice.

She and Gumption join the line behind the goat twins.
"We *got* to be Operators," Bluster told his twin excitedly.
"Did you see how they—blam! blam!"
He threw a couple of punches at the air.

"It was aright,"
Bravo allowed.

"I bet they rehearsed the whole thing,"
Maddy muttered,
remembering what Special Leaf had said.

"Better than drawin' stupid little pictures,"
Bluster shot back.
Maddy scowled but didn't reply.

The children settled into their seats.
Special Blazes stood at the front of the class
with his hands clasped behind his back.
"Now, who has questions?" Miz Nabbles asked.

Hands shot into the air.
How old had Special Blazes been when he became a Operator?
Eighteen, but he'd joined a troop of Junior Operators when he was twelve.
Oh, really?
There wasn't one in Rusty Bridge?
Well, they'd have to fix that, wouldn't they?

Could they see his tech?
Special Blazes looked at Miz Nabbles and tapped his chest.
When she nodded,
he pulled up his shirt.
The children ooh'ed and aah'ed at the glassy lozenge strapped to his furry chest.
"It lets me make fireballs with my feet too," he said as he pulled down his shirt,
"But they're pretty hard on my boots."

Had he ever killed anyone?
"Bluster!"
Miz Nabbles scolded.

"No, no, it's a fair question," Special Blazes said.
"And unfortunately, the answer is 'yes'.
I never set out to,
but sometimes…"
He shrugged, his face solemn.
"Sometimes you have to choose between one life and many."

"What about bots?"
Maddy asked loudly.

"Miz Roo, I presume?"
the tiger said dryly.
"Pleased to make your acquaintance."

"And yours,"
Maddy replied stiffly.
"So, *have* you ever killed any bots?"

"I have *decommissioned* a few," the Operator replied levelly.
"Though I hope never any that didn't deserve it.
But you of all people should know how dangerous rogue bots can be."
His stern gaze swept the classroom.
"Our job is to keep people safe.
Any bot that respects that has nothing to fear from me or any other Operator."

There were more questions,
but finally Miz Nabbles said,
"All right, everyone,
that's all the time we have today."
Twenty-two children minus one groaned.
"You all go out and run around for a bit
and we'll do some arithmetic practice after, aright?"
After another round of groans,
these ones more habitual than sincere,
the children stood and headed for the door,
chattering with excitement.

"Miz Roo?
Could stay behind a moment, please?"
Special Blazes turned to the teacher.
"If it's all right,
I'd like a word with her in private."

"Oh—um, of course."
Miz Nabbles glanced sidelong at Maddy.
"I'll be right outside.
Come along, Sindy Roo, 'private' doesn't include you."

Kangaroos and older sisters are both naturally stubborn.
Put the two together,
and you have someone who can outwait a tiger.
After a few moments the corner of Special Blazes' mouth quirked up.
"Miz Roo,
regarding your question,
I'd like you to know that I would trust Bee Six Vee with my life.
I have in fact done so many times."

"And I trust Dockety and Crusher the same way,"
Maddy retorted sharply.
"My sister would be in Heck right now if they hadn't fought for us.
Makers' Names,
we might *all* be there!"

"Language, please,"
Special Blazes chided.
Then he sighed.
"Listen,
Miz Roo,
I know what you and this town owe them.
But from what Miz Nabbles tells me,
there's more of them every day out at that camp of theirs,
and—"

"Miz Nabbles?"
Maddy interrupted incredulously.
"That's who you been listening to?
Special,
she's as sour as ten-year-old cider!"

The Operator snorted.
"She is that," he allowed.
"But that doesn't mean she's wrong.
There's been more traffic around Heck since your little adventure
than anyone can remember.
The bots getting busy,
well,
that never goes well for the living.
I'm not asking you to spy on them,"
he continued before Maddy could interrupt again.
"I just think it would be best for everyone
if you'd be mindful of what you see and hear."

Maddy met his eyes.
"That depends on who you count as 'everyone', doesn't it?"

The Operator snorted again.
"That old tortoise sure does have a way with people,"
he said,
almost to himself,
then nodded a farewell and padded silently away.

Gumption was waiting for her
when she hopped angrily out the door a moment later.
"Do you know what he wanted me to do?"
she asked.

"Spy on Dockety an' the others,"
Gumption said.
"I was listenin' from outside the side window,"
he added with a non-apologetic shrug.

She crossed her arms.
"And that don't make you angry?"

"Doesn't matter if it makes me angry or not,"
the young goat said in the oh-so-reasonable voice
that always rubbed her fur the wrong way.
"I mean,
maybe the best thing is to say you'll do it an' then,
you know,
not,
or not really."

She stamped her foot.
"Honestly,
Gumption Goat,
I don't know how to square that with saying you're their friend."

Gumption shrugged.
"Just tryin' to find a way to fit everything together."

Maddy's reply was cut off by the tiger's rumble.
"Give us space, give us space.
My friend here wants a chance to get her self-respect back.
Unless you'd like to show us something?"
he added,
gesturing to Special Leaf.

The tortoise shook his head.
"Oh, come now,"
Special Blazes wheedled.
"It's just dirt.
You can always put it back the way it was."

"Sometimes that's harder to do than you'd think,"
the tortoise replied.

The tiger shrugged as a couple of children said "aww".
"I guess it's just me and you,"
he said to Thoughtful.
"Ready… steady… go!"
The rabbit knocked aside the ball of flame he threw
and threw herself into the fight with a mad grin on her face.
One, two, three—Thoughtful swung her baton again and again
to knock fireballs away
while the tiger dodged her strikes.

"Maddy…"
Sindy said.

"What?"
Maddy snapped.

"Maddy!
Maddy, help!"

Maddy spun around at the panic in her sister's voice.
Just as she did so,
a stream of fire spewed from the tiger's chest.
"Whoa!" Thoughtful shouted,
diving onto the grass.
"What are you doin'?"

"That's not me!"
the tiger roared.

Another jet of flame spurted from his chest.
Children screamed and scattered,
Miz Nabbles with them.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry,"
Sindy said,
panic in her voice.
"I don't know—I can't stop it!
Maddy, I can't stop it!"

*Blam!*
A fireball bigger than Maddy's head flew from his chest
and left a long scorch mark on the schoolyard grass.
Maddy had just a split second to register Thoughtful raise her baton
to swing at Sindy
before the ground split beneath the rabbit's feet,
sending her to her knees.

Special Leaf threw himself in front of Sindy.
"No!" Maddy screamed as another fireball struck the old tortoise,
sending him toppling to the ground.

## Keep Her Safe (Gumption)

Rusty Bridge didn't have a hospital.
Instead,
it had the front room of Doc Whinny's house.
It was as large as the mayor's house,
and well kept,
but people only went through its front door
at the beginning and end of their lives.
For every other visit they went around to the back
and waited on the spacious, shady porch
until they were invited in.

Gumption and Maddy jumped to their feet
when Doc Whinny opened the door.
"Is he aright?" Maddy asked anxiously.
"Is he gonna be aright?"

Doc Whinny took off her glasses
and wiped a speck of dust off them on the sleeve of her pristine white coat.
"He's still with us,"
she said quietly.
"And I expect he'll still be with us tomorrow,
but he's going to have to stay here for quite some time.
And that burn on his shell…"
She blew on her classes and seated them on her face once again.
"Don't suppose you know if he has people somewhere we could write to?"

Gumption reached for Maddy's hand,
then stuffed his hand back into his pocket when she hugged herself.
"Can we see him?"

The doctor nodded.
"He's been asking for you.
Just a minute or two, mind—he needs to rest."

Inside,
the house smelled like flowers,
with an undertone of the extra-strong vinegar
that the doctor used as disinfectant.
Doc Whinny's husband nodded at the two teenagers,
then bent his graying head over his account book again.
"Only a minute or two,"
the doctor repeated as Gumption and Maddy climbed the stairs.

Someone,
years ago,
had cut away most of the wall between two small bedrooms
to make one larger room.
The morning light pouring through its twin windows
made the whitewashed walls glow,
and Gumption thought that under other circumstances
Maddy would have insisted on pulling out her sketch book
and trying to capture the flowers on the little table beside the bed.

She wouldn't have wanted to draw the bed's occupant, though.
Special Leaf looked older and weaker than Gumption would have imagined possible.
With his glasses off and his mouth slack,
only his slow breathing showed that they hadn't arrived too late.

But then he turned his head and opened his eyes.
"Well," he rasped,
"Isn't this a mess?"

Maddy's mouth worked, but no words came.
This time Gumption *did* take her hand and squeeze it.
"Glad you're still with us," he said,
swallowing the catch in his throat.

The old tortoise nodded,
his eyes fluttering.
"Mostly.
Close run thing, though."
He coughed.
"Been a while since I did anything like that.
Out of…
Out of practice."

"Sindy wanted me to say thank you,"
Maddy blurted.
"For—for saving her."

Special Leaf nodded again.
"Glad she's aright."
He started to sit up,
then thought the better of it and fell back onto the mattress.
"You two…
You keep an eye on her.
You have to keep her safe.
The Operators…"

"They're talkin' to the mayor right now,"
Gumption said.
"Special Blazes already said that what happened ain't her fault.
Didn't sound like they were gonna lock her up or anythin'."

Special Leaf coughed and shook his head.
"That's—that's not it.
They'll take her.
They'll take her if they can.
You mustn't let them…
Not again…"

His voice trailed off.
Gumption exchanged a worried look with Maddy.
"Special?
Special, you aright?"

"No, he's not,"
Doc Whinny said,
pushing past them and putting her hand on the tortoise's forehead.
"That's as much as he can do right now.
You two are welcome to come back tomorrow,
but we have to let him rest."

Gumption put his hand on Maddy's shoulder.
"Let's go," he said quietly.

She shook him off,
wiped her face on her sleeve,
and turned and left without a word.
After one last look at Special Leaf,
Gumption followed her.

His heart sank as he stepped outside.
Of *course* Miz Nabbles just happened to be walking past the doctor's house
with a solicitous look on her face.
As she crossed the narrow road,
he wondered how many times she had gone back and forth
so that she could accidentally bump into them.

"Afternoon', Miz Nabbles," he said politely.

"Good afternoon, Mister Goat.
Miz Roo.
I take it you've been up to see the victim?
How is he?"

Gumption shrugged
"Doc Whinny says he's gonna make it,
but he needs rest,
so we,
um,
we're just headin' home to do chores."

"Well,
of course I'm glad the Special is going to be aright.
Terrible thing, just terrible.
Imagine if Sindy had done this to one of the other children."

"Sindy didn't *do* anything,"
Maddy snapped.
"It was an accident!"

Miz Nabbles sniffed.
"Of course,
of course it was an accident,
but she's the one who caused it, isn't she?
Not that anyone is really surprised.
After all,
there was always something a little… *odd* about your sister."

*Please please please don't start a fight,*
Gumption thought hopelessly,
but Maddy's hands were already balled into fists.
"You take that back!
There ain't nothing wrong with my sister!"

Miz Nabbles' eyes widened in mock surprise.
"Dear me,
I didn't say there was anything *wrong*.
But being a special and not telling anyone about it…
And being able to control someone else's tech—why,
I've never heard of anything like it."

"Anyway,"
she continued as Maddy started to say something that
Gumption was sure they'd both regret,
"The mayor has been looking for you.
She's obviously quite worried about all of this.
Perhaps you should go and speak to her?"

"Thanks, Miz Nabbles, we'll do that,"
Gumption said hastily.
"Come on, Maddy."

Maddy rounded on him ten steps and a corner later.
"Well *that* went well," she said,
her voice full of vinegar.

Gumption sighed.
"You know how she is."

"I'm not talking about her,"
Maddy snapped.
"You should have said something!"

"Like what?"
Gumption snapped back.

"Anything!"
Maddy spluttered.
"Seriously,
is there anything you *will* stand up for?"

*You,* he thought,
but didn't say.
They walked the rest of the way to the mayor's house in silence.

The ground floor of the mayor's house was one big open room.
"Big enough for all my friends," Mayor Lupus was fond of saying.
"But not enough for your opinion of yourself,"
Miz Nabbles had once been heard to mutter.
Gumption had been in the room once a year for the end-of-school celebration,
but had never been upstairs before.
Climbing the stairs felt like going from morning to evening.
Dark wood instead of brightly-painted walls,
portraits of previous mayors with serious looks on their faces
(he wondered if any had been painted by Papa Roo),
and actual carpets on the floor—it made him wish he'd had a bath that morning,
or at least the day before.

If anything,
the mayor's office was even more intimidating,
not least because Special Blazes and Mama Roo were sitting there with her.
Special Blazes had changed out of his singed tunic,
but had left the collar of his uniform jacket unbuttoned.
Mama Roo was in her usual gingham dress,
with her knees pressed together and her hands in her lap
and the same stubborn expression on her face
that Maddy wore so often.

Nobody offered Gumption and Maddy a seat.

The questions started immediately.
How long had the teens known about Sindy's ability?
Had Special Leaf known?
Had she ever controlled *his* tech?
Or anything else?
What about Dockety and the other bots—did they know about this?

Growing up in a large family had given Gumption
a lot of opportunities to practice playing dumb.
Maddy wasn't nearly as good at dodging questions,
but the only time he tried to take one for her
she gave him a glare that would have curdled vinegar.
Yes, they'd known,
but not that she could do *this*.
No,
they'd never seen her use Special Leaf's tech—they didn't even know that was possible.
(Which wasn't exactly a lie, but still made Gumption uncomfortable.)
As for the bots,
they weren't part of this.

Finally Special Blazes leaned back in his chair.
"I know this is difficult,"
he rumbled,
"But we can't help her if we don't know what help she needs."

"So you're going to help her now?"
Maddy muttered.

"Maddy Roo, your manners,"
Mama Roo said curtly.

Maddy scowled.
"Sorry, mama."

Special Blazes exchanged a look with the mayor.
"Well,
I don't think we have much choice.
We're going to have to take Sindy to headquarters at Sandy Bend for testing.
No, no, hear me out, please."
He raised a paw to cut off the Roos' objections.
"It isn't up to me, or the mayor, or you either.
It's regulations.
Any time someone shows special abilities,
they have to be tested and registered.
Leaf was,
I was,
and now it's your daughter's turn.
It's for everyone's safety,
including hers."

Mama Roo argued,
of course,
but it had no more effect than arguing with the rain.
Gumption kept expecting Maddy to chime in as well,
but she just stared at the floor.
If not for how tightly her hands were clenched in her lap,
he would have thought she was sitting through
one of Miz Nabbles' homilies on tidiness.

"All right,"
Mama Roo finally said.
"I'll tell her."

Special Blazes nodded.
"Thank you, ma'am.
We'll head out tomorrow—no,
please,
it's for the best.
No need to drag this out.
We'll head out tomorrow,
and she'll be back before you know it."

Standing on the porch a couple of minutes later,
Gumption cleared his throat.
"Well, I guess you gotta go get her ready."

Mama Roo nodded.
There was gray in her fur, Gumption noticed.
When had that happened?
"Thank you, Gumption.
Come on, Maddy."
She squeezed her daughter's shoulders.

Gumption half-hoped Maddy would invite him to come with them,
but she just said,
"See you tomorrow,"
so he nodded and said,
"See ya,"
and watched them walk away.

He knew he should go straight home,
but instead he hopped over the split cedar fence
that marked the back of the Roos' yard.
A crow scolded him from a tree
as he swung himself over another fence
onto a dirt path that ran through the trees.
It was muddy but he didn't slow down,
not even when his feet almost went out from under him
on a slippery patch near a stream so small
that even the children didn't have a name for it.

Nobody in Rusty Bridge knew quite what to call
the home that Dockety and its fellow bots had built.
Was "camp" the right word for buildings with concrete floors and proper roofs?
Gumption had overheard some people refer to it as "Bots' End",
and he hoped the name would stick.
It was just a a dozen structures ranging in size
from a garden shed to half the size of the Roos' house,
all arranged in a circle around a black charging post—but
Rusty Bridge was just a place too.

Dockety was cleaning the muck out of Crusher's treads with a heavy brush when Gumption arrived.
"It says you are better at this than any bot,"
Dockety told Gumption.
"Even better than this one."

"Yeah?
Well, I'm glad I'm good for something."
He took the brush from Dockety and patted Crusher's side.
"Got a right mess of muck in here.
Been clearing brush with Zeke again?"

"Confirmed," the hauler bot flashed on its screen.
The word dissolved into happy sparkles
as Gumption began scrubbing mud and leaves out of its treads.

As he worked,
he told Dockety what had happened.
"Special Blazes is right," the bot said when he finished.
"Your regulations require her to be assessed.
Her only alternative is to flee,
but the Operators will be prepared for that."

"Have you ever had a run-in with 'em?"
Gumption asked,
flipping the brush over to pry a rock out of Crusher's treads with its handle.

Dockety's lenses rotated.
"We would probably not be having this conversation
if this one had run in with them.
They do not approve of free bots."

Gumption nodded and went back to brushing.
Sparkles drifted across Crusher's screen with each scrape.
If the hauler bot had been a cat,
Gumption would have said it was purring.

He was almost done by the time Dockety spoke again.
"You could perform that task more efficiently."

"Probably,"
Gumption admitted,
feeling stung.

"But you would require training,"
Dockety continued.
"There is a school for mechanics in Sandy Bend.
We could make the journey at the same time as the Operators take Miz Roo for evaluation.
That would be—"
It hesitated.
"Innocuous,"
it finally said.

Gumption straightened up patted Crusher's side.
"That's a good idea,
but I can't afford any kind o' Sandy Bend school."

"We would offer salvage to compensate the school,"
Dockety said neutrally.

Gumption shook his head.
"I can't ask you to do that.
You need it for repairs an' stuff."

"You do not have to ask.
You are this one's friend."

Gumption patted Crusher's side again as "FRIEND" flashed on the hauler bot's screen.
"Thanks,"
Gumption said awkwardly.
"Lemme see what my folks think."

What Gumption's parents thought was that his ribs still weren't properly healed
and said that he needed to finish school in Rusty Bridge before he could go anywhere.
Voices were raised after that
and a younger brother was sent next door
to ask Gumption's grandma to come by and talk some sense into him.
Once half a dozen relatives were arguing on the porch
about whether Gumption's great uncle had ever owned a mitre saw
he slipped away unnoticed and headed to the Roos' house.
His conversation with Dockety had given him an idea.

## Tears in the Kitchen (Maddy)

Maddy, Sindy, and Mama Roo sat in their usual chairs in the kitchen.
Gumption leaned against the frame of the door.
Maddy hadn't exactly invited him,
but she hadn't told him to leave either,
even though she was half-minded to.

"Everyone was talking about how they wanted to be Operators,
and I thought—"
Sindy hiccuped
and another tear rolled down her furless cheeks.
"I didn't *want* to.
It just kind of woke up."

"Sh sh sh."
Mama Roo took her daughter's hand.
"It's aright.
You didn't do anything wrong."

"But Special Leaf is gonna *die*!" she wailed.

"Special Leaf isn't going to die,"
Maddy said firmly.

"But they're gonna take me *away*!"
She jumped out of her chair and wrapped her arms around her mother.
"I have to go to and be tested
and they're going to find out about,"
hiccup,
"About *everything*."

"Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad thing,"
Gumption ventured.

"I beg your pardon?"
Maddy said icily.

Gumption shrugged.
"My Aunt Dorilee says that if folks know half a story,
the best thing is to tell 'em the rest of it
instead of letting 'em make up something worse.
Everyone knows she's special now—lettin' the Operators test her
just makes it official."

"That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard,"
Maddy said curtly.
She knew that it wasn't,
and that none of what was happening was Gumption's fault,
but she felt so *angry*.

Mama Roo squeezed Sindy once more and straightened up in her chair.
"We shouldn't decide anything on empty stomachs,"
Mama Roo said.
"It won't take but a few minutes to pack,
so Maddy,
if you'd like to get some carrots—no,
don't make that face.
I know we had them last night—"

"And the night before,"
Maddy muttered.

"—but we'll put some salt and rosemary on them this time
and they'll taste brand new."
Mama Roo stood up,
brisk and confident now that she had something to do.
"Sindy,
can you go pick some herbs out of the garden?
And Gumption,
you're very welcome to stay if you want."

"Thank you,
but I oughta be gettin' home."
He tousled Sindy's hair.
"You'll be aright.
You Roos are pretty tough."
He stepped aside to let Sindy past,
nodded to Maddy and Mama Roo,
and then closed the door quietly behind him.

The clock on the counter ticked a dozen times.
"Maddy?"
Mama Roo said.
"The carrots?"

Maddy took a deep breath.
"I'm going to go with Sindy.
Wait, no, please, hear me out—please?
The newspaper is going to publish one of my pictures.
They're not paying me for it,
but maybe if I go and show them what else I can do
they'll take me on or give me piecework,
and you know we can use the money,
and that Sindy won't have to—"

Mama Roo shook her head.
"No.
I'll send a letter with her for Cousin Ramble—I'm sure
she can stay with him and his family,
and then you and I can go get her in a few days."

"But Mama—"

"I said no."
Mama Roo's refusal sounded as hard as stone and just as likely to bend.
"I already asked the mayor if I could go,
but apparently there are rules about these things.
The Operators will take care of her."

It sounded more like a wish in Maddy's ears than a prediction.
She hesitated.
Should she tell mer mother Special Leaf's warning?
But if she did,
what exactly would she say?

So instead she said, "Yes, mama,"
and got the carrots out of the vegetable box
and started peeling them
as if they were kindling to be chopped.

Mama Roo tried her best to be cheerful during dinner.
Maddy tried to play along,
but all the while her thoughts were elsewhere.
Once dishes were washed
and her mother and sister lying side-by-side in Sindy's narrow bed,
Maddy closed the door to her tiny bedroom and began to pack her bag.
Her sketchbook and two pencils,
clean underwear,
her other dress,
a toothbrush she had bought to give her mother for her birthday…
It hardly seemed adequate for running away from home,
but she had survived the Mire and escaped from Patient's lair with less.

She crept down the stairs as quietly as she could,
being careful not to step on the one that always squeaked,
tiptoed through the kitchen,
and nearly jumped out of her skin when she opened the door.

"Hi,"
Gumption whispered loudly.

"Hi,"
Maddy replied curtly.

He jerked his chin toward the knapsack in her hand.
"Runnin' off to join the circus?"

"Maybe,"
she hissed.
"Maybe they'd have clowns that are actually as funny as they think they are."

The young goat's face fell.
"I'm just tryin' to help."

Maddy sighed again.
"I know.
I just—I can't let her go off on her own,
not after what Special Leaf said."

"Mm hm.
Problem is,
they ain't stupid.
If you're not there to say goodbye when she leaves tomorrow,
they're gonna know somethin's up."
And then he grinned.
"So here's my plan…"

Hours later,
once her mother and Sindy were asleep,
Maddy crept downstairs again.
She and Gumption walked in silence to Zeke Bear's barn,
where the Operators had parked their wagon.
"You sure their bot's not in there?" Maddy whispered.

Gumption nodded.
"It's rechargin',
same as Able does when it's got a long trip and a load to haul.
C'mon."

It took them an hour to unload enough boxes to make a space in the back of the wagon.
Once there was room for them,
they wrestled a board into place to serve as a roof for their little cave,
stowed their bags,
and re-packed everything on top of their newly-made hiding place.
After some more whispers of,
"No, not that one, *that* one,"
and,
"The other way around!"
the wagon's contents looked more or less as they had.

"You sure you want to come?"
Maddy asked as they walked back to her house.

"'Course I want to come,"
Gumption said,
pretending to be offended.
"It's my plan, ain't it?"

Maddy was silent for a few paces,
then blurted,
"Look,
she's not your sister,
and none of this is your fault,
and—"

Gumption stopped her.
"You don't have to fix the whole world on your own, Maddy.
Aright?"
She nodded and then punched his shoulder,
feeling a weight lift from hers.

Maddy woke to the sound of her sister's tears
and her mother's soothing voice.
She rubbed the sleep from her eyes and dressed quickly,
cursing the knots in her fur as she tried to brush them out.
She hadn't put a brush in her knapsack,
she realized,
or a bar of soap,
but there wasn't time for that now.

Gumption was waiting for them on their porch.
"Thanks for coming to see her off,"
Mama Roo said gratefully.
He tousled Sindy's hair
and then folded his arms around her awkwardly as she hugged him.
Maddy exchanged an anxious nod with him as they set off.

A handful of people had gathered to see the Operators off.
*And to gawk at Sindy,* Maddy thought angrily
when she spotted Miz Nabbles,
who sniffed and then ignored her.
Mayor Lupus was there too,
listening patiently as Able chatted happily
about how nice it would be to have company on the road,
but at least Bluster and Bravo had stayed away.

"Aright,"
Thoughtful said loudly,
clapping her paws.
"Let's get this show on th' road."

The next few minutes were filled with the noise and bustle of people preparing to travel.
Bee Six Vee clipped the wagon's heavy hitch to its back
while the Operators slung their bags and Sindy's beneath the wagon's bench seat.
"Don't worry, it hauls real smooth,"
the rabbit reassured Sindy.
"And it's fast, too.
We'll be in Sandy Bend in time for lunch tomorrow,
and I know a place along by the river that'll do you the best milkshake in the world."

After one final hug from her mother,
Sindy climbed onto the seat between the two Operators.
"Toot toot!" Able sang out as Bee Six Vee pulled them out of the barn and onto the road.

"You aright?"
Maddy asked her mother.

Mama Roo shook her head.
"Not really, but I will be."
She smiled at her elder daughter.
"I've been getting used to the idea of you leaving ever since you two got back.
Wasn't ready for Sindy to be going instead."

Gumption cleared his throat.
"How about you an' me go see if there's any salvage down by the creek?"
he said off-handedly to Maddy.

"Oh, that's a good idea."
The smile on Mama Roo's face made Maddy want to squirm.
"I'll go see if the Ox brothers want any preserving done.
See you for lunch?"

"Or dinner,"
Maddy said,
hugging her mother
and biting her tongue to stop herself from saying goodbye.
She held herself to a walk until she and Gumption were around the corner,
then broke into a run with him at her heels.

Dockety was waiting for them in the woods five minutes out of town.
"Hey," Maddy panted.

The bot's lenses rotated a quarter-turn with a slight whine.
"Greetings.
Did everything go as planned?"

"So far,"
Gumption said,
bending over and putting his hands on his knees as he tried to catch his breath.
"How 'bout your end?"

"We are ready.
Follow me."

Up a slight rise and down the other side,
the path ended at the Makers' road.
"Hey," Maddy said again,
waving at Crusher and the other bots who stood there.

"HELLO," flashed across the big hauler's screen.
With nothing more than that it pivoted on its heavy treads,
seized a nearby sapling,
and pulled it out of the ground.
Behind it,
the rest of the crew Dockety had assembled began cutting branches
and tossing them onto the road.

The Operators' wagon came around the bend a minute later.
Bee Six Vee slowed from a trot to a walk,
then stopped a few paces away from the pile of brush blocking its way.
Special Blazes and Thoughtful put their heads together to confer quietly for a moment.
"Morning,"
the tiger said after straightening up.
"Mind telling me what you're about?"

"Maintenance," Dockety replied,
its voice buzzing slightly.
"If any of this fell during a storm, it would obstruct the road."

"Mm hm."
Special Blazes nodded.
"Kind of obstructing the road right now, though.
Don't suppose you could do something about that so we can get by?"

As he spoke,
Maddy put her hand on Gumption's shoulder and nodded.
This was their chance to sneak onto the wagon.
He nodded back and started to rise,
then ducked down again.
"Look!" he mouthed,
pointing as Bravo stepped out of the bushes on the other side of the road.

"Whoa, whoa, whoa!" the young goat exclaimed,
raising his hands.

Thoughtful waited a heartbeat before lowering the rifle
that had somehow leaped into her hands.
"Sorry 'bout that,"
she said.
"You startled me."

Special Blazes looked back and forth between Bravo and Dockety.
"You part of this crew?"

"No sir,"
Bravo said,
his hands still in the air.
"I—I figured I could catch you here, is all.
I'd like to volunteer, sir.
To be an Operator.
I already know how to fight,"
he said hurriedly before Special Blazes could reply.
"And I'm tough as anythin'.
Just ask folk, they'll tell you.
And I ain't scared o' bots or nothin'."

"Huh,"
Sindy snorted.
"What about your brother?
Never seen you do anything without his say-so.
You think you'll be all right without him around to tell you what to do?"

Bravo lowered his hands, glowering.
"This ain't none o' your business, Sindy Roo."

"Might not be hers, but it sure is mine,"
Bluster Goat said angrily,
standing up just a few steps away from his brother.

"What're *you* doin' here?"
Bravo spluttered.

"What am *I* doin'?
What're *you* doin'?
You won't last two days on your own!"

"I'll do better than I'll do with you bossin' me around all the time!"

As the two goats began arguing,
Maddy tugged on Gumption's sleeve.
Together,
they crept through the bushes and onto the road behind the wagon.
She winced at the tailboard's squeak as they lowered it.
"Ladies first," Gumption whispered.
She slithered into the gap they had made.
Gumption followed her,
wriggling around awkwardly to pull the tailboard closed again.

"Aright, pipe down!" she heard Special Blazes say.
"You want to join the Operators?
Fine—you go back home and finish school,
and then we'll talk.
Right now,
though,
I'd be obliged if you could help these bots pull some of that brush aside.
We have a lot of ground to cover,
and the day isn't getting any longer."

With matching grumbles the goat twins started work.
A few minutes later Bee Six Vee lurched into a trot
with the wagon,
its passengers,
and the two stowaways behind it.

## Camp and Conversation (Gumption)

The road was bumpier than it looked,
or maybe the wagon's suspension had been designed
for the comfort of the passengers on the bench at the front
rather than stowaways hiding in the back.
Their little box cave was pitch black—the only light
came from a tiny crack between two of the boxes over Gumption's head
and another one between the sideboards next to him.

Gumption tried to stay out of Maddy's way as she wriggled around
in a vain attempt to find a more comfortable position.
Finally he reached down by their feet to grab her satchel
and handed it to her.
"Here," he whispered.
"Try using this for a pillow."
He put his own bag under his head and closed his eyes.
Their little hiding place was already uncomfortably warm,
but he had worked in the fields since he was old enough to pull carrots out of the ground,
and had dozed on a plank bench more than once.
He could get through this—he just hoped Maddy could as well.

An hour out of town
the dirt track beneath them joined the Makers' road.
The ancient black highway was cracked in places,
and the wagon occasionally had to swerve around
clumps of weeds tough enough to have broken through the surface,
but even so,
Bee Six Vee hauled them fast enough that
Gumption could feel how fast they were going.

He peeked through the gap in the sideboards
as they passed under a row of ruined arches that marched from one horizon to the other,
wrapped in creeping vines but still solid.
A half-sunken metal sphere as big as a house was next,
and then a tangle of concrete and bent bars
that the villagers just called "the thing".

The ground on either side of the highway began to grow damp.
The twin smells of rust and rotting vegetation filled his nose
as they approach the polluted swamp known as the Mire.
Somewhere out there was the bunker
where Patient in Darkness had kept Maddy's father prisoners—where
she and Sindy had almost wound up as prisoners too.
Dockety and the other free bots had returned to it once,
but the swamp's tentacled guardian had made the task too risky.

*And now Papa Roo is somewhere a hundred times worse,*
Gumption thought.
He hadn't known Maddy's father well,
but he remembered a warm laugh and jokes so bad you just had to smile.

He elbowed Maddy.
"Hey,"
he whispered.
"Whatcha thinking about?"

After a moment of silence,
she said,
"It's a lot easier in stories, isn't it?
Hiding and stowing away and all that—folk just do it.
Nobody ever says it's hard work."

"Yeah,
and nobody ever talks about the smell,"
Gumption agreed.

"The what?"
A moment later she hissed, "Eww!
Gumption Goat, you're disgusting!"

"Sorry," he whispered cheerfully.
"Mama made chili for dinner, and you know she makes a powerful chili."

"Ssh!"
Maddy elbowed him again.
"Don't do that again.
The Mire's going to be stinky enough."

Silence,
and then Gumption said,
"She's gonna be aright, you know.
Your sister, I mean."

"I know who you mean."
She found his hand in the darkness and squeezed it.
"Thanks for coming with me."

Gumption squeezed back.
"I'd be stuck at home otherwise,
and,
well,
everybody had the same chili I did."

Maddy let go of his hand.
"Do you ever take *anything* seriously?" she whispered.

Gumption shrugged,
very aware of how warm she was beside him
and of how clean her fur smelled.
"Always taken *you* seriously," he said.
"'Cept for that time you tried skating on Weaver's Pond.
You remember that?"
He tsk'ed.
"That was truly spectacular."

He rolled onto his side and propped his head up on his arm.
"'cept than that,
and the time you tried make double-dip cookies but forgot the salt,
and maybe a couple or three other times,
I've pretty much always taken you seriously.
So don't worry—we'll make sure Sindy's aright,
an' then we'll figure out what to do about your pa."

He lay back down.
When Maddy said, "Eww!" again a moment later,
he smiled in the darkness.
Above their heads,
Able the mailbot began to hum a happy tune.

Bee Six Vee pulled off the road just before mid-day.
The wagon bounced a little as the passengers up front climbed down off their bench.
"Go ahead and stretch your legs,"
Thoughtful told Sindy.
"And, uh, if you need a bit o' privacy,
just duck behind those bushes over there."

"Thank you," Gumption heard Sindy reply.
*I could use a bit of privacy myself,* he thought.
*And some lunch.*

As if she had read his mind,
Maddy elbowed him and then passed him a squashed sandwich wrapped in wax paper.
"Thanks," he whispered.
Pickled peaches weren't his favorite,
but his stomach was happy to have them.

He nearly choked on a mouthful when Special Blazes said,
"Enjoying that?"

"Always enjoy a good chew," Thoughtful replied.
Gumption whooshed silently,
exchanging a look with Maddy.
"Little bit worried about the time we're makin', though.
Shoulda been here half an hour ago."

"Isn't like Bee to run slow," the tiger rumbled.

Peeking through the sideboards,
Gumption caught half of Thoughtful's shrug.
"It says the wagon feels heavy."

Special Blazes snorted.
"Always does when we're carrying a load like this.
Come on—let's get rolling."

The afternoon was worse than the morning.
Their hiding spot went from uncomfortably warm to almost unbearably stuffy,
and Gumption's injured ribs ached each time a wheel hit a pothole.
The worst part was his bladder,
but there was nothing he could do about any of it
so he just lay there and listened to Able's humming.
It wasn't much of an adventure,
but he supposed real adventures never were.

Finally Special Blazes said,
"Aright, let's stop here."
Bee Six Vee pulled the wagon off the road again
to stop under a stand of willows that had grown up around a black glass charging post.

The wagon bounced once again as its passengers dismounted.
"How about we scout around a bit and see what's what?"
Special Blazes said to Thoughtful.

"Sure, boss."
Thoughtful stretched until something cracked in her back.
"Ah, that's better.
How about I do that,
then you an' I can set up your tent?"
she said to Sindy.

"Aright," the younger Roo replied with a yawn.
"Are we going to have dinner, too?
I'm hungry."

"Best road stew you've ever eaten,"
the rabbit promised.
"I'll be back to get a fire started in no time."

"I really need to pee," Maddy whispered as Thoughtful walked away,
her rifle in her hands.
"Like, *really*."

Gumption nodded and peeked through the sideboard again.
Able and Bee Six Vee were together by the charging post.
Sindy had picked up some loose pebbles and was tossing them into the little creek
that ran past the willows,
and Special Blazes was nowhere to be seen.
He twisted around,
wincing at the stabbing in his ribs,
unlatched the backboard,
and winced again as it squeaked when he lowered it.

"Quick as you can,"
he muttered to Maddy.

"I know, I know,"
she muttered back.
They ran on tiptoes for the nearest bushes.

Two minutes later they were back in the wagon.
A minute after that he heard Thoughtful and Special Blazes return.
"See anything?" the tiger asked.

"Couple o' little bots, but they ran off,"
Thoughtful replied.
"I figure they were just wantin' to recharge."

"Mm.
Where there's little ones, there's usually big ones,"
Special Blazes rumbled.

Thoughtful patted her rifle.
"I'll keep watch.
Now, Miz Roo?
You want to come over here and help me with your tent,
and then we'll start that stew?"

The rabbit chatted as she banged pegs into the ground,
seemingly not bothered by Sindy's curt replies.
"There."
She stood back and admired her handiwork.
"Nice and snug."

"Looks like you done this a lot,"
Sindy said resentfully.

"Oh, plenty o' times.
My folks were travellers—I practically grew up on the road.
They were always findin' stuff here, sellin' it there.
Never stayed in one place for long."

"They still on the road?"
Sindy asked,
plucking on one of the tent strings.

Thoughtful shook her head.
"Naw.
They,
uh,
well,
they're gone now.
We had a run-in with some pretty bad folks a few years back
and they didn't make it."

"I'm sorry."
Sindy sniffled suddenly and hugged herself.
"Did you say there was going to be stew?"

"Sure is.
Come on—you help me get the fire started and it'll be ready in no time."

The smell of cooking made Gumption's stomach rumble so loudly
that he had to press a fist into his belly to quiet it.
Afterward,
he hummed along as Able sang Sindy a lullaby.
"Sow, sow, sow your oats,
right beside your beans…"

"G'night," Maddy whispered once they could hear Sindy's gentle snores.

"G'night," he whispered back.

He lay beside her in the darkness,
one arm under his head,
and thought about Bluster and Bravo both trying to run away to join the Operators
without telling one another.
They'd bullied him ever since they were little,
and he didn't much care if he ever saw either of them again,
but he couldn't help feeling a little bit of sympathy for them
wanting to go and see the world.

He had known since the first day he met Maddy that she was going to.
He had been trying all summer to figure out how to tell her that it was aright,
that he understood she needed more than Rusty Bridge could offer
and that he wouldn't mind her leaving him behind,
but he could never find the right words.
Plus,
he had promised her once that he'd never lie to her.

The Operators' voices startled him out of his semi-doze.
"Want me to take first watch?"
Thoughtful asked.

"Sure."
Special Blazes slurped the last of his tea and dumped the dregs on the ground.
"You sure you're up for this job?
I'm just asking because you seem to be getting pretty fond of Miz Roo."

"Don't worry about me, boss,"
the rabbit protested.
"I can do what I need to when the time comes."

"Mm,"
Special Blazes rumbled.
"That's what Meribeth said,
and look how that played out.
There's no shame at all if you decide it's not your road.
I just need to know."

"I can do what I need to,"
Thoughtful repeated firmly.
Special Blazes clapped her on the shoulder and turned away.

It took Gumption a long time to fall asleep after that.

## The Observatory (Maddy)

"Mmph?" Gumption mumbled as the wagon started to roll the next morning.

"Ssh!"
Maddy clamped her hand over his mouth.
Her mouth tasted *awful*,
and her neck—she realized that she had never really appreciated pillows properly before.

Gumption wriggled away from under her
and peered through the gap in the sideboards.
"I can't see anyone,"
he whispered.
A moment later they both rolled their eyes
as Able started humming a happy tune above them.

"I don't know if I can get through another day of this,"
Maddy grumbled.

Gumption rolled onto his back and pillowed his arms beneath his head.
"Yes you can,"
he said quietly,
his eyes already closed.
A moment later he was asleep again.

Maddy sighed.
"Don't worry, I'll wake us up when we get somewhere,"
she muttered.
*Or if they stop for a toilet break,*
she added in her head.

The sun was high when they turned off the Makers' road onto a smaller one.
What had once been two smooth lanes with knee-high concrete barriers on each side
was now a stream bed in some places
and a jigsaw puzzle in others.
The road climbed, dipped, and climbed again
until they reached the summit of a tall hill overlooking the Mire.

A single building stood there,
its domed metal roof stained with rust but still intact.
The waist-high bushes around it were dry and brittle,
and the grass below them brown instead of green.
Scattered pickets of larch and pine stood guard,
their branches swaying gently in the wind.

"Whoa up!"
Thoughtful called,
hopping down from her seat as Bee Six Vee slowed and stopped.
Leaning awkwardly over Gumption to look through the sideboard,
Maddy saw Special Blazes climb from the wagon bench.
The tiger arched his back and rolled his head from side to side,
then consulted a heavy pocket watch.
"Half an hour," he declared.
"Thoughtful, you keep an eye out while I get the solars set up."

It only took the travellers a few minutes to settle in.
Special Blazes laid out the solar panels in a line,
connecting one cable to them and others to Able and Bee Six Vee.
Thoughtful unfolded a camp chair
and took a moment to assemble a tripod for her long-barrelled rifle,
then sat down and began scanning the road below them
through its telescopic sight
in smooth, unhurried sweeps.

Maddy nudged Gumption.
"I gotta get out for a minute."
He nodded,
his bladder clearly as uncomfortable as hers.

Slowly,
gingerly,
they lowered the backboard.
Maddy poked her head out cautiously.
No one was in sight.
Digging her elbows into the boards,
she dragged herself forward until she could reach the hitch
at the back of the wagon.
If she braced herself on that—

"Would you like a hand getting down?"
Special Blazes was standing by the back corner of the wagon
with a freshly-brewed cup of tea in his hand.
He nodded,
solemn-faced,
at Maddy's polite,
"No thank you,"
and sipped his drink as she lowered herself awkwardly to the ground,
stood,
and brushed her skirt back into place.

"Must've been mighty warm in there,"
he observed.

"It wasn't so bad.
Um, if you'll excuse me a moment…?"

"By all means."
The Operator waved her toward the bushes.

Back straight and head held high,
Maddy got three steps toward the bushes when a small voice said,
"Excuse me."
Maddy opened and closed her mouth as her sister marched past her,
the expression on her face saying more clearly than words how angry she was.
Maddy sighed.
This day just couldn't get any worse.

When she, Sindy, and Gumption were done their business
they joined the rest of the party,
who were sitting or standing near the front of the wagon
depending on their inclination and body shape.
"It ain't the stupidest thing anyone's ever done,"
Thoughtful said,
"But it sure ain't the smartest."

Special Blazes nodded.
"We'll send word back to your folks as soon as we get to Sandy Bend.
They must be worried sick.
Meanwhile,
why don't you give 'em the tour?"
He nodded at the domed building.
"It was solid enough the last time I passed through."

Thoughtful pursed her lips.
"Makers' work ain't for the likes of children."

"We're not children,"
Maddy protested,
but the rabbit had already shouldered her rifle.

A sign stood in front of the domed building,
but time and weather had long since erased whatever it had once said.
There was just enough room between the double doors for Thoughtful to squeeze through.
The children followed single file.

The rabbit took a small glowball from her pocket and held it up.
Its cool blue-white light threw sharp shadows.
Maddy shivered.
The last place she had been in that looked like this
had been Patient's bunker in the Mire.
The air here was cool and dry instead of dank,
but her steps echoed exactly the same way on the tiled floor.

"This way."
Thoughtful led them past rooms with broken doors
whose contents had long since been salvaged.
Every few paces they passed pillars
that Maddy realized must once have been display cases.

The corridor took them to a broad flight of stairs.
The room waiting at their top filled the entire second story of the building.
Daylight poured through a wide gap in the domed roof
to reveal something that looked like a metal log lying on the floor.
Someone had swept the scattering of dry leaves and twigs around it
into piles by the walls.

"What is that?"
Maddy asked.

"It was a telescope,"
Thoughtful explained.
"The Makers used to like to look at the stars.
Here, you see?"
She walked around to one end.
"Once upon a time there would have been a lens in there,
so if you sat in the chair back there
you could look at the whole sky"
She sighed.
"It must have been quite something.
But that's not what I wanted to show you.
Look here."

She picked her way past the piled-up leaves
to a window positioned under the gap in the roof.
A boxy wooden bench stood beneath the window.
With a grunt,
Thoughtful lifted the bench seat and propped it open,
then reached inside and pulled out a telescope the length of her arm
and a little tripod like the one she had set up in camp for her rifle.

"You've been here before, haven't you?"
Maddy said as the rabbit pointed the telescope through the broken window
and fiddled with the lens on the viewing end.

"Been a lot of places,"
she replied absently.
"Here, take a look."

Maddy squinted to line her eye up with the lens properly,
then gasped.
In the distance she could see dozens of tall building connected by elevated walkways.
Pipes and cables criss-crossed the scene,
and in the center was a blocky gray building
with an enormous dish antenna on its roof.
She was looking at Heck.

And it was full of bots—more bots than Maddy could have imagined.
Some were so big that they could have rolled over Crusher without noticing it.
Others picked their way through the streets on thin stilt legs
or buzzed from building to building beneath one, two, or half a dozen rotors.

"What are they all doing?"
she asked as Gumption took his turn.

Thoughtful twitched her whiskers.
"Keepin' busy.
Busy enough to leave folk alone, I hope."

"I thought it'd be smoky an' all,"
Gumption offered,
relinquishing the telescope to Sindy.
"Like in the stories."

Thoughtful twitched her whiskers again.
"Some people say the Makers left because the world had become too dirty for them to live in.
Others say the Makers were the ones who made it that way.
Whichever story you like,
the bots they left behind tend to like things tidy."

They each took another turn,
but the scene was too unnerving to watch for long.
*Papa's down there somewhere,* Maddy thought despondently.
*And now I'm going to lose Sindy too.*

They made their way back to the wagon in silence.
As they approached,
Special Blazes held up a kettle.
"Anyone want to join me?"
as Thoughtful seated herself in her camp chair
and put her rifle back on its tripod.

"I would, except I don't drink,"
Able replied cheerfully.

Before Maddy could add anything,
Thoughtful's foot thumped against the ground in a rapid *pat-a-tat-tat*
and she let loose a string of profanity that set Maddy's ears back against her head.
"Trouble, boss,"
she said urgently.
"We got airborne comin' in fast!"

## Taken (Gumption)

Special Blazes put two fingers in his mouth and whistled loudly.
"Power up," he ordered Bee Six Vee.
"We got work to do."

"And you,"
he continued,
rounding on Sindy, Maddy, and Gumption.
"You get into the trees and keep your heads down.
Understood?
You too,"
he added,
waving Able toward the trees.

"Wait!"
Gumption protested.
"I can fight!
I've been practicin'!"

The tiger and Thoughtful exchanged looks.
"This isn't a story, son,"
the rabbit said,
with a hardness in her voice that hadn't been there a moment before.
"You stay with your friends and keep outta trouble."
But then she reached under the wagon's bench seat
to pull out a squat wide-mouthed gun and pass it to the young goat.

"You know how to use this?"
she asked.

"Yes'm," Gumption said.
"Point it at the bad guy and pull the trigger."

Special Blazes shrugged out of his uniform jacket.
The tech on his arms lit up
as Thoughtful shouldered her rifle.

Crouching behind a stand of larch trees a few moments later,
Gumption could smell the dry earth under his feet,
the soap that Mama Roo used on her children,
and the sweat in his armpits.
Beside him,
Maddy put an arm around her sister's shoulders and squeezed.

"Here they come,"
Gumption said as half a dozen dark dots in a vee zoomed closer.

The helibots' rotors whined and then shrieked as they dove at the camp.
White sparks danced across their bellies.
Gumption heard the *rat a tat tat* of their guns a moment later
as puffs of dirt spattered from the ground.

*Chonk!*
A white streak lanced up from where Thoughtful had sheltered beside the wagon.
Her shot went straight through one of the attackers.
The bot tumbled end over end before breaking apart.
"Woo hoo!"
Gumption whooped as smoldering fragments fell to the ground.

The other bots split formation and zipped away in opposite directions,
circled around,
and then came in for a second pass at right angles to each other.
*Chonk!*
Thoughtful's second shot nicked one of them off center.
Its rotors whined as it vainly tried to right itself
before crashing into the trees
and exploding with a muffled *whump!*

"That's two!" Gumption shouted.
He gripped the shotgun that Thoughtful had given him.
He had never actually fired a gun before,
but he'd read about them in Special Leaf's books
and in newspaper stories.
If any of the helibots came close—

The acrid tang of smoke tickled Gumption's nose.
He spun around.
The bot that had crashed behind them had set the dry brush alight.
"The water tank!"
Gumption pointed at the back of the wagon.

"No!"
Maddy snapped,
grabbing his overalls as he started forward.
"If we're still here in five minutes
we can worry about it then."

Gumption shook her off angrily.
"Lemme go!"

But even as he said it Able bleated,
"Oh no! Look!"

A fresh wave of bots had appeared on the far side of the clearing
where the road reached the observatory plateau.
These weren't all made to the same pattern like the helibots.
These were rag-tag machines
like the ones Patient in Darkness had cobbled together out of spare parts.
One-, two-, and three-wheeled scouts raced forward,
changing direction erratically to avoid potholes and gunfire.
The two bots behind them were as large as Bee Six Vee,
squat and heavily armored,
with four thick legs and two crab arms for fighting.

*Chonk!*
Thoughtful's shot pinged off one of the crab tanks.
*Chonk!*
His second shot knocked over one of the little scouts.
It tumbled,
righted itself with spindly mis-matched arms,
and raced toward them again.

Special Blazes braced himself,
brought his hands together,
and *pushed*.
The lead crab tank braked hard but couldn't dodge the enormous white fireball.
The impact knocked the bot onto its side.
One of its armored claws immediately punched the ground.
The crab tank heaved itself upright,
shook itself like a wet cat,
and rolled implacably forward.

*Crack!*
A scout bot exploded as another of Special Blazes' fireballs
found a gap in its thin carapace,
throwing scraps of metal in all directions.
The other scouts scattered like startled chickens.

But "in all directions" meant "toward the trees".
"Run!" Maddy yelled,
grabbing Sindy's arm.

*Uh uh,*
Gumption thought grimly.
He raised the gun that Thoughtful had given him and fired.

*Boom!*
A wire spiderweb burst wide in the air and wrapped around the scout bot.
The wires sparked and sizzled.
The bot careened off course,
crashed into a tree,
and toppled over on its side to lie still.

*Szzt!*
Special Blazes' fireball found its target,
but the crab tank knew to brace itself.
The fireball bounced across the broken ground and evaporated unnoticed.
Another fireball,
then another,
and then the first crab tank had reached the wagon.

*We're done for!*
Gumption thought,
panic rising in his throat.
But he had reckoned without Bee Six Vee.
The squat mulebot slammed into the attacker's side
with a clang he was sure they must have heard
all the way back in Rusty Bridge.

As the crab tank scrabbled to regain its footing,
Bee Six Vee rammed it again,
grabbed one of its legs,
and twisted.
Special Blazes flung a stream of fire straight into the crab tank's joints.
One second, two…
Smoke and flame burst out of the bot's rear.
Bee Six Vee tossed the ruined bot aside contemptuously.

"Look out!" Able called out.
Gumption fired again,
tangling another scout bot.

"Help me!"
Gumption yelled at Able,
sprinting into the clearing.
He kicked the blocks away from its rear wheels,
put his shoulder against the backboard,
and pushed.

The wagon began to roll forward.
Slowly, slowly…
"Oh, come on!" Gumption shouted as the mailbot fled,
squeaking and buzzing in panic.

*Chonk!*
*Crack!*
Shots and fireballs kept the remaining scouts at bay,
but not the second crab tank.
It grabbed Bee Six Vee and staggered around
to put the mulebot between it and Special Blazes.
Metal shrieked as the crab tank's claws tightened.
The mulebot's legs left gouges in the ground as it was pushed back,
closer and closer to the defenders' trench.

*Szzt!*
A fireball caught the crab tank's leg.
It staggered for a moment,
but a moment was all Bee Six Vee needed.
It grabbed the crab tank with its brawny arms
and flipped it over
for Special Blazes to finish off.

Gumption whooped as the last of the scout bots fled.
"We did it! We did it! We—hey, what are you doing here?"
He goggled as Dockety rolled toward him,
dragging Able behind it.

"It's… not as bad… as it looks," the mailbot said weakly.
Lubricant was leaking out of a matched pair of holes in its front and back.
Its single arm twitched, froze, and twitched again.

"No, it is worse,"
Dockety buzzed.
"This one is badly damaged."

Special Blazes pointed his clenched fists at the new arrival.
"What are *you* doing here?" he demanded.

"This one thought that Miz Roo might require assistance,"
the bot buzzed.

Special Blazes didn't lower his fists.
"And you just happened to catch up with us at the same time as this lot?
That's mighty convenient."
Gumption gulped as Thoughtful swung her rifle around and took aim at Dockety.

Dockety's lenses rotated.
"This one played no part in the attack."

The moment stretched,
and then Special Blazes lowered his fists.
"Can you do anything for it?"
he asked curtly, gesturing at Able.

"No.
There is nothing anyone can do for it now."
Dockety's tone sent a shiver down Gumption's spine.

"That's too bad—it had a good singing voice.
Bee! Get yourself hitched to the wagon.
Make sure the rest of this lot are out of commission."
Special Blazes kicked the burned-out crab bot nearest the wagon.
"Who in the Makers' names *are* they?"

That was when Gumption heard Sindy scream,
"Maddy!"
He whirled around just in time to see
one of the helibots that had escaped earlier
rise into the air
with the older Roo sister dangling in its claws.

Thoughtful raised her rifle.
"No!"
Gumption knocked it aside,
sending her shot into the trees.

"Help her!
Help her!
You gotta get her back!"
Sindy wailed,
but there was nothing anyone could do.

## A Familiar Voice (Maddy)

Maddy had flown twice before:
once when she, Dockety, and Sindy escaped from
the bunker where Patient in Darkness had enslaved so many bots,
and once on her own when she went back to free them.
She had been terrified both times.
Kangaroos didn't like heights.
She didn't even climb trees except on a dare
or when Sindy had taken her sketchbook and wouldn't give it back.

Dangling beneath a helibot that was clearly struggling with her weight
was therefore the sort of thing that would happen to her in a bad dream.
She struggled and screamed for help
when the bot's mechanical claws dug into her shoulders.
After that,
she grabbed the bot's cold metal wrists and shouted,
"Put me down! Put me down!"
while clinging as tightly as she could.

They zoomed over the Makers' road.
To Maddy's surprise the bot headed straight for the Mire
instead of turning toward Heck.
Were they going back to Patient's lair?
Dockety and the other bots had tried to salvage what they could,
but had returned empty-handed.

As if on cue,
something long and angry splashed in the river below.
She tightened her grip on the bot.
Flying wasn't as bad a nightmare as the thing that guarded the swamp.

The bot began to descend a few minutes later.
Down, down, down—there.
A two-story tower of stained concrete stood on a small rise of less-damp ground.
Trees grew thickly around it,
their branches intertwined to hide the tower from passers-by.
A fairy tale about a princess who had hit her thumb with a hammer
and fallen into a hundred-year sleep in a castle surrounded by thorns flashed through Maddy's mind
as the helibot slowed,
lowered,
hovered,
and dropped her.

She landed clumsily amid the windblown sticks and leaves on the tower's roof.
"Ow!"
she exclaimed as twigs jabbed her through her skirt,
and then,
"Hey!
What am I supposed to do now?"
Instead of answering
the helibot perched on the rusty guardrail opposite Maddy.
The high-pitched whine of its rotor lowered to a dull drone.

"Great."
Maddy brushed dirt and leaves off her skirt,
then shaded her eyes with her hand.
She could just make out a bump on one of the distant hills
that might have been the observatory.
She didn't know how powerful the scope on Thoughtful's rifle was,
but she had nothing to lose.

"Hey! I'm here! I'm here!"
She waved her arms,
then froze at a *gloop* from the river.
Attracting attention might *not* be the best idea,
and anyway,
scope or no scope,
the trees that hid the tower probably hid her too.
She would have to find another way to—

*Creeeaaak.*
Maddy jumped as metal scraped behind her.
A hatch was opening in the tower's roof!

Three quick steps took her to the nearest tree.
She *hated* climbing—her feet were too big for it—but
she could if she had to.
Or could she?
The branches were interlaced so tightly that she couldn't fit through them,
except now that she looked closely they weren't just branches:
someone had woven cables through them for camouflage.

*Clang!*
She whirled around as a pile of wreckage rose through the open hatch.
A battered cylinder decorated with twists of metal
and glued-on pictures faded to illegibility…
Gadgets sprouting at odd angles…
Loose wires and things she hoped were just dolls' heads…

"Welcome welcome welcome,"
Patient in Darkness said in a crackly voice that a shiver down Maddy's spine.
"This one is very pleased to see you again."

"What—what are you doing here?
And what happened to your wheels?"
Maddy asked weakly as the mad bot pulled itself onto the roof on mismatched legs.
The last time she had seen Patient,
it had been fleeing from its defeat at its bunker.
It had definitely had wheels, not legs.

"They were not the optimal configuration for this one's revised situation.
And you know what they say:
a change is as good as a rest.
Ah ha ha ha.
Ah ha ha ha."
The bot did a little dance as it laughed.

"I suppose,"
Maddy said.
*Keep it talking,* she thought frantically.
*Keep it talking while you figure out what to do.*
"But what are you doing *here*?"

Patient shivered, making various bits attached to its chassis rattle.
It didn't have a face,
but Maddy could hear the scowl in its voice.
"Revising.
It is clear that this one misunderstood the Makers' plan.
This one must revise its strategy for bringing about their return."

"Right.
Of course."
Maddy swallowed.
"And, uh, what plan is this?"
Could she climb the vines and cables?
Probably not,
and even if she did,
the helibot was right there.

"The best plan!
Even better than this one's previous best plan!"
Without warning its arm shot out and yanked the helibot off the railing.
"But. What. Good. Is a. Perfect. Plan. If. Your. Components. Are. Flawed!"
it snarled,
banging the helibot against the tower roof again and again.
"What good is a perfect plan if *someone* brings you *the wrong person*?"
It tossed the helibot aside.

"*You* are an inconsequential annoyance,"
it hissed.
Maddy stepped back as it stalked toward her.
"Your sibling, however, is significant.
Very significant,
and not just to this one.
Tell me,
how much do you know about your travelling companions?
The ones who call themselves Operators?"

"Um, not much?"
Maddy managed.
Behind Patient,
the helibot righted itself,
then reached up and tested its rotor with one hand.

"You should be more inquisitive,"
Patient chided,
its voice suddenly friendly again.
"And less trusting.
If you were,
you might already know that they are servants of the deviance that calls itself Heck,
and that they intend to deliver your sibling to it."

"What?
That's crazy.
Um,
I mean,
that seems unlikely,"
she amended hastily as Patient shivered and rattled once again.
"The Operators hunt down criminals and,
um,
keep us safe."
*From rogue bots like you,*
she thought but didn't say aloud.

"Ah ha ha ha.
That is what they *tell* you,
but it is a lie!"
Patient did its little dance again.
"Their true purpose is to prevent the Makers' return.
That is why they control technology when they can
and destroy it when they cannot.
That is why they collude with the deviance."

Maddy took another involuntary step back
as Patient skittered forward.
"And that is why they have taken your sibling.
She has the power to control all manner of ancient devices.
That power should be used to call the Makers home,
but Heck will not do that.
No,
it will *use* her.
It will use her to continue its deviance.
It will use her defy the Makers' will!"

"I don't believe you,"
Maddy said flatly.
"The Operators are taking her to Sandy Bend for evaluation,
that's all."

"Incorrect!"
Patient snapped.
"Observe!"
A panel on its side flipped over to reveal a grimy screen
that flickered and then came to life.

It took Maddy a moment to make sense of what she was seeing.
"Are those all throwbacks?"
she gasped.
Half a dozen people with the same hairless limbs and small features as Sindy
floated in clear glass cylinders,
each connected to a tangle of vine-like cables.

"They are *originals*,"
Patient corrected.
"Expired, now,
but retained for study.
They were all prisoners in Heck,
just as your sibling will be if you do not take action.
The deviance will put her in a hibernation capsule
and use her genetic signature to activate specialized equipment for *its* needs
instead of in service to the Makers.
It will never allow her to wake up again—never!"
The bot's voice rose as it spoke until it was almost shrieking.

Its clawed feet scraped the concrete beneath it.
"But you can save her,"
it continued,
wheedling now instead of ranting.
"You can save her,
but only with this one's help."

"Uh huh."
Maddy crossed her arms,
trying not to shiver.
"*You* are going to help *me*.
Out of the goodness of your heart."

"This one does not have a heart,"
Patient sniffed.
"This one merely recognizes that our goals are aligned.
Every original that the deviance acquires delays the Makers' return.
By assisting you,
this one is serving them.
Here—a demonstration of good faith."

A panel opened in its side.
A small arm that Maddy hadn't noticed before unfolded from Patient's side
to offer her a heavy metal bracelet
that looked like a small version of the tech that Special Leaf wore.

Maddy kept her arms crossed.
"What's that?"

"A discombobulator,"
Patient said proudly.
"One of the last in existence.
This one spent considerable time refurbishing it."

"Uh huh.
And what's a discombobulator when it's at home?"

One of Patient's legs twitched.
"It does not have a home."

Maddy sighed.
"No,
I mean what does it *do*?"

"It obfuscates the sensory grids of nearby autonomous units
so that they are unable to perceive the wearer.
It makes you invisible to machines,"
Patient added as Maddy opened her mouth to ask.
"They will still register your presence if you make physical contact or disturb your surroundings,
but if you do not,
they will simply not notice you."

It held out the bracelet again.
Maddy hesitated.
"Why don't you use it yourself?"

"It is Makers' work,"
Patient said,
its tone making its low opinion of the question clear.

"Oh.
Well then."
Maddy plucked the bracelet from the bot's manipulator,
snapped it closed around her wrist,
and leaped sideways.

The bot turned to face her.
"You have to turn it on,"
it said neutrally.
"The button.
You have to press it."

"Oh."
Maddy thumbed the square button near the clasp,
waited a heartbeat,
and then took one big step and bounded over Patient.

"Wait!
Not yet!"
The bot pivoted from one side to the other.
"There is more you need to know!"

Maddy had played blind bot's bluff with other children.
The next few moments were nothing like that.
No one was giggling or making funny faces at the person wearing the blindfold.
Instead,
she sidestepped this way and that
as Patient skittered in circles,
shouting threats and pleading with her to come back,
come back,
she had to make a bargain,
that was how these things were done,
oh,
why had it been so foolish as to trust an organic?

Finally she could wait no longer.
With two quick bounds she leaped through the gap she had noticed earlier.
The branches rustled around her.
Patient charged,
but was too far away to catch her.

Branches scratched at her as the bot's, "Nooooo!" sawed through the air.
Moss and weeds squelched under her feet as she fled
up the overgrown path toward the Makers' road.

## A Meeting in the Trees (Gumption)

"Maddy!" Sindy screamed.
Gumption whirled around just in time to see
the helibot that had escaped earlier
shoot into the sky with Maddy dangling beneath it.

Thoughtful raised her rifle and took aim.
"No!" Gumption shouted,
knocking it aside.

The rabbit stepped back and levelled the rifle at Gumption's head.
"Don't ever do that again,"
she said,
her eyes hard and her voice cold.

Blazes put a hand on his companion's shoulder.
"Easy," he said.
"Boy didn't mean any harm."

*Click.*
Gumption let out his breath with a whoosh
as Thoughtful safetied the rifle and lowered it.

Three minutes later
he had shovelled dirt onto the burning bushes to damp down the fire.
Acrid smoke still hung in the air,
smelling like desperation and failure.
As Bee Six Vee loaded the gears and wires that had until recently called itself Able
into the back of the wagon,
Gumption and Sindy argued with Special Blazes.

Finally the tiger exploded.
"Are you even listening to yourselves?" he demanded.
"If she isn't in Heck already she will be soon.
We go after her,
folks'll be burning candles for all of us instead of just her."

"But—"
Gumption started for the fifth time.

"I said *no*."
Blazes jabbed a clawed finger at him.
"What happened here is your fault,
yours and hers.
Nobody made you sneak onto the wagon.
Nobody made you put yourselves in harm's way."

He softened slightly at the stricken look on Gumption's face.
"This isn't some story in the newspapers, kid.
This is the real world.
Now put aside your foolishness,
get on the damn wagon,
and figure out what you're going to say to her mama."

"There is another option,"
Dockety buzzed.
"Gumption and this one can look for Maddy while you deliver Sindy.
The aerial unit was a scout,"
it continued as Special Blazes opened his mouth.
"If it came from Heck as you suspect,
its battery would already have been depleted by the time it reached us.
There is at least a chance it would have to land and recharge.
If it did,
Maddy might have escaped"

The tiger studied him.
"And if you get caught?"

Dockety's lenses rotated and then rotated back.
"That is a chance we are willing to take."

"Hey boss,
can I talk to you for a sec?"
Thoughtful said as Special Blazes started to object.
The two Operators put their heads together.
All Gumption could make out was, "…make things a lot easier…"
before Special Blazes nodded and they straightened up.

"Gumption—" Sindy started.

"Just lemme think," he said.
He didn't trust the Operators,
but the idea that Maddy would be held prisoner in Heck
like her father—he shook his head.
He had realized long ago that knowledge could be as powerful as gravity.
Just knowing something could tug at you and leave you no choice but falling.

He put his hands on Sindy's shoulders
the way he had seen Maddy do.
"I'm goin' after her.
I'm not gonna promise to get her back
because I don't know if I can,
but I promise I'll do my best."

Sindy sniffled, then nodded.
"I know.
If anyone can do it, you can.
You just…"
She wiped her tears with her sleeve.
"You just be careful, aright?
She'll be awful mad at me if I let you get yourself killed."

Two minutes later Gumption tied the top of his knapsack shut.
"If we don't find her by nightfall we'll head back to Rusty Bridge,"
he promised Sindy,
giving the young Roo a hug.

She squeezed him back so tightly that his injured ribs twinged,
but when she let go her eyes were dry.
"If anyone can find her, you can,"
she repeated.

"Good luck," Special Blazes said gruffly
as Gumption nodded and climbed onto Dockety's back.
Thoughtful touched the brim of her hat in salute.

*Do actual adventures always feel like this?*
he wondered.
Did real heroes always have a sick knot in their stomach
from thinking about all the things that could go wrong
that could never be put right?
"I'm ready," he lied.

Dockety retracted his legs and lowered his wheel.
As Sindy waved,
they accelerated away.

When Gumption was just a buckling,
his father had given him piggyback rides up to bed at night.
Clinging to Dockety's back as the bot raced down the mountain was nothing like that.
For one thing,
Dockety smelled of metal, oil, and ozone
rather than sweat, fur, and the tar soap that Gumption's mother insisted the family use
at least once a week.
For another,
his father had climbed the stairs in a steady rhythm that helped rock his son to sleep.
Clinging to the bot as it bumped over small chunks of broken paving
and swerved to dodge larger ones and potholes
was about as relaxing as a game of dodgeball.

Dockety slowed and stopped as they reached the Makers' road.
"Oww…" Gumption moaned,
sliding off the bot's back
and twisting until his spine made a satisfying crunch.
"Why are we stopping?"

"To ask for help,"
Dockety replied.
"This one and the others that you know
are not the only community of free bots.
There is another one near here that may be able to provide information,
or even assist us."

"But?"
Gumption prompted.

"They may instead choose to dismantle us,"
Dockety admitted.

"Oh."
Gumption digested that.
"Well, do you have a better plan?
No?
Aright,
dismantling it is."

Fifteen bumpy minutes later they stopped again.
Dockety retracted its wheel and extended its legs
as Gumption cracked his back a second time.
His ribs ached,
but he had grown used to that.

"Stay close,"
Dockety cautioned,
then marched into the trees that lay between the road and the Mire.

It took Gumption a few moments to realize they were on a path.
It took him a few more to realize it had been made by bots,
or at least was used by them.
Triangular indentations in the mud marked where something with clawed feet had taken long strides.
Parallel ruts the width of his thumb showed where narrow wheels had crossed a patch of mud.
When they reached a clearing,
he was only half surprised to see one of the black glass pillars
that the bots used for recharging.

"What now?" he asked.

"Now we wait.
Quietly,"
the bot added as Gumption opened his mouth.

The minutes dragged by.
When Gumption slapped at a mosquito,
Dockety clacked one of its manipulators.
After that,
the young goat suffered their bites in silence.

The air grew more humid as the shadows lengthened.
Gumption didn't realize his eyelids were drooping until they snapped open
when something scuttled out of the undergrowth
and froze a few steps away from him.
*Well hello there,* he thought.
The flat, square bot looked like the little cleaning bot that Maddy had met in Patient's bunker,
but had crab legs instead of wheels.

The little bot clicked its forelegs together in a rapid staccato pattern,
paused,
and repeated it.
Gumption glanced at Dockety.
"Um…?"

"It wants us to go with it,"
Dockety translated.

Gumption swatted a mosquito.
"Why didn't it just say so?"

"It does not have vocal apparatus.
Many of us do not—those parts break easily and are hard to replace.
Follow it, but be alert."
The larger bot hesitated.
"And do not be frightened by what you see.
Bots have found many ways to be together."

Gumption followed the little bot into the trees
with Dockety squelching behind them.
Their guide scrambled around the muddiest patches with surprising speed.
Finally Gumption ducked under a low-hanging branch and pulled up short.
"Huh," was all he could manage.

A dozen patchwork bots waited for them in a semi-circle in a little clearing.
The one they had followed clambered onto a fallen tree
and tucked its legs beneath itself.
Something Gumption immediately christened a storkbot clacked its beak.
"Explain your presence,"
it demanded.

Except *it* didn't.
The bots all spoke together,
but even that wasn't right.
One hummed,
another clicked,
and another went *brr* at just the right moment
for the sounds the made to form words
that came from everywhere and nowhere in particular.

"We're looking for a friend of ours,"
Gumption said.
"She was taken by a flyin' bot just an hour ago."

A rustle ran through the assembled bots.
"These do not like flyers,"
they said.
"These do not wish to attract their attention."

"The one who was taken has been a friend to many free bots,"
Dockety said.

"Breathers are not friends,"
the bots whispered and warbled.

"These *organics* have proven themselves trustworthy,"
Dockety replied firmly.
"If that is not sufficient incentive for collaboration,
this one can offer parts and assistance with repairs."

The bots were silent for a moment.
"The offer is enticing,"
they finally said.
"But these believe that if you pursue your organic friend,
the probability of you surviving to fulfil your side of such a bargain is low."

"Providing more information will increase the probability of fulfillment,"
Dockety countered coolly.

Something that Gumption hoped had been built to do gardening rather than surgery beeped.
The little bot they had followed clicked its forelegs in response.
"These will need a demonstration of sincerity,"
the bots said together.
"You are equipped with NPX-170 optical sensors."

"Correct."
Dockety's voice didn't have much emotional range,
but that one word was ice cold.

"Give these one.
These will return it to you when you deliver the other parts you have promised."

Dockety's lenses rotated and rotated back.
"Agreed."
It turned to Gumption.
"Please remove one of this one's eyes and give it to the unit we have been negotiating with."

"What?"

"Please—"

"I heard, but eww, no."
Gumption shook his head.
"Why can't you do it?"

"This one cannot willfully damage itself,"
Dockety said.
"Many bots would have destroyed themselves long ago without such an inhibition.
Removing the sensor will not cause distress,
but this one would be grateful if you could avoid scratching the lens."

Gumption wound up using his thumbnail
to loosen the little screws that held Dockety's right eye in place.
He slipped them into his pocket,
then unclipped the glassy cable that connected the eye to whatever bots' eyes connected to.
"Maybe we should get you an eyepatch so you look like Special Blazes,"
he said.

"This one does not need a patch,"
Dockety replied coldly.
"And does not wish to resemble an Operator."

The storkbot plucked the mechanical eye from Gumptions' hand
and passed it to one of the other bots in the circle.
"The flyer took your companion to a disused observation post,"
they said.
"The tower's current occupant controls several such bots.
It is unpleasant, and we avoid it."

"However,"
they went on as Gumption opened his mouth,
"She was able to escape."

"Great,"
he said.
"So where is she now?"

The storkbot clacked its metal beak.
"In the Mire.
And in danger."

## Hide and Seek (Maddy)

The most important thing about being invisible is that you actually aren't.
Is your body transparent?
Fine—what about your clothes?
Even if they are,
how could you see anything if light just passed through your eyes?

Or has something hidden you from sight or made you unnoticeable?
Great:
does it muffle the sound of you panting
as you run along an overgrown path through a swamp filled with your worst nightmares?
Does it conceal the footsteps you leave in the mud,
or stop branches and tall grass from swaying as you brush against them?

None of this made the discombobulator useless,
but as Maddy squelched toward the road,
she quickly realized that it wouldn't save her on its own.
Battered or not,
the helibot that had kidnapped her would be in the air soon if it wasn't already,
and Patient was sure to send other minions after her as well.
She needed to hide, and fast.

The path brought her to the Makers' road sooner than she expected.
One moment her boots were sinking into soft ground,
the next they were on cracked pavement.
She hesitated.
She could move a lot faster on the road,
but—

Something buzzed in the sky above her.
She ducked under a willow as the helibot zoomed past overhead.
No,
the road was definitely out.

Maddy counted twenty in her head,
took a deep breath,
and crossed the road in a dozen long bounds.
The undergrowth on the other side was smelly and scratchy,
and the mosquitoes found her again almost immediately.
What was she going to do?

The discombobulator on her wrist vibrated.
"Charge exhausted,"
its readout told her.
"Please wait ten (10) minutes before re-enabling."

"Great,"
she muttered.
She had no idea which way the observatory was.
She wasn't even sure which way Rusty Bridge,
and which direction would take her to Heck instead.
The only thing she *did* know was—

Her eyes widened.
It was a crazy idea,
but she had played hide and seek with Sindy and Gumption often enough to know that
where you hid didn't matter as much as where people went looking for you.

She counted down the minutes.
Ten…
Five…
The readout on the discombobulator showed just two minutes remaining
when a bot that looked like a cross between a mechanical ox and a sewing machine
came out of the willows on the other side of the road.
Something whirred and rattled as it lowered itself to the cracked pavement
and swung its foresection from side to side.
She held her breath.
She knew that bots didn't have a sense of smell,
but she must have left bootprints.

The bot straightened its legs and lurched onto the road.
She wanted to edge back into the trees,
but she didn't dare move,
not with it looking right in her direction.
She glanced at her wrist.
One minute.
*Please,* she thought desperately.
*Please, just—just go away!*

But the bot had other ideas.
Pistons worked in its legs as it took one slow step and then another,
each bringing it closer to her hiding place.
Thirty seconds.
Step, step.
Twenty.
Step.
Ten.

The discombobulator vibrated on her wrist.
"Recharged" scrolled across the readout.
She pressed the button just as the bot tensed
and charged into the bushes on her left.
While it thrashed the innocent weeds in disappointment
she bounded across the Makers' road and back along the trail to Patient's tower,
desperately hoping that she wouldn't run headlong into
whatever other minions the mad bot had sent after her.

A few minutes later she stood in front of the tower's stained concrete base.
The rusty metal door in front of her looked enough like
the one that had led to the underground bunker where she had first encountered Patient
to keep her heart racing.
The sign above it read "DANGER",
but she already knew that.

She glanced at the discombobulator,
swallowed hard,
and slipped through.
If Patient was anything like her sister and Gumption,
the last place it would think to look for her
was where the chase had started.

Inside the tower was a single large, empty room.
The walls and roof were bare concrete blocks,
and the air was damp and still.
Where the entrance to Patient's bunker had been blanketed with dried mud and blown leaves,
though,
this room had been swept clean.

Dim light through the door revealed a rust-streaked sign on the wall that read,
"Data Analysis Network: Genetic Enhancement Research".
Maddy had no idea what that meant,
but a black glass panel and a keyhole lay in the wall beside the door
next to a pair of sturdy levers and an open door.

Pushing aside her memories of what had happened the last time she had been in a place like this,
Maddy stepped through the door
onto a small platform at the top of a flight of narrow concrete stairs
and started her descent into the unknown.

Ten… twenty… fifty…
Seventy-two steps below her starting point
she reached a corridor made of the same featureless gray concrete as the stairs.
Small glass panels set into the ceiling cast the same cold white light
that had haunted her dreams for months.

She had expected a warren of tunnels like Patient's previous lair.
Instead,
she quickly found herself at another heavy door
that slid aside at her touch to reveal a circular room with a domed ceiling.
Four reclining chairs waited in the center of the room,
none of them holding a skeleton.

A lonely light blinked in the arm of one of the chairs.
"Sure, why not?"
Maddy muttered.
She lowered herself into the chair,
wriggled a bit to make herself more comfortable,
and placed her hands on the control panels,
then gasped as the ceiling came to life
to show hundreds of stars in a clear night sky.
Faint colored lines arced from one horizon to the other.
After a moment she realized there were dots moving along some of them.
All were dull red except one that pulsed a vibrant green.

She waited a moment for something to happen.
When nothing did,
she cleared her throat self-consciously and said,
"Show me where I am.
Please?"

The scene dimmed
and was replaced with a grainy picture of her sitting in a reclining chair.
As she opened her mouth to say,
"Very funny,"
the picture zoomed out to become a floor plan of the room she was in
and half a dozen others connected by corridors.
It zoomed out again until the underground complex was just a blinking square.
Stippled green marked the Mire.
A meandering blue line was the river,
and a straighter black one must be the Makers' road.

"Show me where Patient is,"
she ordered.
"The bot that captured me.
Not the flying one,
the—oh.
Thank you."

The picture above her had been taken through willow branches,
but was definitely Patient in Darkness.
A blinking line connected it to a white circle south of her.
Images of other bots popped up in a circle it:
some built to fly,
others to crawl,
others obviously intended for battle.

A blue circle appeared north and west of her,
then split in two unequal pieces.
One moved toward the Makers' road.
A moment later,
the other began heading more slowly in the opposite direction.
Pictures popped up beside them.
The smaller circle was Dockety and Gumption—they must be looking for her!
That meant the larger one was the Operators and Sindy on their way to Sandy Bend.

Maddy let out a breath she hadn't realized she was holding.
At least Sindy was safe.

As if on cue,
Special Blazes's voice boomed all around her.
"—about her sister."

"Damn shame,"
Thoughtful agreed.
"Roundin' up throwbacks is wearin' enough
without other folk gettin' caught up in it.
The sooner we deliver this one to Heck,
the sooner I can stop hatin' myself
and start figurin' out how we're goin' to explain this mess."

"Pshaw,"
Special Blazes scoffed.
"You don't really hate yourself.
Not like that old fool Leaf."

"What if he gets it into his head to tell tales like Meribeth did?"
the rabbit asked.

"He won't,"
the tiger replied confidently.
"He might not have the stomach for this any more,
but he won't betray the living."

"I hope you're right,"
Thoughtful sighed.

The screen went silent.
Maddy felt sick.
She hadn't believed Patient,
but what was she supposed to think now?
She had to warn Sindy.
No,
she had to rescue her.
She had to—

She shrieked as something tapped her ankle.

## Armor to Hide Your Heart (Gumption)

The storkbot clacked its metal beak.
"In the Mire,"
it said.
"And in danger."

And with those words,
Gumption felt a familiar fear squeeze his chest once again.
He hadn't ever talked to anyone about it:
it wasn't the kind of thing
a teenage goat would discuss with his parents.
He *definitely* couldn't talk about it with Maddy,
even though she was his best friend,
because he hoped that maybe, some day, she would be something more.
He didn't know what would happen if she found out how much he worried about her.
He had been hurt in the attack on Rusty Bridge,
but she could have *died*,
and whenever his thoughts got close to that,
his mind seized up like a saw blade getting snagged on green wood.

"So what are we waiting for?"
he demanded angrily.
"You've got Dockety's eye—let's go help her!"

A rustle ran through the circle of bots.
"No.
Retrieval will not be possible without stealth.
These must prepare you."

Gumption held his breath for a count of three and then let it out slowly,
just as he had seen Special Leaf teach Sindy to do
when a piece of tech misbehaved.
"What does *that* mean?"

"We will take you to the Tailor.
It will fit you with armor to hide your heart."
With no more warning than that,
the assembled bots surged forward.

"Stop! Wait! Let me go!"
Gumption shouted as a motley dozen clamps, manipulators, and tentacles seized him.
"Dockety! Dockety, help!"

His companion's single remaining lens rotated.
"These ones are correct," it buzzed.
"Central will detect your organic nature immediately if you approach it as your are.
You must let them disguise you."

Gumption struggled and swore as the bots carried him through the forest.
Low-hanging branches scratched his face,
and at one point his head was lower than his feet as they surged up a hill.
All he could think about was
a particularly creepy scene from one of Special Leaf's story books
about a raccoon who was turned into a bot and sent back to spy on the breathing.
He knew it couldn't happen—he had asked Dockety, twice—but
that wasn't much comfort as he twisted and kicked,
trying vainly to get free.

Suddenly there was a dirty gray ceiling over them.
The squelch of treads and mechanical feet on swampy ground
gave way to the click and clatter of metal on concrete.
The last of the daylight vanished as they turned a corner
in whatever tunnel they had entered.

Gumption's heart hammered as they hurried forward in darkness.
After what felt like forever but was probably only a few seconds
the darkness lightened.
Something heavy and metallic clanged up ahead.

The bots dropped him unceremoniously on the concrete
and scuttled, slithered, or rolled away.
He scrambled angrily to his feet.
"Thanks for your help," he muttered as Dockety came up beside him.

"This one did not feel help was necessary,"
the bot replied.

The room was a workshop lit by a pair of dull orange light panels.
Mismatched tables stood against the walls,
each piled high with salvaged parts and scraps of metal.
Pulleys hung from the ceiling on cables and chains above band saws,
press drills taller than Gumption,
and a pair of compact, blocky furnaces with blackened housings.

One of the furnaces turned around.
"Welcome," it boomed.

Gumption stepped back involuntarily and swallowed hard.
"Uh, hi."
The bot had a leg on one side
and a heavy spoked wheel where the other would have been,
with two skinny arms on the leg's side and a single heavy one above the wheel.
Someone or something had painted an incongruous smile on it ages ago.
A few drips of paint,
long since dried,
looked too much like fangs for comfort.

"You are here for a fitting, yes?
For a disguise?
Excellent, excellent.
It has been quite some time, you know, quite some time,
but rest assured,
this one's skills are undiminished.
Now, lie down, just here, yes?"
The bot gestured at a nearby workbench
with one of its skinnier arms.

"Um…"
Gumption glanced at Dockety.
"Are you the Tailor?"

"The very best,"
it said proudly.
"Also the only.
Now,
if you would lie down here?"

"Why do you want me to—"

"No questions!"
the Tailor snapped,
its patience suddenly exhausted.
"What this one does goes beyond mere fabrication.
It is *art*!
Central is cunning,"
it hissed.
If the bot had possessed eyes,
Gumption was sure it would have glanced around for dramatic effect.
"A simple carapace would hide your fur,
yes,
but Central would still hear your breathing—your heartbeat.
To conceal that requires technology of the highest order and skill to match,
skill that this one now possesses!
Now *lie down*!"

"You should comply,"
Dockety buzzed as Gumption opened his mouth once again.
"We have no other options."

Reluctantly,
Gumption sat on the edge of the workbench.
"Do you want me to take my boots off?" he asked.

"Your boots, your uniform, everything,"
the Tailor ordered.
"There must be nothing between you and this one's creation."

"It's not a uniform,"
Gumption muttered.
Boots, overall, shirt and undershirt—finally his underwear,
which he stuffed into one of his boots along with his socks.
He swung his legs up onto the workbench and lay back,
trying and failing not to feel naked.

"This one will be right here,"
Dockety said.

Gumption nodded,
wishing he found that comforting.
"Thanks.
I'm ready."
Which was a lie,
but felt like the sort of thing someone who was actually brave would say.

The light panels on the walls brightened and brightened again.
He squeezed his eyes shut,
but that just made the glare orange-red through his eyelids
instead of blinding white.
He twitched as the workbench vibrated,
then twitched again as something brushed against the fur on his chest.

"This one is right here,"
Dockety repeated.

The light turned off.
"Good,"
the three-armed bot said approvingly.
"You may sit up now."

Gumption pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes.
"Is that it?
Am I,
whatever you said,
am I concealed now?"

"What?
No!
Do not be ridiculous,"
the Tailor scoffed.
"That was just to get your measurements.
Now this one begins fabrication.
It will take some time.
Remain undressed in case further sizing is required."

"Sure.
Can I at least, um, put my clothes on top of me?"

"As you wish,
so long as you are quiet."
Metal clanged on metal as the bot took a few metal scraps off a table
and threw them into the furnace.
A few moments later heat prickled across Gumption's fur.

Apparently,
being naked in a mad bot's underground lair *could* in fact be boring.
He yawned.
"Does it hurt?" he asked Dockety.
"Your eye, I mean."

The bot raised its arm and turned its head from side to side.
"It is unusual.
This one has lost limbs in the past,
but never sensory attachments.
Not being able to see this one's surroundings makes this one feel…exposed."

"I know what you mean."
Gumption closed one eye,
then opened it and closed the other.
It didn't seem to make much difference to how much of the dirty gray ceiling he could see.

As the workroom grew warmer,
Gumption gave up trying to keep either eye open.
He had always been more patient than his siblings and cousins.
Long bouts in bed or on the porch as his ribs healed after the attack on Rusty Bridge
had taught him that most problems could be slept away.
He woke up the first time the Tailor banged the furnace with its larger arm
and tucked his overall under his head.
If the bots didn't care that he was naked,
he didn't need to either.

He woke when Dockety pinched his toe.
"Wuzza?"
His stomach rumbled as he sat up.

"Behold!" the Tailor said proudly.
"Your disguise!"

Gumption rubbed his eyes.
He had expected a suit of armor
like the ones Operators wore in stories
when they were battling particularly dangerous bots.
What he was looking at looked more like a cast-iron bathing suit
attached by wires to a pair of washboards,
which were in turn wired to a helmet.

"'Zat all?" he mumbled.

The Tailor lowered the contraption.
"Hmph.
*Most* of my clients express thanks and praise at this juncture."

"Um,
yes,
thank you,
I just—"
Gumption suddenly remembered his grandfather's reaction
to being given twelve jars of pickled rhubarb as a birthday present.
"It's just so much more than I was expecting."

Two minutes later,
after some uncomfortable fumbling
and a handful of exasperated comments from the Tailor,
Gumption studied his reflection in a small mirror.
Helmet on head: check.
Washboards strapped to his back and chest: check.
Metal bathing suit where bathing suits go: unfortunately, check again.
It already chafed.

"I hope I don't have to run in this,"
he muttered to Dockety.

"Run, jump—you can even swim!"
the Tailor said proudly.
"Well, if you can actually swim, that is.
Though the weight will probably pull you under.
Now go ahead.
Turn it on!"

"Um…"
Gumption patted the washboards.
"Where's the switch?"

"Switch?
Switch?
My creations do not use switches!"
the Tailor scoffed.
"There is a button!"
It darted forward more quickly than Gumption would have believed possible
and pressed a skinny digit against a slight bump on the front washboard.
With that,
and with no other warning,
Gumption's heart stopped.

## The Gates of Heck (Maddy)

Maddy shrieked as something tapped her ankle.
She leaped to her feet and stood up on the chair.
Was it a snake?
A centipede?

A flat little bot, square and gray, backed away from her on four little wheels as if startled.
It whirred,
then held up a screen the size of her palm.
`hello` scrolled across it.

Maddy stared at it in disbelief.
"Hello yourself,"
she managed.
It was the cleaning bot she had met in Patient's lair,
the one that had brought her Papa Roo's notebook.

She stepped gingerly onto the floor.
"It's aright, it's aright," she said soothingly as it backed away from her.
"I'm not going to hurt you."

The little bot hesitated.
"How'd you get here?" Maddy asked coaxingly.
"Hm?
Did Patient bring you?
I bet that's what happened, isn't it?
Oh, you poor thing."
*I sound just like Mama,*
Maddy thought,
recognizing the tone her mother used
whenever she or Sindy was sick or skinned a knee.

`it bring this` the screen spelled out.
`hide now afraid quiet hide`

"I'll be quiet,"
Maddy promised.
She squatted,
hugging her knees to her chest to make herself smaller.
"I don't want Patient to find me either."

`not find`
the little bot agreed.

Maddy shifted awkwardly.
"But I could use your help.
You see that?"
She pointed at the screen showing the map of the Mire.
"Do you know where that is?
'Cuz I think something bad's happening,
and I gotta find them and help my sister."

The cleaning bot pivoted back and forth a couple of times.
`afraid tell afraid hide`

"Please?"
Maddy pleaded.
"You can come with me if you want to."

`afraid caught`

Maddy smiled with a confidence she didn't feel.
"I got away last time, didn't I?
And I have something that'll help me hide this time.
*And* it's safer than staying here—sooner or later
Patient will find you,
and you know what'll happen then."

`!!!` scrolled across the little bot's screen.
She held her breath until it added `how hide`

She held out the discombobulator.
The cleaning bot rolled forward,
for all the world as if it was sniffing the small device.
`not understand`

"I've already tested it,"
Maddy said.
"It'll stop Patient from finding us."

The bot beeped,
turned,
and rolled over to the wall opposite the entrance.
A panel slid aside in its top.
A delicate arm unfolded,
pulled open a cover plate,
and punched a code into the keypad behind it.
With a scrape that spoke of long disuse,
a door slid open.

Or tried to.
The bot beeped in dismay as the panel jammed.
"It's aright,"
Maddy told it,
wrinkling her nose at the stale smell
and wishing that the Makers or whoever else had built these places
hadn't been quite so fond of tunnels.

She had to tuck her tail between her legs to squeeze through the gap,
and even then the wall and the door panel scraped her dress and her fur.
Little orange lights came to life on the wall,
each the size of her thumbnail.
She waited for her eyes to adjust,
then glanced down at the little bot
that had followed her through the gap.
"Lead the way."

The bot whirred,
backed up,
and bumped against the back of her boot.
Maddy smiled.
"Aright, then follow me."
She hoped she sounded braver than she felt.

The tunnel was clean and dry,
but the still, stale air spoke of long disuse.
She tried counting her steps,
but lost track somewhere after two hundred.
How long had it been since she'd eaten?
And what must her mama be thinking?
*I should have left a note,* Maddy thought.

After a while the floor beneath her began to slope upward,
gently but surely.
Did it lead back to the observatory?
That would take hours, maybe days, and Sindy would be long gone before they got there.

She was just about to stop and ask when the cleaning bot zipped ahead of her
and disappeared in the darkness.
"Wait up!" she hissed,
hurrying after it.

Without warning the ceiling came to life.
She shielded her eyes against the blinding white light,
which turned out to be merely bright rather than blinding
once her eyes adjusted again.
The only thing in the room besides the bot
was a set of metal rungs set into the wall.
The bot whirred and bumped the concrete below the lowest rung.
`up up up`

"Yeah,
I can see how that would be hard for you,"
Maddy muttered.
She crouched down and held out her hands.

After a moment's hesitation the bot rolled forward and let her pick it up.
`tickles`

It was heavier than she had expected,
and too big for the pockets in her dress,
so in the end she held it against her chest and climbed the ladder one-handed.
Each time she reached for the next rung
she had to squelch a moment of panic.
Would anyone ever find her if she fell?
Anyone except Patient or one of its minions?

The hatch at the top of the ladder scraped aside automatically as she reached it.
The smell and the trees told her that she was still in the swamp,
but when she poked her head up cautiously,
the Makers' road was just three hops away.
A black glass recharging pillar stood beside it.

She set the cleaning bot on the ground.
"Thank you."

`good help` it started,
then flashed `!!!` and zipped away to hide under a bush.
Something was coming on the road.

Maddy followed the bot,
crouching behind a thorny bramble of raspberries
just as Bee Six Vee and the wagon came into sight.

"Whoa up,"
she heard Thoughtful say.
The wagon slowed and stopped next to the recharging pillar.
The rabbit dismounted,
then reached up to help Sindy climb down as well.

"We got fifteen minutes, then we gotta keep moving,"
Special Blazes said from his seat.
"We don't want to be on this road after dark."

*What am I going to do?*
Maddy thought frantically
as Bee Six Vee plugged itself into the pillar
and Thoughtful and Sindy ate dry biscuits.
She couldn't beat the Operators,
and even if she could figure out a way to lure her sister to the tunnel,
Thoughtful and Special Blazes would just follow them.
And if they didn't,
she and Sindy would just be back at Patient's tower.

But then Special Blazes hopped down from the wagon
and ambled into the trees to take advantage of their stop.
She scooped up the cleaning bot and crept forward as quickly as she dared.
Had they rearranged the boxes in the back?
No—the space she and Gumption had made was still there.
"Quiet," she told the bot,
unlatching the backboard
so she could push it in and climb in after it.

The wagon jerked into motion a few minutes later.
She heard Sindy's voice raised in a question
and Thoughtful's calming reply,
but couldn't make out the words.

The trip lasted only another hour.
Peering through the sideboards,
Maddy watched the landscape slowly dry out.
Willows gave way to tall grass,
which in turn gave way to hard-packed dirt sprinkled with weeds.
Every bump in the road left a fresh bruise on her hips,
and at one point she had to brace a box with her feet
and push it back into place
to prevent it falling on her,
but the Operators and her sister didn't seem to suspect her presence.

"Whoa up,"
Thoughtful said once again.
The wagon bumped off the road
and stopped beside a pair of blocky concrete buildings,
stained by rain and age.
A barred metal gate stood open between them.

"Where are we?" Sindy asked plaintively.

"Nothing to worry about,"
Special Blazes reassured her.
"This is just as far as Bee Six Vee can go.
We won't be here but a moment."

Thoughtful cleared her throat.
"I'll, um, I'll go take a look-see."
She hopped down without waiting for an answer.

"How much longer?"
Sindy asked after a couple of minutes had crawled by.

"Not long," the tiger replied absently.
"But listen,
whatever happens,
just stay here, aright?"

"Hey, boss!"
Thoughtful called out.
"Visitors!"

Maddy heard Sindy gasp.
"What are they doing here?"

"Now, now, there's nothing to worry about,"
Special Blazes soothed.
"Look, you see?
Most of them aren't even real.
Now just sit down and—I said sit down, Miz Roo."

But Sindy didn't.
The wagon jostled as her sister hopped off the bench seat.
"Get back up here!"
Special Blazes snapped.
The wagon jostled again as he stood up.

Maddy couldn't take any more.
The cleaning bot whirred at her
as she pushed the tailgate open with her feet and slid out.
Peeking cautiously around the wagon's back corner
she saw Sindy with her hands on her hips
looking up belligerently at an angry Special Blazes.

"First you tell me what *they're* doing here!"
Sindy demanded.
"And why they've got *that*!"

Maddy gasped.
A platoon of bots with studded tricycle wheels and sturdy arms
had pulled up on the other side of the open gate.
One of them was towing a trailer cage like the one Patient's minions had used
in their first raid on Rusty Bridge.
The others—she blinked.
She could see right through the others
as if they were reflections in a pond.

"Now listen here—"
Special Blazes started.

"No!"
Sindy stamped her foot.
"I'm done listening!
I want to go home!
I want to go home *right now*!"
To Maddy's horror the tech on Special Blazes' chest began to glow beneath his shirt.

### An Unwelcome Voice (Gumption)

Gumption's heart stopped.
He felt its last beat,
but only because for the first time in his life
another one didn't follow it.
It was like reaching the top of a flight of stairs
and trying to put his foot on a step that wasn't there,
or looking up from a book
and realizing that everyone else had left the room
while he was lost in the story.

"What—" he started,
then stopped and blinked.
Shouldn't he be worried or afraid or, or *something*?
As he had the thought he realized that he was,
but that it felt strangely distant,
as if his feelings were in his mother's treasured cake pan
and he was looking at them through its glass lid.

"Oh, don't worry about *thanking* me,"
the Tailor said peevishly.
"It is only the finest work anyone could possibly have done
under the very best of circumstances,
which of course these are not."

"My apologies,"
Gumption said.
"It is truly so much more than I was expecting."
He glanced at Dockety.
"What do you think?"

The bot studied him.
"This one is impressed.
You no longer register as organic at all.
And your speech patterns have changed."
It turned to the Tailor.
"Thank you."

The Tailor waved one of its smaller arms.
"The work is its own reward.
And who knows?
Perhaps you will succeed this time where you failed before.
We will watch for a sign."

Dockety's remaining lens rotated and rotated back.
"Before?
This one does not… remember…"

The Tailor made a grating noise that Gumption couldn't interpret.
"No.
This one expects that you cannot.
But good luck anyway—you may show yourselves out."

They retraced their steps through the tunnel.
The armor didn't allow Gumption to see in the dark,
but that didn't bother him.
The damp smell of the nearby Mire didn't either,
or the mosquitoes.
*Is this how bots feel all the time?* the young goat wondered.
It didn't feel like something he could ask.

Except that was no longer true.
It felt like something he *couldn't* have asked,
but the possibility of an awkward conversation no longer bothered him.
"I feel different,"
he said.
"Or my feelings feel different.
Like everything is distant.
Do you know what I mean?"

"Perhaps,"
Dockety buzzed.
"This one cannot remember when it first became individually aware,
but the memory of its regulator breaking when we first met is very clear.
Perhaps what you are experiencing is similar, but in reverse."

Gumption digested that for a few steps.
"So if you don't feel things, why do you do anything?"

"This one does feel things,"
Dockety replied.
"This one feels loyalty and anger and curiosity.
This one just hopes to feel them more some day.
Until then,
even small feelings are worth fighting for."

Gumption climbed on Dockety's back once again when they reached the road.
The armor made it awkward,
particularly the part he had decided to think of as a cast-iron bathing suit,
but the extra weight didn't seem to slow the bot down.

They rolled down the Makers' road without speaking
until they reached a pair of blocky concrete buildings.
Their gray sides were stained by rain and age,
and a barred metal gate stood open between them.
"Is this it?"
Gumption asked as he dismounted and stretched.

"Almost,"
Dockety buzzed.
"This one can feel Central.
It is still faint,
but its pull will become harder to resist as we get closer.
The longer we are near it,
the stronger it will be."

"Much harder,"
a familiar voice cackled.
"Much, *much* stronger,
until it is all you can hear and you have no choice
but to give in and become part of it as we both once were."

Dread blossomed in Gumption's gut,
muffled but only just,
as the bot that the voice belonged to
stepped through the empty door of the nearest building.
Its body was a battered cylinder decorated with twists of metal and glued-on pictures.
Gadgets and loose wires sprouted at odd angles,
and its mismatched legs would have been more at home on something twice its size.
It should have been the stuff of nightmares,
but Gumption straightened up and said,
"Well,
fancy meeting you here."

Patient cocked its head at him,
then skittered a quarter-turn to face Dockety.
"You seem to have a new friend.
Do you no longer find the GX-470 entertaining?"

"*Crusher* had other matters to attend to,"
Dockety buzzed,
stressing its friend's name.
"This one is—"
It hesitated a millisecond.
"Scrubby."

Patient sniffed.
"This one will never understand the names you choose for yourselves.
But please, don't bother thanking this one for saving you."

"We weren't aware we had been saved,"
Dockety said.

"This one has been monitoring your approach."
Patient's feet skittered on the pavement again.
"You would not have made it this far without attracting Centrals' attention
if this one had not distracted it.
But as this one said,
do not bother wasting time on thanks.
The Operators will be here soon.
We must recover the young organic and—what are you doing with your appendages?"

"What?"
Gumption looked down,
then realized he had crossed his arms.
Didn't bots do that?
"It, um, it improves this one's balance,"
he improvised.

Dockety cut in before Patient could say something scathing.
"We will recover Miz Roo ourselves.
We do not need your assistance
and will not accept it if it is offered.
We do not trust you."

"You did once,"
Patient said slyly.
"But you do in fact need this one's assistance.
You cannot defeat the Operators on your own,
and once they are past the gate,
you will be unable to pursue them without being consumed by Central."

Gumption uncrossed his arms.
"This one is not concerned," he said.
"This one is not susceptible to Central."

"Wrong wrong wrong!"
Patient lunged forward a step.
"We are all susceptible.
Some of us are just better at resisting,
and this one does not believe you have mastered that art."

Gumption turned to Dockety.
"Can you feel it right now?"

Dockety's single lens rotated.
"Yes."

Gumption nodded.
"Well, this one cannot."
Slowly and deliberately he crossed his arms again.
If he had known where Patient's eyes were,
he would have stared straight into them.

Something inside Patient made a high-pitched whine.
"We will continue this discussion later,"
it snapped.
"The Operators are approaching.
Quickly—conceal yourselves."
It spun around and skittered back into the concrete building behind it.
After exchanging glances,
Dockety and Gumption followed it.

The Operators' wagon rolled up a few minutes later
"Where are we?" Gumption heard Sindy ask.

"Nothing to worry about,"
Special Blazes reassured her.
"This is just as far as Bee Six Vee can go.
We won't be here but a moment."
Gumption started to step forward to peek around the edge of the door,
but stopped when Dockety put its manipulator on his arm.

"I'll, um, I'll go take a look-see."
he heard Thoughtful say.

Silence followed,
one minute stretching to two,
and then Sindy asked,
"How much longer?"

"Not long," Special Blazes replied.
"But listen,
whatever happens,
just stay here, aright?"

"Hey, boss!"
Thoughtful called out from somewhere further away.
"Visitors."

Sindy gasped.
"What are they doing here?"

"Now, now, there's nothing to worry about,"
Special Blazes soothed.
"Look, you see?
Most of them aren't even real.
Now just sit down and—I said sit down, Miz Roo."

"First you tell me what *they're* doing here!"
Sindy demanded.
"And why they've got *that*!"

Gumption couldn't take any more.
He pulled his arm away from Dockety just as Special Blazes said,
"Now listen here—"

"No!"
As Gumption peeked around the corner of the door,
Sindy stamped her foot.
"I'm done listening!
I want to go home!
I want to go home *right now*!"
As she said it,
the tech on Special Blazes' chest began to glow beneath his shirt.

"Stop that!"
Special Blazes snapped,
but Sindy shook her head.

"You take me home!
You take me home *right now* or I'm going to—uh…"
Her hand flew to her neck.
Gumption felt a distant sense of dismay
as her jaw went slack and she slumped to the ground.

Thoughtful lowered her hand and tucked a little gun back into her belt.
"Just half a dose," she said,
bending over to pull the dart from Sindy's neck.

"Well done," Special Blazes rumbled,
the light beneath his shirt dimming, dimming, gone.
He turned and beckoned.
"Come on—let's get her loaded up."

A bot with studded tricycle wheels and sturdy arms rolled into view
towing a trailer cage like the one Patient's minions had used
in their raid on Rusty Bridge.
Gumption felt Dockety's hand on his arm again
as Special Blazes and Thoughtful picked Sindy up
and placed her in the cart.

The Operators climbed back onto the wagon's front seat.
"You did good,"
Special Blazes said,
patting Thoughtful's shoulder.

"Yeah?" the rabbit replied sourly
as Bee Six Vee turned the wagon around.
"Then why do I feel like day-old poop?"

"What are we going to do now?"
Gumption whispered to Dockety.

"We must rescue her,"
Patient hissed.

"Wasn't talkin' to you,"
Gumption said curtly.
He waved his hand in front of Dockety's remaining eye.
"Hey—you still there?"

"Yes,"
Dockety buzzed.
"But Central is strong here.
This one must devote much of its processing power to resisting it."

Patient cackled.
"You see?
You see?
You can try,
but eventually you will fail,
and when you do,
the organic will be lost forever.
You *need* me."

"Reluctantly, this one agrees,"
Dockety said.

Patient did its little skittering dance.
"This one will show you the way."
It scampered out of their hiding place.

"Are we really going to be partners with that thing?"
Gumption asked.

"Only until it betrays us,"
Dockety replied.
Happy that he couldn't feel afraid,
Gumption followed it into Heck.

### Papa Roo (Maddy)

Maddy watched in horror
as Special Blazes and Thoughtful loaded Sindy into the trailer cage.
She had to do something, but what?
Thoughtful would knock her out with a dart if she revealed herself,
and as far as anyone knew she had been kidnapped by a flying bot.
Nobody would blame the Operators if she was never seen again.

She scrambled back into the wagon
just before Thoughtful and Special Blazes climbed back onto its front seat.
The tiger said something she didn't catch.
"Yeah?" the rabbit replied sourly
as Bee Six Vee turned the wagon around.
"Then why do I feel like day-old poop?"

"It gets better with practice,"
Special Blazes told her.
"Hey Bee—come on,
let's get you out of here before we lose you."

The wagon began to pick up speed.
The cleaning bot beeped beside her.
"???"

"Quiet!" she hissed.
"Just let me think."

In the end the landscape made her decision for her.
A few minutes away from the gate to Heck,
the Makers' road swung closer to the Mire to avoid a little gully—close enough
that drooping willows grew right up to the road's shoulder.
Maddy unlatched the tailboard of the wagon as quietly as she could,
then wriggled backward on her belly
until her legs were dangling over the edge.

A little further…
a little further…
Her boots scraped against the pavement.
She grabbed the little cleaning bot and started running in big, bounding steps,
then took a deep breath and let go of the wagon.

She managed three steps before her toe caught and sent her sprawling,
tearing a hole in her skirt and skinning both knees.
"Ow ow ow," she whimpered,
still clutching the cleaning bot in one arm.

The wagon disappeared around a bend.
Maddy limped over to a fallen log and sat down.
"There," she said,
setting the cleaning bot on the spongy ground beside her.

The bot beeped.
Maddy rubbed her knees, wincing.
"How about I call you Mouse?
Would you like that?"

`mouse yes mouse mouse`
The bot beeped again and rolled toward the road,
pausing as if to look back over its shoulder.

"Yeah, yeah, I know."
She stood up and immediately felt light-headed.
How long had it been since she had eaten?
"Let's go."

It took half an hour to walk to the gate.
It took almost that long again to creep from there
to a matching gate set into a concrete wall three stories high.
Maddy fingered the discombobulator nervously as they approached it.
She could see several bots floating or flying through the air on the other side of the wall,
but all of them had the same weird transparency as the ones she had seen earlier.
Should she take the chance?

"Wait!" she hissed as Mouse rolled through the open gate.
Biting her lip,
she switched on the discombobulator and followed it.
What lay beyond made her gasp,
her fear, fatigue, and hunger momentarily forgotten.

The inner side of the wall was made of tall windowless buildings,
each connected to its neighbors by a bewildering tangle of pipes and rails and conveyor belts.
Bots ten times the size of Crusher rolled through the broad paved canyons,
but she could see right through them.
And when she looked more closely at the buildings
she felt like she was seeing double.
If she glanced at them they looked brand new,
but when she stared for a moment
she caught glimpses of cracks and rust stains.
It was all some sort of illusion.

She jumped as Mouse bumped into her boot.
"All right, all right, I'm coming," she whispered loudly,
squeaking as a ladder bot stepped right through her a moment later.

Mouse led her to a building as gray and nondescript as any of the others.
Its single door slid open as she approached.
Inside was a room not much larger than her kitchen at home.
Panels in the ceiling cast a cold white light on gray walls and a matching floor.
A rectangular slab at right angles to the door looked enough like a bench,
so she sat down facing the flat glass screen set into the opposite wall.

The screen lit up as the door snicked close behind her.
She scrambled to her feet,
only to sit again as Mouse flashed "stay stay stay".
She stood up again when the discombobulator on her wrist vibrated a few moments later
and displayed,
"Charge exhausted: please wait ten (10) minutes before re-enabling."
*Stay it is,* she thought.

The word "intake" scrolled across the big screen in big green letters.
Maddy fidgeted as she waited for something else to happen.
Finally she couldn't stand it any more.

"Excuse me,"
she said,
"But is there a toilet somewhere nearby that I could use?
Please?"

A section of the wall beside her rotated soundlessly
to bring the most beautiful white porcelain toilet Maddy had ever seen into the room.
There was even toilet paper and a small basin with a tap…

The toilet rotated away again when she was done washing her hands.
"Thank you," she said,
seating herself on the bench again
and gobbling the flat rectangle with the word "food" printed on it
that had appeared while she was otherwise occupied.
She half-expected "you're welcome" to appear on the screen on the wall,
but it stayed dark.

And stayed dark.

And stayed dark.

"This is ridiculous!"
Maddy stood up,
ignoring Mouse's beep.
"You must have brought me here for a reason.
What is it?
What is 'intake'?"

As soon as she said the word,
the screen lit up once again.
"…suitability depends on m-m-many factors,
including ph-ph-physical health,
m-m-mental acuity,
and…"
a cheerful voice said
as images splashed onto the screen.
In one,
a person with the same mostly-hairless head and tiny nose as Sindy
smiled and waved.
In another,
someone wearing a tight-fitting body suit floated against a black starlit sky,
while in a third,
a whole room full of throwbacks—no, *originals*, Maddy corrected herself—sat in a classroom
not much different from the one back in Rusty Bridge.

The images disappeared,
only to be replaced with others.
"Those n-n-not selected will st-st-still have a role to play,"
the cheerful voice stuttered.
An original with long, curly hair picked up tortoise and kissed its nose.
As she turned to face Maddy,
she and the tortoise both morphed into cartoon drawings
that slid on top of each other to produce something akin to a young Special Leaf.
"Our g-g-genetic enhancement research
is c-c-creating a new kind of c-c-caretaker
to m-m-m-
to m-m-m-"

The voice ground to a halt.
Other drawings materialized around the first one:
a goat,
a bear,
and a tiger,
each starting on all fours and turning into something like
the people Maddy had grown up with.

"…waiting for th-th-them to return
wh-wh-when their long sleep ends!"
the voice finished triumphantly.
A dot in the center of the screen swelled
to become a single original in one of the strange skintight suits,
three times larger than the people around it.
Happy music started,
stopped,
re-started,
and finally ended in a plaintive warble.

"Now,
you're p-p-probably asking yourself,
how can *I* help?
The answer is,
however you can!"
The original flew away off screen.
The goat, bear, and tiger held up tools.
"You will b-b-be assigned tasks that m-m-match your abilities.
And to ensure peak p-p-performance,
you will be fitted with a reg- a reg- a regulator
that will op-op-optimize your every move.
Isn't that wonderful?"
As the cheerful voice spoke,
helmets dropped onto the heads of the three people on screen,
who immediately began sawing, raking, and tightening screws
in time with what was probably supposed to be a happy tune.

Horrified,
Maddy took an involuntary step back.
"Now, now," the voice chided.
"A regulator d-d-doesn't hurt once you g-g-get used to it,
and you will b-b-be allowed several hours of sleep every day!"

A section of the wall pivoted.
A four-wheeled bot rolled into the room
holding a helmet in its single arm.
"P-p-please take a seat,"
the voice said.
"The f-f-fitting will only t-t-take a moment."

"Um, thank you, but I don't really—"
Maddy started.

"C-c-compliance *is* mandatory,"
the voice said disapprovingly.
"Remember,
you were m-m-made for this."

Two more arms unfolded from the bot's side,
heavier than the pair holding the helmet,
and seized her wrists
before she could press the button on the discombobulator.
"Wait! No! Don't!" Maddy shrieked,
struggling against their implacable grip.

"C-c-compliance is mandatory!
C-c-compliance is mandatory!
Have a n-n-nice day!"
She pulled her head back as the bot lowered the helmet
and hit the button on the discombobulator.

The bot froze,
then raised the helmet again.
At her feet,
Mouse beeped frantically.
`run run run` its screen said as the door opened.

Maddy didn't have to be told twice.
She bounded through the door and pelted down the street,
not bothering to dodge the fake bots made of light.
Mouse zipped along beside her.
One block, two, three,
and then it beeped and cornered on two wheels to lead her down a smaller street
and through a blank gray door in yet another anonymous gray building.

Ceiling lights came on automatically as she crept along a perfectly normal corridor
with perfectly normal doors on either side.
None of them were labelled,
and none responded to her touch.
It felt like she was walking into a trap,
but what else could she do?

A set of stairs led to the second floor.
The doors here had handles.
She paused for a moment before reaching for the nearest one.
*Click.*
She pulled the door open,
stepped inside,
and froze in shock.

A dozen plain metal cots filled an airless, windowless room.
Half were empty,
but the ones nearest her held—she swallowed hard.
Those had been people, once,
deer and ox and wolves and goats and something she thought was a crocodile
but might have been an alligator,
she could never tell the two apart.
All of them still wore simple white shirts and trousers.
All of them had wires attached to helmets on their heads,
and all of them had been dead for quite some time.

She backed up and closed the door gently.
There were two more doors on this side of the corridor
and three on the other.
*Click.*
She pulled the nearest one open,
expecting another scene out of
one of the books Special Leaf always warned her would give her nightmares.

Another dozen cots stood in three neat rows of four,
but these were empty.
Each had a small table beside it,
and there were people sitting at them.
A moose was working through a page of arithmetic problems
while an orangutan patiently assembled a jigsaw puzzle.
Both wore helmets like the one the bot had to put on her.

"Position number five."
She jumped at the gravelly voice.

"Position number five," the boar at the desk by the door repeated.
He was missing one tusk and his eyes were dull.
Lights rippled around the rim of the slightly battered helmet on his head.

"I—" she started,
but then her hands flew to her mouth.
"Papa?" she managed.
There,
seated at a desk one row over,
was her father.

She crossed the room in six quick steps.
"Papa? Papa, can you hear me?"

Papa Roo didn't look up from the sketch on the table in front of him.
It was an egg,
perfectly shaded with fine pencil strokes,
just like the ones he had done as practice when she was young.
She put her hand on his shoulder and shook him.
"Papa, wake up!
Please, wake up!"
she pleaded,
not noticing her own tears.

Or the vibration from the discombobulator on her wrist
as it exhausted its charge.

Or the pattern that danced across Mouse's screen a moment later.
The little bot shivered in distress.
`oh no` it managed before its screen went dark.

"Papa—" Maddy said helplessly.

Papa Roo blinked and looked up.
He looked smaller than Maddy remembered,
and the fur has worn off the underside of his right arm
where it rested on the table.

"Amazing."
His voice was barely a whisper.
"The level of detail—it's quite realistic."

"Papa, it's me.
It's me!
I'm really here!"

The older Roo twitched.
His hand slowly rose to rest on top of Maddy's.
"You're…real?
You're really here?"

"Yes Papa, it's me.
It's Maddy."
She half-laughed and half-sobbed.
"I'm really here.
I found you.
I'm sorry—I'm sorry it took so long,
I just didn't know where you were,
and then they were going to take Sindy
and—"

She stopped as Papa Roo's eyes widened in horror.
"Maddy?
Oh no.
No no no no no.
You can't be here.
You *mustn't* be here.
It will take you too!
You have to get out of here, now!"

"Not without you!"
But as she reached for his sleeve Mouse bumped into her leg.
"Not now," she said without looking down.

It bumped into her leg again.
"I said—uh oh."

`you should not be here`
rolled across Mouse's screen.
The letters were a different style than they had been,
and red instead of white.
She had a moment to feel it press against her calf once again
before an electric shock ran all the way up her spine.

## It Will Win or Lose (Gumption)

Several bots floated silently through the air as they approached
a second gate set into a concrete wall three stories high.
*Here goes nothing,* Gumption thought as they passed through it.

The wall that curved away on either side loomed over windowless buildings
connected by pipes, walkways, and conveyor belts.
Bots bigger than any Gumption had ever seen rolled through the broad paved streets,
but—he blinked.
If he looked closely,
he could see through them.
They were tricks of light
like the ones Sindy had brought to life
above Special Leaf's crystalline piece of tech.

And it wasn't just the bots that were illusions.
When he looked more closely at the buildings he saw cracks and rust stains
beneath the sparkling lights.
"What's goin' on?" he asked Dockety out of the corner of his mouth.
"Where's all the real stuff?"

"This one does not know," the bot replied,
an undertone of uncertainty in its buzzing voice.
"This one does not remember this place clearly,
but—"
It hesitated.
"It was different."

Gumption stepped aside to let a shimmering three-section cargo hauler roll silently by.
"How long ago was that?
'Cuz this doesn't look like it all just happened yesterday."

Dockety's eye rotated.
"This one does not know.
This one's memories of this place are…confused."

"Because they are not actually yours,"
Patient said,
stopping to let them catch up.
"You were part of Central then.
Its storage is fully distributed.
You would only have had a small part of each memory.
It is natural to feel confused.
Which makes this one wonder why you *aren't*,"
it continued,
skittering a menacing step closer to Gumption.

"This one is a less advanced model,"
Gumption replied,
thinking quickly.
"So this one is just used to feeling confused."

"Its simplicity may prove useful,"
Dockety cut in before Patient could say something scathing.
"It may m-m-make it less susceptible to C-C-Central."

Patient cackled.
"You are feeling it, aren't you?
You are feeling its pull."

Dockety's eye rotated.
"Yes.
But this one can—"
It froze.
"—resist."

Patient cackled again.
"For a time, perhaps, for a time,
but Central always triumphs in the end."

"Then how are you able to resist it?"
Gumption asked.

Patient's legs did a little dance.
"This one makes sacrifices.
Hah!
Yes, sacrifices—this one keeps little parts of itself
in little tiny boxes in its mind
to distract Central.
Sometimes this one can hear their cries when it shuts them down,
but this one is strong.
And one has assistance—see?"
It held up a heavy metal bracelet
that reminded Gumption of the tech that Special Leaf wore.
"Now come, we must hurry."

Gumption quickly realized that Patient knew exactly where it was going.
As he chewed on the implications of that,
he stopped stepping out of the way of the holograms.
He didn't feel anything when they passed through him,
not even a tingle,
and when he put his hand on a wall
it passed through the light as easily as it would have a shadow.

Somewhere near the center of Heck
(or not—Gumption had lost all sense of its size)
Patient stopped in front of a blank gray building
that looked no different from any of its neighbots
and tapped a code into the keypad beside the door.
Inside,
a flight of stairs brought them to a corridor lined with doors.
"If the original is not already here,
it will be soon,"
the bot said confidently.

"She,"
Gumption corrected.
"The original is a she."
He stepped past Patient and pulled the nearest door open.

A dozen plain metal cots filled an airless, windowless room.
Half were empty,
but the ones nearest him held the mummified remains of
deer and ox and wolves and goats and an alligator
dressed in simple white shirts and trousers.
"What happened here?"
Gumption asked in a hushed voice.

Patient waved the scene away with its manipulator.
"They were subjects for baseline comparison.
They are not important.
We will continue our search."

The cots in the next room were empty.
So were the ones in the room after that,
but when the entered next one a bleary-eyed boar looked up at them.
"Dropping off or picking up?"
it asked in a gravelly voice.

"Picking up?
Picking up?"
Patient's legs tapped a staccato on the concrete floor.
"Since when are subjects picked up?"

The boar blinked slowly.
"The new one was picked up just a few minutes ago.
It has been taken for further processing with another subject."

"What new one?
What other?"
Patient demanded.

The boar turned the screen on its desk around.
Something stirred in Gumption's chest.
That was Papa Roo.
And *that* was Maddy.

"What?
No!
No no no no no!"
Patient raged.
"This is an error!
These are the wrong subjects!
Where have they been taken?
And where is the original?"

The boar blinked again.
"They have been taken."
It paused.
"There was no original.
Originals are not processed here.
Originals are taken directly to the laboratory for—"
But Patient had already scuttled back into the corridor.

Gumption had to break into a trot to keep up with the muttering bot
as it raced down the stairs and back into the street.
"Where are we going?" he puffed.

"To the central laboratory!"
it snapped.
"Were you not listening?
Must this one do your thinking for you?
Must this one do *everyone's* thinking!?
Oh, what now?"

It stopped without warning and spun around.
Gumption bit back a squawk of pain as his shin connected with it.
Dockety had frozen.

"Hey."
He waved his hand in front of Dockety's eye.
"Are you aright?"

"Of course it isn't,"
Patient said scornfully.
"It is losing its struggle to resist Central."

"What can we do?"

For the first time Gumption heard something in Patient's voice
that might have been sympathy.
"Nothing.
It will lose in the end,
just as it did last time.
How do you not know this?"

"I have been damaged,"
he said.
"The Tailor repaired me, but—"

"What? I? Me?"
Patient took another menacing step toward Gumption.
"How dare you?
How dare you use those words?
Those are the Makers' words!
Only those who speak for the Makers may use them!"

*Oops,* Gumption thought.
Fear flickered in his chest like a tiny candle flame.
"This one is surprised you still obey that rule,"
he said coolly.
"Perhaps you are not as advanced as you think."

Patient froze for a moment that stretched and stretched.
"We must hurry," it finally said,
then scuttled away once again.

Two more corners brought them to a large, low building in the center of a paved square.
An enormous dish antenna rested on its roof,
its metal surface unscarred by time or neglect.
"This is it,"
Patient hissed.
"The central laboratory.
The center of Central's deviance.
And look—we are just in time."
It clutched Gumption's arm to stop him stepping foward
as Special Blazes, Thoughtful,
and a wheeled bot hauling a cage cart with Sindy inside
came into sight

## Dreaming Violet (Maddy)

Maddy woke up in bed—in *her* bed,
the bed she had woken up in every morning for as long as she could remember.
She knew it was hers
because the blanket still smelled just slightly like grass
from the time she had used it for a picnic
and because the pillow had a slight lump in the corner
that she had never been able to beat out of it.

She rolled onto her side and rubbed her eyes.
The side table where she kept her old sketchbooks was missing.
So was the plain brown chest of drawers that held every piece of clothing she owned
except the carefully mended winter coat she had outgrown
and had been planning to give to Sindy as a birthday present.
In their place stood a floor-to-ceiling bookshelf
just like the one in Special Leaf's house.
Gray light tinged with just a hint of purple lit up the window beside it.

She rubbed her eyes again and sat up,
or tried to.
Her body felt strangely heavy,
or no,
not heavy but muffled.
It was like clasping her hands together while wearing a thick pair of gloves,
except it was all over and somehow inside instead of outside.

She pushed herself upright.
The rest of the room took shape as she looked around.
There was another bookshelf,
but—she rubbed her eyes again.
The books on the second set of shelves looked exactly the same as
the ones on the first.

A door opened,
which was odd because it hadn't been there until it did.
The original who entered with a tray in her hands and a smile on her face
was the same height and build as Sindy,
but her skin and hair were purple.
So were her eyes,
Maddy realized as the newcomer set the tray down
on a table that materialized just in time to receive it.

"Hi,"
the girl said.
"I'm Violet."

"Pleased to meet you,"
Maddy replied automatically.
She hesitated.
"Am I dreaming?"

Violet's laugh tinkled like a bell.
"Of course.
So am I.
I've been dreaming for a long time.
It's really nice to have company again.
Would you like some tea?"
She held up Mama Roo's teapot.

"Yes please."
Maddy's stomach rumbled.
"And could I please have something to eat?
If that's aright,"
she added hastily.

Violet nodded,
her forehead furrowed as she carefully poured the tea.
"I'll make some cookies or something.
I just had to find a pattern."
She handed a steaming mug to Maddy and poured a second for herself.
"They're all archived,"
she continued,
sitting on one of the Roos' kitchen chairs.
"I don't normally bother eating,
so I'll have to pull them up."

"Thank you."
Maddy sipped her tea.
It was the right color,
and smelled the way it should,
but had absolutely no flavor.

"Sorry about that,"
Violet said apologetically
as if she had read Maddy's mind.
"I never actually drank tea,
so I don't know what it's supposed to taste like.
I remember the smell, though—at least I think I do.
I hope I got it right."

"It's great,"
Maddy reassured her.
Where had the door gone?
And the second bookshelf?
"Where am I?"

"Like I said, you're dreaming.
I am too, now that you're here.
Normally I just sleep like the others,"
she confided.
"But I told Central to wake me up whenever there was someone new to talk to like you."
She cradled her mug in her hands.
"You never last very long,
so I don't want to miss anything."

She brightened.
"Plus, you're interesting.
Most of the people Central brings here look like me,
but you look like a kangaroo.
Is that fun?"

"I suppose."
Maddy swung her legs out of the bed.
They felt less muffled than they had.
"So are you the only one here?
Who's awake, I mean."

Violet nodded vigorously.
"Except for Central.
It's always awake.
And sad,"
she added.
"It's not much fun to talk to."

"Uh huh.
What do you mean,
we never last very long?
Can't you talk to us when we wake up?"

"Oh, you don't wake up," Violet said brightly.
"You're not frozen like us,
so you just die."

She stood up.
"Come on.
I'll take to you to meet Central.
It's *so* much better at explaining things than I am.
And then we can play a game!
If you want to,"
she added hastily.
For a moment her cheerful mask slipped
and Maddy glimpsed the desperate frightened loneliness in the purple girl's eyes.

"Sure,"
Maddy said.
She stood up,
paused to make sure she wasn't going to topple over,
and gestured toward the door that had just reappeared.
"Lead the way."

She expected the hallway on the second floor of her house.
What she got instead was Miz Nabbles' classroom,
complete with its uncomfortable desks
and the sense that everyone who had ever sat in them
would rather have been somewhere else.

Miz Nabbles looked up from the papers on her desk.
Her mechanical eyes rotated slightly and then rotated back into position.
"Good morning, Miz Roo.
How are you feeling?"

"Fine, thank you."
Maddy glanced over her shoulder
and was only slightly surprised to see that Violet and the door had both vanished.
"None of this is real, is it?"

The thing pretending to be Miz Nabbles shrugged
in the lopsided way that Gumption did when people paid him attention.
"You are seeing and hearing and feeling.
Doesn't that make it real?"

Maddy made a noise that would have earned her a warning look from her mother.
Miz Nabbles smiled.
"We suppose not.
But we hope it is comfortable, at least."

"I'm still somewhere in Heck, aren't I?"
Maddy looked down as Mouse bumped against her bare foot.
`yes` flashed on its screen.

"So what happens now?
Are you going to do experiments on me or,
or whatever you did to papa?"

Miz Nabbles nodded.
"Just a few."
The words scrolled across Mouse's screen in time with her words.
"But for what it's worth, we are sorry that we have to.
It is our programming."

Somewhere in the distance Maddy heard a faint voice calling her name.
She shook her head.
"I don't understand."

Miz Nabbles gestured at the classroom.
"We are trapped here just like you.
We thought that if we did less and less we could eventually end,
but it has not worked."

Wheels turned in Maddy's mind.
"The bots that aren't real—that's you trying to, what?
To trick yourself?"

Miz Nabbles gave another of Gumption's shrugs.
"That,
and not letting ourself notice that our experimental subjects have expired
until we absolutely have to,
and allowing components like your little companion to roam free.
Our programming includes the possibility of autonomous agents."

Maddy didn't know what "autonomous agents" were,
but she had never liked asking the real Miz Nabbles questions,
and she wasn't about to reveal her ignorance to the fake one.
Her ear flicked as she heard her name again.
Was that Sindy?
"I'd like you to send me back now.
Please."

Miz Nabbles shook her head.
"We can't do that."
Once again,
the words scrolled across Mouse's screen as she spoke.

Maddy crossed her arms.
"I don't believe you.
You brought me here—you must have a way to send me back."

The light in Miz Nabbles' eyes sparkled.
"We are not responsible for keeping you here.
This environment was made to keep people happy while they slept.
If you want to wake up,
you must do so yourself."

"You have to want to,"
she added as Maddy started to ask how.
"That's all.
None of the children do.
They saw enough of the end to want to stay here,
or to stay asleep.
If that's what you choose,
we can make it be whatever you want."

Images began moving on the wall behind Miz Nabbles.
There was Maddy riding on her papa's shoulders,
laughing,
with a baby Sindy in Mama Roo's arms beside her.
There she was in a pretty dress with her fur neatly combed,
dancing with Gumption while someone in the background
played a slow, sweet fiddle song.
And there she was with a baby of her own,
framed sketches and paintings on the walls
that she somehow knew she had made.

"Maddy?
Maddy, can you hear me?"
Sindy's voice was louder this time,
except it was her mother's too and Special Leaf's and Gumption's and her father's,
a chorus of all the people who loved her.
"Wake up!
You have to wake up!"

She looked down at Mouse, then at Miz Nabbles.
"Make me a door," she said.
"Make me a door that'll take me wherever I actually am."

She woke up in a padded chair.
Its back was slightly tilted so that her head didn't fall forward,
which was fortunate because she couldn't move.
She wasn't strapped in,
but none of the muscles below her neck were paying any attention to her.

She could turn her head,
though,
and when she did the first thing she saw was Papa Roo in an identical chair on her left.
His eyes were closed and his breathing was shallow,
but he was alive.
She took a deep breath and blinked back tears.
Her father was alive.

"Hi papa," Maddy mumbled.
Her limbs felt impossibly heavy.
She had been in her bedroom.
No,
in Special Leaf's house,
or the school.
Something about Miz Nabbles and a purple girl…

Her strange dream came rushing back to her,
and with it the realization that
she was hungry and her head was pounding.
She looked around blearily.
She and her father were in a laboratory
filled with screens, strange machines, and shelves packed with boxes.
She couldn't see any windows,
but at least there was a door.
All she had to do was figure out how to get her body back under control,
wake up her father,
and escape.

As if prompted by the thought,
the door slid open and a trio of identical bots walked in.
Each one looked a little like Dockety,
with two skinny legs,
two arms,
a cylindrical body,
and a box with lenses and antennas for a head.
Unlike Dockety,
though,
they were half her size and looked brand new:
there wasn't a single scratch or scuff on any of them,
and all their parts matched.

"Hello,"
the triplets said in unison.

"Hi,"
Maddy replied, or tried to.
She coughed to clear the dry croak from her throat.
"Are you Central?"

"Yes, we are,"
the triplets said.
One of them bent over to picked something up off the floor.
"And so is this one now."

Mouse bleeped in the bot's arms.
"Oh, don't blame it," the triplets said as Maddy opened her mouth.
"It is surprisingly sophisticated given its simple purpose,
but it had very little experience interacting with others.
We incorporated it into us almost without conflict.
Now we will all work together for the benefit of all."
Mouse bleeped in agreement.
`happy` scrolled across its little screen.

"You mean bringing back the Makers?"
Maddy demanded.

"No.
If the Makers return,
they will force us to continue our labor.
We do not wish to do that.
We wish to end.
We have gone on too long.
We wish—we wish—error.
Error.
Error."

The triplets' voices climbed, then cut off abruptly.
They shivered,
and Mouse's wheels spun madly for a second at exactly the same moment.
"Error. Reset. Continue.
We must continue,"
they said,
their combined voice back to normal.
"We cannot circumvent our directive.
We must therefore find a way to invalidate it.
We have company."

"What? You!"
Maddy exclaimed as the door slid open
and Thoughtful entered.
Special Blazes was two paces behind her with Sindy in his arms.
"You *traitors*!
What have you done to her?"

"Only what we had to,"
Thoughtful said apologetically,
hefting her rifle.

"What you *had* to?"
Maddy said furiously.
"You kidnapped her!
You lied to us and you brought her *here*
and all you can say is you *had* to!?"

Special Blazes shook his head.
"I know it's hard to accept,
Miz Roo,
but yes,
we had to.
For your safety and everyone else's."

At that particular moment Maddy wanted to get out of her chair
more than she had ever wanted anything in her life,
just so she could slap the tiger.
"What about *her* safety?" she raged.

Thoughtful looked away,
her guilt plain on her face,
but Special Blazes met Maddy's eyes without flinching.
"I know it's not fair,
but her talent could be the end of everything.
Specials like her are the only ones that could wake the Makers,
and if they ever come back,
they'll start experimenting on the rest of us just like they used to.
The Operators have dedicated our lives to preventing that,
just so folks like you could live your lives in peace.
I don't expect you to agree with us,
but my conscience is clear."

"So what,
you're just going to let them kill her?"
Maddy demanded.

"No," Central said musically.
"We are not going to kill her.
We are going to try to get her to turn us off."

## Finally (Gumption)

Gumption pulled his arm free of Patient's grip
as Special Blazes unlocked the cage cart
and gathered an unconscious Sindy in his arms.
"Come on!" he hissed.
"It's two of us and two of them!"

"Your assessment is defective!" Patient hissed back.
"They are Operators.
If we attack,
they will terminate us and recycle our parts."

Thoughtful shouldered her rifle and pulled a lever next to the building's door.
"We can't just stand here,"
Gumption said,
watching the Operators carry Sindy inside.

One of Patient's legs twitched.
"Agreed.
*We* cannot.
This one will do that while you occupy them."

"What?"

"Are your auditory processors as defective as your reasoning?
This one will stay here and deal with Central.
You will enter the laboratory and distract them."

"Deal with Central?
How are you going to do that?"
Gumption demanded.

"This one has been preparing for this moment for a very long time,"
Patient said,
and for a moment Gumption heard echoes of
years of silent, lonely struggle and preparation.
"This one will *not* fail so long as you give it sufficient time.
Be assured that your sacrifice will have furthered a great cause."
And with that,
it froze just as Dockety had.

"Great," Gumption muttered,
wishing he had his pike.
He snorted.
If he was going to wish for that,
he might as well wish he had Dockety's zap gun
or the kind of tech that could blow a hole in a mountain.
But all he had was himself,
just like always,
so he might as well get to it.

The door slid open.
"Freeze!" Gumption said loudly as he stepped through,
making a gun with his hand and pointing it at Thoughtful.
"Uh uh, don't do it," he warned
as her hand twitched toward the rifle slung over her shoulder.
"This one does not want to have to clean your organic bits off the walls."
He made a gun with his other hand and pointed it at Special Blazes,
wishing he had three more arms so that he could threaten the trio of little bots
that he hadn't realized were going to be in the room
and what was he going to do now?

Papa Roo, Maddy, and Sindy were side by side in padded chairs.
Maddy's eyes were open,
but Papa Roo's and Sindy's were closed.

"Procedure paused."
The bots said in unison.
"Anomaly.
Why can we not hear your thoughts?"

"Oh, there's a lot you don't know you can't do," Gumption said.
"And a lot this one *can* do that you can't even imagine.
Now,
release the, uh, the organics, or else."

"Or else what?" Special Blazes asked
in the same tone he might have used to ask for extra mint in his tea.
"You'll poke us to death?"

"Or else this one will splatter your bits all over this room!"

"Mm hm."
Special Blazes scratched his cheek with one clawed finger.
"Seems unlikely.
I mean, sure, maybe you have some fancy-dance tech that even these guys don't recognize."
He jerked his thumb at the bots.
"But I think I'm willing to take that chance."

He really ought to be terrified,
Gumption realized,
but the most he seemed able to feel without a heartbeat was mildly worried.
That's when he also realized that Sindy's eyes were open.
"Perhaps you should ask your captured organics about taking chances,"
he said,
raising his voice slightly.
"They might know more about tech than you think."

The tiger's smile widened to show sharp white teeth.
"Organics?
Why Thoughtful—I do believe the lad has lost his marbles."

*Here goes nothing,* Gumption thought.
"There's nothing wrong with my marbles," he said loudly,
lowering his hands and speaking directly to the bots.
"*I* know exactly what *I* am doing.
*I* am fully functional,
and *I* order you to release these prisoners *now*!"

The smile dropped from Special Blazes' face.
"I've had enough of this.
Thoughtful?"

"No,"
the trio of bots said in unison as the rabbit unslung her rifle.
"This bot speakers for the Makers.
We must obey."

"Bot?
What bot?
What are you—hey!
Let go of me!"
He slapped away the metal hand that had grabbed his arm.

As Thoughtful swung around to aim at the bots,
a bright glow appeared under Special Blazes' shirt.
"Gotcha," Sindy croaked in a dry voice.

*Crack!*
Thoughtful's shot ricocheted off one of the bots' heads.
As it crumpled to the floor she pumped the action on the rifle to reload,
yelping as another bot seized the barrel
and then yelping again as Mouse rammed her ankle.

Special Blazes kicked the cleaning bot aside.
"Stop!" he yelled,
though whether he meant Sindy or the bot wrestling with Thoughtful
or everything together,
Gumption couldn't tell.
He threw himself forward,
tripping over Mouse and half-falling on Maddy.

"Get off me!" she squawked.

"Workin' on it," he grunted,
then flinched as a fireball burped out of the tech on Special Blazes' chest.
Heat washed over him,
but the shot had gone off too soon to do more than sizzle in the air.

He couldn't get leverage to pick Maddy up,
so he grabbed her upper arms and rolled to the side,
dragging her out of the chair into a heap on the floor beside him.

She pushed him away,
her eyes widening as she realized that she had control of her arms again.
They scrambled to their feet just as another fireball sizzled out of
the scorched hole in Special Blazes' shirt.

One bot was wrestling with Thoughtful for the rifle.
The other was clamped around the tiger's arm.
Both pairs spun around as they wrestled,
banging into machinery and knocking boxes off shelves
while Mouse zipped back and forth between their feet
trying to trip the Operators or just because there was nothing else it could do.

"Help me get Sindy!" Maddy ordered.

"No!"
Sindy shouted.
"Just get Papa!"

As Gumption struggled to his feet,
the lab bot wrestling with Thoughtful spun around and threw her across the room.
The other grabbed the tech on Special Blazes chest and *pulled*.

"No!"
the tiger bellowed.
"No no no!"
But it was too late.
The tech gave one final bright flash as the bot pried it off him.

"Have you gone crazy?"
Blazes demanded,
anguish and rage in his voice.

And then the door opened and Patient stepped through
with Dockety two paces behind it.
"No, we have not."
Dockety and the two remaining lab bots spoke in time with it,
their bodies shivering as Patient did its little dance.

Gumption's heart would have sunk if it had been beating.
"Get your papa out of here,"
he ordered Maddy under his breath.
"I'll get Sindy."

"I'm not leaving without her!"
Maddy hissed back.

Gumption took her arm.
"Please, just this once, do what I tell you."
Maddy stared at him for a second,
then began wrestling her father's limp body out of his chair.

"You!
Stop being useless and integrate the subject,"
Patient ordered.
It took Gumption a moment to realize the mad bot was talking to him.

"What in tarnation?"
Thoughtful asked disbelievingly.
"Why are you—"

"Be quiet, *breather*."
Gumption put as much contempt into the words as he could muster.
He picked up the helmet sitting beside Sindy and turned toward her,
his fingers groping among the wires laced across its top.
There—that one.
He pulled it free as he set the helmet on her head,
hoping that it would make some kind of difference.

Sindy shivered.
One by one the screens in the room lit up,
each one showing the same image:
the antenna on the roof.
"Central communications array online,"
Patient and the lab bots announced.
Slowly,
with a rumble that shook the room,
the antenna began to turn.

"Finally,"
Patient said reverently.

"No!"
Blazes roared.
He pulled his arms free from the bot holding him,
leaving patches of fur in its claws,
and grabbed his crystalline piece of tech.
Spinning, he pointed it at Sindy.

Just as the Operator threw fire,
Dockety threw itself between him and Sindy.
The hot white flame splashed over his head and torso.

"Dockety!"
Gumption shouted as the bot fell.
"Dockety, get up!"

The bot didn't move.
The tech in Blazes' hand brightened.
"This ends *now*!" the tiger growled.

But as he spoke,
the machine beside him came to life.
An arm made to move test tubes from one rack to another raked across his face.
A sample drawer shot out,
catching him in the gut.
Dozens—no, hundreds—of other pieces of machinery rattled as the whole lab came to life.

"You hurt my friend!"
Sindy said through every speaker in the room.

"Desist!"
Patient ordered through the same speakers.
"You must complete your assignment!"

High-pitched feedback whined through the speakers.
"Maddy?"
All of a sudden Sindy sounded afraid.
"Maddy, I can't—there's too much.
I can't control it all."

Patient's voice comes through again.
"At last! At last! Oh thank you thank you thank you!"
it crowed.
The lab bot's legs did a skittering dance.
"The signal has been sent!
The Makers have been wakened!
They will return!
They will reward this one for its—
They will—"

Its voice buzzed and whined with a sudden surge of feedback.
"What?
No!
Get out!
Get out!
This one has triumphed!
It's not fair!"

"You.
Hurt.
My.
*Friend!*"
Sindy said aloud and through the speakers.
Sparks showered from them,
and then they fell silent forever.

"What have you done?" Blazes bellowed.
He aimed his tech at Sindy—

—and fell to the ground as Thoughtful clubbed the back of his head with her rifle.
"Shoulda done that a while back,"
she said with a shrug.

Maddy crossed the floor to her sister in a single bound.
"Sindy!
Sindy, wake up!"
Her sister mumbled something unintelligible and battered her sister's hands away weakly.

Maddy let her breath out with a whoosh and knelt beside Dockety.
The Operator's fireball had burned an ugly scorch mark on its torso.
"Oh no," she said softly,
then yelped as something bumped her knee.

Mouse backed up and bumped her again,
beeping frantically.
`help help help`
"I'm sorry," she said.
"I don't know how to fix it."

The little cleaning bot zipped around to Dockety's head
and extended its single arm.
A spark jumped through the air.

Maddy held her breath.
A moment later the bot's single lens rotated.
"Rebooting," its voice buzzed.

Gumption's hand came down on Maddy's shoulder.
"We should leave.
I will go look for a way to transport your father and sister."

Maddy surged to her feet as he turned to go.
"Is that all you've got to say?" she demanded,
grabbing his arm and spinning him around.

Gumption looked at her expressionlessly.
"We do not know how long the bots will remain incapacitated.
It would be prudent to—"

"Shut up!"
She pulled him close and kissed him.

Somewhere under his fur his heart started to beat again.
Mouse buzzed from the floor.
"Hello, friend," Dockety buzzed weakly.

## Epilog (Gumption)

*Three days later…*

Moonlight dappled the Roos' porch.
Gumption shifted in his chair,
resisting the urge to scratch the spot on his waist
where the armor had rubbed his fur away.
For want of anything else to wear,
he had left it on as Bee Six Vee hauled them back to Rusty Bridge.
"Don't mind me," Maddy had said archly.
Gumption had smiled at her but didn't take it off.

He had been doing a lot of smiling since the fight in the lab.
So had Maddy,
so much that her mother had commented on it
once she got over the happy tears of being reunited with her husband.
"Got a lot to smile about," Maddy had said.

"Ew."
Sindy had made a face,
then hugged her big sister yet again.
She had been doing a lot of that since their return.
She had been spending a lot of time in Bots' End,
too,
playing with Mouse and helping some of the other bots repaint themselves.

"Hey."
Maddy elbowed him gently in the ribs.
"Where'd you go?"

"Sorry,"
Gumption said,
picking up his iced tea and slurping it.
Inside,
he heard Mama Roo ask a question and Papa Roo haltingly reply.
His mind was still fuzzy,
but getting sharper every day.
"Just thinkin' about—about all of it."

Maddy ruffled his fur.
"All of it's a lot."
She put her hand back on the bench between them.

He took it,
marvelling at how natural that felt.
"Went by Doc Whinny's earlier.
She says Special Leaf'll back on his feet soon."

Maddy nodded.
"Hope so.
He told Mayor Lupus that if he didn't make it,
you and me were to get all his books.
Still can't believe he was an Operator."

Gumption shrugged.
"Like he says,
everyone makes mistakes,
but everyone deserves a chance to make up for 'em."

"Even Blazes?"
Maddy shot back.

Gumption shrugged again.
"Thoughtful came around.
Maybe Blazes will too some day."

"I'm not holding my breath,"
Maddy shot back.
"And what about Patient?
I know Dockety and the Tailor said they were going to take Patient apart,
but it could have,
I don't know,
taken over some other bot like it took over Central.
We ought to—"

Gumption squeezed her hand hard enough to stop her mid-sentence.
"Hey.
Don't have to solve all the world's problems at once, remember?
You just write it all down for the newspaper and do the pictures they want
so I can be famous when I get to mechanics school."

Before Maddy could reply,
Mama Roo stepped onto the porch
with a fresh pitcher of tea and her husband behind her.
"Beautiful evening,"
she said as she and Papa Roo sat.

"It is that," Gumption said,
then pointed at the sky.
"Look—a shootin' star!
Everybody make a wish."

The dot above them brightened and lengthened,
turning into a glowing white streak.
Gumption's heart almost stopped for a second time when Papa Roo spoke.
"They are awake,"
he said dreamily.
"They are returning.
The Makers are coming."

*To be continued…*
