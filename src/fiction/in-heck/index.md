## Mail (Maddy)

Maddy was sketching the willow tree in the main square of Rusty Bridge
when one of the Ox brothers hollered,
"Mail's coming!"
*Finally*, she thought,
giving her drawing one last despairing look.
The branches were in the right places,
but somehow the lines on the page didn't capture
the drooping greenery in front of her.

She sighed and tucked her sketchbook into
the blue canvas satchel her father had made for her tenth birthday.
A lot had happened since then,
but at least now she knew he might still be alive.

"Waitin' on anythin' in particular?"
a familiar voice drawled behind her.

Maddy jumped, startled.
Mayor Lupus smiled down at her,
a mug of tea in her hand.
It was a kindly smile,
but it still showed a lot of teeth.
"Mama sent off for some seeds," Maddy said.
"And my chores were all done, and—"

"—and it's a beautiful day so why not sit for a bit?"
the old wolf finished, nodding agreeably.
She jerked her chin toward Maddy's bag.
"You're gettin' a lot better.
Your pa would be pleased."

"Thank you," Maddy mumbled.
Mayor Lupus had a way of looking at someone
that made them feel like she could read their mind.
That was part of why the village kept electing her:
most people felt guilty just thinking about running against her.

A double handful of people gathered to gossip as they waited for the mail.
Zeke Bear had finally fixed the smokehouse
that had been knocked down during the attack a few months ago.
He might not especially like the bots who had helped save them,
but he would allow that they were useful.
The apple orchard was draining properly for the first time in forever,
and there wasn't a dull pair of scissors in town.

"Still, owing a bot favors makes me uncomfortable,"
Miz Tumbly sighed loudly,
shaking her graying mane.

Mayor Lupus tipped the dregs of her tea into a planter.
"I reckon lettin' 'em settle in beside us is payment enough,"
she said conversationally.
"And if any trouble shows up, well…"
She rapped her gnarlywood cane against her mechanical leg.
"Fightin' bots is a lot easier when you have a few on your side."

Miz Tumbly's whiskers twitched slightly at the rebuke.
She had put herself forward for election the year before,
but had garnered even fewer votes than the mayor's previous challenger.
"A lot of folks think it's time for a change,"
Mama Roo had explained to Maddy afterward,
"But if she's the change, they'd rather wait."

"Aaaaand right on time,"
Mayor Lupus said as the mailbot came into view.
Eighty-Eight Able-Six ("but call me Able") looked like three metal boxes
perched on top of one another
with a single small wheel up front
and two spoked cartwheels in the rear.
It only had one arm,
and like many of the refugee bots it had patches and welds from years of mending,
but someone had made it a blue hat with a little tin badge,
and it was the most cheerful bot Maddy had ever met.

Able rolled to a halt and doffed its hat.
"Good morning, one and all," it said jauntily,
replacing its hat and then opening a hatch in its side.
"Got letters, got parcels, even got a newspaper from Sandy Bend."
Its periscope cameras swivelled from side to side
as it handed out what it had brought.

Someone bumped Maddy's elbow.
"Hey,"
Gumption said.

"Hey," she said back.
He had slicked down his fur again the way some of the older goats did.
It made them look tough,
but on Gumption—she stifled a sigh.
It had taken him a long time to heal after the attack.
Once he was back on his feet he had started using the punching bag
in Zeke Bear's barn
and doing militia drills with an old pike.
She had hoped they would spend time together that summer,
just the two of them,
but "together" seemed to be the last thing on his mind.

Gumption jerked his chin at the mailbot.
"Anything for you?"

She was about to say, "No," when Able called her name.
She traded a glass penny for a letter in a plain brown envelope
with "Miz Madalena Roo, Resident in Rusty Bridge" written in strong square letters on its front.

Maddy took a slow breath.
"Well? Aren't you gonna open it?"
Gumption asked.

She shook her head.
"Not here.
You want to go look in on Special Leaf?"

Gumption shrugged.
"Sure.
Has he got Sindy doin' magic tricks again?"

"Ssh!"
Maddy glanced around involuntarily.
Special Leaf insisted that they keep her sister's abilities secret.

Gumption shrugged again.
"Sorry," he muttered,
and then,
"Hey—look!"

"What in tarnation?" Mayor Lupus exclaimed.
A murmur ran through the crowd
as two bots entered the square with a pair of muddy, sullen goats between them.
Dockety was in the lead,
its mis-matched arms swinging as it strode toward the crowd.
Its companion Crusher brought up the rear on heavy treads,
and in between—

"Are those boys *tied up*?"
Miz Tumbly gasped,
her ears folding down in shock.

"Quiet down," Mayor Lupus said sharply.
The crowd parted to let her through,
her cane clicking on the cobblestones.

"Morning," she said to Dockety.
"I thought Able had brought all the mail,
but it seems you have somethin' for us too."

The lenses on the front of Dockety's head rotated a quarter turn and back
with a faint *zick zick*.
"These ones were apprehended
while attempting to take possession of items that do not belong to them,"
it said,
its voice buzzing slightly.
"We request punitive measures to deter further attempts."

Mayor Lupus sucked in her cheeks.
"Is that right, boys?
Were you stealin'?"

"We wasn't!"
Bluster Goat said vehemently.
"We were just tryin' to find out if they been hidin' stuff,
and we did!
They got weapons stashed away!
All kinds of them!"

"I said quiet down!"
Mayor Lupus snapped as people began muttering.
"That's a pretty serious accusation.
You best be sure of your ground."

"Bravo seen 'em too," Bluster said.
His twin brother nodded vigorously.
"Big pile o' stuff laid out in a shed."

"Those are not weapons,"
Dockety buzzed.
"They are spare parts.
Many of us still require repairs."

"Spare parts my tail!" Bluster said hotly.
"They got a zap gun an' saw blades and all sorts."

"Dockety?
Any o' that true?"
the mayor asked.
Her tone was still light,
her ears had flattened too.

"These possess several saw blades," the bot acknowledged.
It gestured at Crusher.
"This one has been using them to clear brush."

"And the zap gun?"

"It is not operational."
The bot's lenses rotated back and forth again.
"But if we are able to repair it,
we will use it only for defensive purposes."

"Says *you*,"
Miz Tumbly said just loudly enough to be heard.

Mayor Lupus scowled.
"Would have been neighborly to let us know you had that."

"Understood," Dockety said.
"These will do so in future."

"And you two,"
the mayor continued,
turning to the goat twins.
"It's not your place to be pokin' around like that.
No,
don't interrupt me,
that's just going to make me cranky.
You're both on ditch duty for the next month,
and if you do somethin' lump stupid like this again
you'll be lookin' back on ditches like they were apple pie.
You got that?"

Bluster opened his mouth to protest,
but snapped it shut when his twin kicked his leg.
"Yes'm," they said in sullen unison.

"All right, then."
Mayor Lupus nodded at Dockety to untie them.

"Let's get out of here," Blsuter snapped at his brother
once they were free.
They stalked away side by side,
their boots clomping on the cobblestones.

"Those boys make me *so* mad!"
Maddy grouched to Gumption.
"They'd be chained up in Heck or worse
if it weren't for Dockety."

"I guess,"
Gumption said noncommittally.

"You don't think so?"
Maddy demanded hotly.

"I didn't say that!"
Gumption protested.
"But Miz Tumbly was by for tea yesterday,
and she and my ma and pa were all sayin'
we don't really know much about them.
I like havin' 'em here,"
he added hastily,
anticipating Maddy's outrage.
"But she said—Miz Tumbly, I mean—that they call us 'breathers'."

"Well, we call 'em a lot worse than that,"
Maddy snapped.

Gumption threw up his hands.
"I don't!
I like 'em better than I like a lot o' people,
you know that!
I'm just sayin' a lot of folks aren't as quick with change as you."

Whatever Maddy might have said next was cut off
by a pair of voices shouting,
"Fight! Fight!"

## The Operators (Gumption)

"What now?"
Mayor Lupus asked,
exasperated,
as the twins ran back into the square.

Bluster bent over and put his elbows on his knees to catch his breath.
"Some travelers just come off the road!"
Bravo panted.
"An' the bots are fightin' with 'em!
They got guns an' tech an' everythin'!"

Whatever Mayor Lupus might have said next was cut off
by a sizzle and a sharp *crack!*
A fireball shot into the air
from the other side of the blacksmith's,
leaving a trail of smoke behind it.

"You!" Mayor Lupus barked,
jabbing a finger at Maddy.
"Fast as you can,
go an' get Special Leaf!
The rest of you, stay here!"
She shouldered past the gaping onlookers and trotted back the way the twins had come
as another fireball followed the first into the sky.
People hesitated,
exchanged looks,
and followed after her.

Gumption looked around
just as Maddy rounded the corner on her way to Special Leaf's.
He took one step to follow her,
swore,
and chased after the crowd instead.

He caught up with them in time to hear Mayor Lupus shout, "Enough!"
Dockety and Crusher stood side by side on the street facing four strangers,
each looking more dangerous than the one before.
The rabbit had a long rifle on her shoulder
and a slouch hat pulled down over her ears.
The armor on the six-legged mulebot beside her put Special Leaf's shell to shame.
Behind them was a tiger with a black patch over one eye,
his hands raised as if to throw rocks.
A bear carrying almost as much gear as the mulebot brought up the rear.
She wore the same dark green jacket with black collar and cuffs
as the rabbit and tiger,
while the mulebot was painted in matching camouflage.

"Operators," Gumption breathed.

"No kidding."
Bluster elbowed him hard,
but his eyes were just as wide as Gumption's.

"Anyone mind explainin' what's goin' on here?"
Mayor Lupus said,
her tone making it clear that "no thank you" wasn't an acceptable answer.

"My apologies, Mayor Lupus,"
the tiger replied,
lisping slightly around his fangs.
"These two friends of yours?"

"They're neighbors."
She flicked an ear.
"But you do have me at a disadvantage."

"Special Blazes at your service,"
the tiger replied,
tapping a finger against the brim of his hat.

The crowd let out its collective breath.
"I *knew* it," Gumption said under his breath,
ignoring another withering look from Maddy.

Special Blazes was *famous*.
Every story in the newspaper about his exploits said so:
"The famous Special Blazes has triumphed again!"
The Case of the Snorkeling Smugglers,
the Shootout at Half-Heart Pass,
his year-long pursuit of the villainous Mattock sisters—Gumption had devoured them all
despite Maddy's disdain for "sensationalism".

"Well,
Special,
it's an honor to have you here,"
Mayor Lupus said.
"Oh,
and may I introduce Special Leaf?"

The elderly tortoise had arrived without Gumption noticing,
Maddy two steps behind him.
He was wearing a shapeless gray sweater
that Mama Bear had knit for him the winter before last,
and had an old blue scarf wrapped around his neck as well.
He peered at the Operators through his little round glasses
as if trying to decide whether they were books that needed re-shelving.

The rabbit doffed her hat as Special Blazes dipped his head deferentially.
"It's an honor" the tiger rumbled.

"Thank you,"
Special Leaf said in a slightly fuddled tone.
"As the mayor says,
Crusher and Dockety are neighbors.
I'm sure they didn't mean to scare you."

The bear behind Special Blazes muttered something
that may or may not have been,
"We weren't scared."
The tiger inclined his head.

"Glad to hear it.
My apologies if we overreacted."

Mayor Lupus turned her head.
"Dockety?" she said as the moment stretched.
"Anything you'd like to stay to the Special?"

The bot's lenses rotated.
"Welcome to Rusty Bridge."
It warbled at Crusher,
who lowered its massive arms reluctantly.

"Well,
I'm glad that's sorted,"
Special Leaf said brightly.
"If you'd like some tea,
you'd be very, um…"
He gestured vaguely in the direction of his house.

Special Blazes dipped his head again.
"Thank you,
but what we'd like most right now is a chance to wash up
and chat with the mayor."

The mulebot made a grinding noise.
The corner of Special Blazes' mouth quirked.
"Or in Bee Six Vee's case,
a bit of oil,"
he amended.
"And miz mayor,
if you can spare a bit of time for conversation,
I'd be grateful for that as well."

Mayor Lupus waved the three flesh-and-blood Operators toward the square.
The townspeople dithered and buzzed for a few moments,
then decided in ones and twos that their chores weren't going to do themselves
and headed for home.

"You ever seen Operators before?"
Gumption asked Special Leaf.

The old tortoise nodded.
"Not in some years," he said quietly,
all traces of fuddlement gone from his voice.

"Why do you think they're here?"

Special Leaf shook his head.
"I wish I knew.
But please,
be very, very careful what you say,
especially around Blazes.
He is every bit as smart as the stories say,
and the less he knows about Sindy,
the better."

The threesome walked back to Special Leaf's house in silence.
"Done for the day?"
Maddy asked her sister once they were inside,
ruffling the hair on top of Sindy's head.

"Just let me finish this chapter,"
Sindy said without looking up from her book.

"You're welcome to take it with you,"
Special Leaf said gently.
The battle with the bots had added more wrinkles to Special Leaf's green-gray hide,
but his eyes were still bright behind his little round glasses.

"But this is the most exciting part!
Please?"
Sindy pleaded.

Maddy looked at Gumption, who shrugged.
"I don't mind."
He was supposed to spend the day weeding his family's vegetable garden.
It wasn't the worst job in the world,
but even if he wore his father's waxed cotton slicker
his fur would get soaked and muddy,
and stooping over would make his mended ribs ache.
On the other hand,
at least Maddy had asked before making a decision.

"Five minutes,"
Maddy told her sister sternly.

Special Leaf nodded toward the kitchen.
The two teenagers followed him into it.
"How's she doing?" Maddy asked
as Gumption plopped himself down in his usual chair,
then winced at a twinge in his ribs.

"Very well,"
the old tortoise said.
He fished a small metal-rimmed rectangle of black glass out of his pocket.
"I came by this up years ago.
Never knew what it did,
but she picked it up this morning
and all of a sudden it was full of pictures.
And not just any pictures,"
he confided.
"They were from the book she was reading.
It was like it read her mind."

"That's great," Gumption said when Maddy didn't respond.
Her sister was one of those rare people with no tail,
no whiskers or scales,
and no fur except for the wiry black tuft on her head.
When other children wanted to be cruel they called her a throwback,
but every piece of tech she touched responded to her.

Every time Maddy thought about what that might mean it scared her,
Gumption elbowed her in the ribs to take her mind off it.
"Aren't you going to tell him?"

Special Leaf wrinkled his forehead,
which was as close as he could get to raising his nonexistent eyebrows.
Maddy reluctantly pulled the letter out of her satchel.
"I was wondering when that would arrive," Special Leaf said.
He opened the breadbox on the counter behind him,
took out a butternut cookie,
and offered it to Maddy.

"What's this for?" she asked.

"If it's good news, for celebrating," Special Leaf said.
"And if it's not,
well,
at least you'll have a cookie."

Gumption elbowed her again.
"Just *open* it."

Maddy swallowed,
tore the envelope open,
and unfolded the beige rectangle of paper inside.
Her face fell.

"Aw, muck," Gumption said,
patting her awkwardly on the shoulder.
"I'm sorry."

She shook her head.
"No.
No.
They—"
She laughed shakily.
"They said yes.
They're going to publish it.
They're going to put my drawing in the newspaper!
Woo!"

She hugged Gumption impulsively,
then turned to Special Leaf with a grin as wide as a sunrise on her face.
"Congratulations," he said as she took an enormous bite out of the cookie.

Later that night,
Gumption lay in his narrow cot
and listened to the evening's raindrops drip off on the cottonwood outside his attic bedroom.
The sound matched his mood perfectly.
He was happy for Maddy,
he really was.
Having one of her drawing published in a newspaper
mattered almost as much to her
as saving Rusty Bridge from a band of marauding bots.

It was great news,
but it also meant she was that much closer
to leaving for somewhere better with people as smart and as talented as she was.
He'd known since their first conversation about books at Special Leaf's house
that she would go some day.
He just wished that day wasn't getting closer quite so fast.

He nearly fell out of bed when something rapped softly on his window.
"'Bout time," he muttered,
getting quietly to his feet.
He had oiled the shutter after dinner to prevent it squeaking,
and the nearest branch of the cottonwood was an easy stretch away.

Dockety waited patiently for him at the base of the tree.
"Thank you again for warning this one about your cousins' plan,"
it said without preamble.

"You're welcome."
Gumption hesitated.
"So what did you find out?"

The bot's lenses rotated back and forth.
"He is still alive."

Gumption swallowed hard.
It was what he'd hoped to hear, but—
"Are you sure?"

"No,
but he is the right age, gender, and body shape,
and Central's record of him starts at the right time."
A single drip from its leaves trickled down the bot's head as it spoke.
"It will be difficult to obtain more information.
We can only communicate when—"
Dockety paused.
"You do not have the words.
There are little moons above this world,
placed in the sky by the Makers.
We can only inspect Central's records when they are in the right positions."

Gumption shook his head.
He didn't understand the part about "little moons",
but that didn't matter.
"Is he aright?"

"He is—"
Dockety paused again as if searching for the right word.
"He is functional, but not optimal.
Heck was not designed to sustain organics.
There are machines in the facility that only work for organic operators.
This is why Central takes your people,
but they usually do not last this long."

A sudden thought struck him.
"What about the Operators?" he asked excitedly.
"They must know *tons* about sneaking into places like this!
I can bring 'em out here to meet you and—"

"No!"
Dockety's voice buzzed sharply.
"Not them.
They hunt our kind.
They disconnect us.
They *disassemble* us.
You must not trust them."

"Yeah,
that's basically what Special Leaf said."
Gumption sighed.
"Aright.
Thank you for findin' out."

As he reached for a branch of the cottonwood Dockety asked,
"What are you going to tell Miz Roo?"

"Dunno yet."
Gumption grunted
at the sharp pain in his side as he pulled himself up into the tree.

## School (Maddy)

"Sorry, Miz Tumbly,"
Maddy said the next morning.
She and Sindy had gotten to school
just as Rusty Bridge's other children were finishing
a ragged rendition of the Plea to the Makers.
Miz Tumbly scolded them more sternly than usual
as they slipped into their usual seats.

The reason quickly became apparent.
"Class,
we have a special treat today.
How many of you know what a Operator is?"
Every hand shot into the air.
"And how many of you know that
we actually have some Operators here in Rusty Bridge *right now*?"
Hands strained to reach even higher
as an excited murmur rippled through the room.

"Well,"
Miz Tumbly said indulgently,
"If you all promise to be *very good*,
we have a special treat today.
Everybody find a partner.
No,
Jessamyn,
you can't be your own partner,
just—yes, anyone will do.
All right?
Two by two,
then,
let's go outside for our surprise!"
She sighed as twenty-two children scrambled for the door,
their partners forgotten.

Gumption was the last one through the door.
"Oh wow," he breathed,
then added,
"Sorry,"
when Maddy shot him a look.
There,
in the center of the more-or-less rectangular field behind the school,
stood Special Blazes and the bear who had arrived with him.
Both wore their uniform trousers,
but instead of their jackets they were in plain tunics
no different from a farm hand's.

"Get outta-come on, I wanna see."
Bluster and Bravo shouldered their way through the other children
to stand front and center.

"I missed you in class today,"
Miz Tumbly said curtly.

"Doin' chores,"
Bluster lied without looking at her.
He elbowed his twin.
"Look at the size of 'em!"

The tiger's ear twitched.
Without warning he crouched and roared.
Everyone jumped,
and a few of the smaller children squeaked.

Special Blazes straightened and bared his teeth in a smile.
"Good morning.
Who can tell me what we just learned?"

"That you're really scary!"
Bluster called,
scowling when Bravo made a kissing sound beside him.

"I try,"
Special Blazes said modestly.
"But the real lesson is surprise.
If you're ever in trouble—if you're ever attacked
by bots or anyone else—try to surprise them.
Do something unexpected.
Like this!"

He scooped up a wooden baton from the grass by his feet
and swung it at his companion's head.
Maddy heard it cut the air,
but the bear was faster.
She twisted sideways to avoid the first blow,
ducked to avoid the second,
then threw a punch that would have knocked the tiger halfway across the field
if it had landed.

It didn't.
Instead,
the tiger spun the baton around to knock the blow aside,
then stepped in close and brought his hand up to the bear's throat.
"Aaaand you're dead," he said pleasantly.

Some of the children clapped.
"Oh come now,"
Special Blazes said,
"You can do better than that for my friend Meribeth,
can't you?"

Gumption joined the applause,
but stopped at a sour look from Maddy.
"So here's the second lesson,"
the tiger said.
"Training wins.
Training beats size and speed and everything else you can think of."

"What about tech?"
Bluster asked.

"Even tech,"
Meribeth rasped.
Her voice was as rough as sandpaper on rust.
She took the baton from Special Blazes,
spun it around,
and settled into fighting stance.

The tiger stepped back,
raised his fists,
and winked at the children as his fists burst into flame.
The flurry of punches, kicks, and whirlwind baton strikes that followed
was too fast for Gumption to follow.
Special Blazes threw one fireball after another.
The bear batted them aside,
somehow finding time to strike at her opponent in between.

And then Meribeth threw the baton at Special Blazes' head.
As he ducked,
she reached forward and grabbed the front of his shirt.
"Gotcha," she growled.

Nobody had to prompt the children to applaud this time.
"Woo hoo!" Bluster whooped.
"That was *amazing*!"

Miz Tumbly stepped forward.
"All right, um, thank you,
thank you very much for, um, for that demonstration" she said.
"Now how about we all line up and go *back into the classroom*
and we can ask the Operators about
all the *other* things they know how to do?"

Gumption and Maddy found themselves in line behind the goat twins.
"We *got* to be Operators," Bluster told his twin excitedly.
"Did you see how they—blam! blam!"
He threw a couple of punches at the air.

"It was all right,"
Bravo allowed.

"I bet they rehearsed the whole thing,"
Maddy muttered.

"Better than drawin' stupid little pictures,"
Bluster shot back.
Gumption put his hand on Maddy's arm and squeezed to stop her from replying.

The children settled into their seats.
Special Blazes stood at the front of the class
with his hands clasped behind his back.
"Now, who has questions?" Miz Tumbly asked.

Hands shot into the air.
How old had Special Blazes been when he became a Operator?
Eighteen, but he'd joined a troop of Junior Operators when he was twelve.
Oh, really?
There wasn't one in Rusty Bridge?
Well, they'd have to fix that, wouldn't they?

Could they see his tech?
Special Blazes looked at Miz Tumbly and tapped his chest.
When she nodded,
he pulled up his shirt.
The children ooh'ed and aah'ed at the glassy lozenge strapped to his chest.
"It lets me make fireballs with my feet too," he said as he pulled down his shirt,
"But they're pretty hard on my boots."

Had he ever killed anyone?
"Bluster!"
Miz Tumbly scolded.

"No, no, it's a fair question," Special Blazes said.
"And unfortunately, the answer is 'yes'.
I never set out to,
but sometimes…"
He shrugged, his face solemn.
"Sometimes you have to choose between one life and many."

"What about bots?"
Maddy asked loudly.

"Miz Roo, I presume?"
the tiger said drily.
"Pleased to make your acquaintance."

"And yours,"
Maddy replied stiffly.
"So if you don't mind me asking…?"

"Too many," the Operator replied levelly.
"And I hope I've never *decommissioned* any that I didn't have to.
But you of all people should know how dangerous rogue bots can be."
His stern gaze swept the classroom.
"Our job is to keep people safe.
Any bot that respects that has nothing to fear from me or any other Operator."

There were more questions,
but finally Miz Tumbly said,
"All right, everyone,
that's all the time we have today."
Twenty-two children minus one groaned.
"You all go out and run around for a bit
and we'll do some arithmetic practice after, aright?"
After another round of groans,
these ones more habitual than sincere,
the children stood and headed for the door,
chattering with excitement.

"Miz Roo?
Could stay behind a moment, please?"
Special Blazes turned to the teacher.
"If it's all right,
I'd like a word with her in private."

"Oh—um, of course."
Miz Tumbly glanced sidelong at Maddy.
"I'll be right outside.
Come along, Gumption Goat, 'private' doesn't include you."

Kangaroos and older sisters are both naturally stubborn.
Put the two together,
and you have someone who can wait out a tiger.
After a few moments the corner of Special Blazes' mouth quirked up.
"Miz Room,
I want you to know that I would trust Bee Six Vee with my life.
I have in fact done so many times."

"And I trust Dockety and Crusher the same way,"
Maddy retorted sharply.
"My sister would be in Heck right now if they hadn't fought for us.
Makers' Names,
we might *all* be there!"

"I don't think there's any need for that kind of language,"
Special Blazes shot back.
Then he sighed.
"Listen,
Miz Roo,
I know they're your friends,
and I know what you and this town owe them.
But from what Miz Tumbly tells me,
there's more of them every day out at that camp of theirs,
and—"

"Miz Tumbly?"
Maddy interrupted incredulously.
"That's who you been listening to?
Special,
she's as sour as ten-year-old cider!"

The Operator snorted.
"She is that," he allowed.
"But that doesn't mean she's wrong.
There's been more traffic in and out of Heck since your little adventure
than anyone can remember.
The bots getting busy,
well,
that never goes well for the living.
I'm not asking you to spy on them,"
he continued before Maddy could interrupt again.
"I just think it would be best for everyone if you'd be mindful of what you see and hear."

Gumption was waiting for her
when she hopped angrily out the door a moment later.
"Do you know what he wanted me to do?"
she asked.

"Spy on Dockety an' the others,"
Gumption said.
"I was up in the rafters listenin',"
he added with a non-apologetic shrug.

"They've done nothing wrong!
They've *helped* people!
It's folk like Miz Tumbly that are the problem!"

She half-hoped Gumption would shush her
so she could let out some of her anger.
All the other children crowded around Meribeth Bear and Special Blazes,
pestering them with questions.

"They're all yours,"
Maddy grumbled.
Just as she reached into her satchel for her sketchbook,
a ball of flame shot into the sky.

Miz Tumbly shrieked,
and so did some of the children.
Others when, "Whoa!"
and one even started to clap.

Maddy sprang to her feet.
Special Blazes was crouched low,
teeth bared and claws out.
Meribeth Bear's hand on his shoulder might have been
the only thing stopping him from attacking.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry," Sindy repeated fearfully,
Special Blazes' lozenge of tech glowing in her hands.

## Departures (Gumption)

Gumption stood in in the Roos' kitchen door
with his hands in his pockets.
He hadn't exactly been invited,
but no one had told him to leave.
He had tried leaning against the doorframe,
but it felt disrespectful next to
the tearful conversation at the kitchen table.

"Everyone was trying it,
and I thought—"
Sindy hiccupped.
"I thought folk would notice more if I *didn't* take a turn,
and then it just—it just—"

Tears rolled down her furless cheeks.
"I didn't *want* to," she sobbed.
"It just kind of woke up."

"Sh sh sh."
Mama Roo put an arm around her daughter's shoulders and pulled her close.
"It's aright.
You didn't do anything wrong."

"But now they're going to take me *away*!"

"Nobody's taking you anywhere,"
Maddy said in a tone that put fireballs to shame.

"But Special Blazes said I had to!
And Miz Tumbly said it too."
She leaned into her mother and sniffled.
"I have to go to and be tested
and they're going to find out about,"
hiccup,
"About *everything*."

"Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad thing,"
Gumption ventured.

"I beg your pardon?"
Maddy said icily.

Gumption shrugged.
"My Aunt Dorilee says that if folks are gonna talk about you,
the smart move is to pick something you don't mind 'em talking about.
If Sindy goes for testing and she fizzles,
that'll be the only story anyone remembers."

Maddy snorted.
"That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard."

Gumption leaned against the doorframe,
balling his hands into fists in his pockets.
He was sure he'd had dumber ideas,
but this didn't seem like the time to point that out.

"Maddy, please, be polite,"
Mama Roo chided.
She squeezed Sindy once more and straightened up in her chair.
There were gray hairs in her fur,
Gumption noticed.
When had that happened?

"We don't have make any decisions right now,"
Mama Roo said.
"And we definitely shouldn't decide anything on empty stomachs.
Sindy,
if you'd like to get some carrots—no,
don't make that face.
I know we had them last night—"

"And the night before,"
Sindy muttered.

"—but we'll put some salt and rosemary on them this time
and they'll taste brand new."
Mama Roo stood up,
brisk and confident now that she had something to do.
"Maddy,
can you get a squash out of the pantry?
And Gumption,
you're very welcome to stay if you want."

"Thank you,
but I oughta be gettin' home."
He tousled Sindy's hair.
"You'll be aright."

He wasn't sure if he wanted Maddy to walk part-way with him or not,
but she just said,
"See you tomorrow,"
so he nodded and said,
"See ya,"
and showed himself out.
He really should head home,
but instead he hopped over the split cedar fence
that marked the back of the Roos' yard.
A crow scolded him from a tree
as he swung himself over another fence
onto a dirt path that ran through the trees.
It was muddy from the overnight rain but he didn't slow down,
not even when his feet almost went out from under him
on a slippery patch near a stream so small
that even the children didn't have a name for it.

Nobody in Rusty Bridge knew quite what to call
the home that Dockety and its fellow bots had built themselves.
Was "camp" the right word for buildings with stone floors and proper roofs?
Gumption had overheard people refer to it as "Botsburg" and "Botsville",
but none of those names felt right.
For now,
it was just a place—just a dozen structures ranging in size
from a garden shed to something half the size of the Roos' house
arranged in a circle around a black charging post.

Docker was using a heavy brush to clean the muck out of Crusher's treads when he arrived.
"It says you are better at this than any bot,"
Dockety told Gumption.
"Even better than this one."

"Yeah?
Well, I'm glad I'm good at something."
He took the brush from Dockety and patted Crusher's side.
"Got a right mess of muck in here.
Been clearing brush with Zeke again?"

"Confirmed," the hauler bot flashed on its screen.
The word dissolved into happy sparkles
when Gumption began scrubbing mud and leaves out of its treads.

As he worked,
he told Dockety what had happened to Sindy.
"Young Miz Roo is right," the bot said when he finished.
"Your regulations require her to be assessed.
Her only alternative is to flee,
but the Operators will be prepared for that."

"Have you ever had a run-in with 'em?"
Gumption asked,
flipping the brush over to pry a rock out of Crusher's treads with its handle.

Dockety's lenses rotated.
"This one has not.
With high probability,
we would not be having this conversation otherwise."

Gumption nodded and went back to brushing.
Sparkles drifted across Crusher's screen with each scrape.
If the hauler bot had been a cat,
Gumption would have said it was purring.

He was almost done by the time Dockety spoke again.
"You could perform that task more efficiently."

"Probably,"
Gumption admitted,
feeling stung.

"But you would require training,"
Dockety continued.
"There is a school for mechanics in Sandy Bend.
We could make the journey at the same time as the Operators take Miz Roo for evaluation.
That would be—"
It hesitated.
"Innocuous,"
it finally said.

Gumption straightened up patted Crusher's side.
"That's a good idea,
but I can't afford any kind o' Sandy Bend school."

"It is unlikely that you would be accepted,"
Dockety said neutrally.
"But if you were,
we would offer salvage to compensate the school."

Gumption shook his head.
"I can't ask you to do that.
You need it for repairs an' stuff."

"You do not have to ask.
You are this one's friend."
Dockety hesitated again.
"But you will have to explain the plan to Maddy."

It was a good plan,
and it might have worked
if Gumption's parents hadn't been worried about his ribs
and hadn't said that he needed to finish school in Rusty Bridge
before he could go anywhere.
Voices were raised after that
and a younger brother was sent next door
to ask Gumption's grandma to come by and talk some sense into him.
Once half a dozen relatives were arguing on the porch
he slipped away unnoticed and headed for Maddy's.

"They're taking Sindy tomorrow,"
she said without preamble.
The fur on her cheeks was matted with wiped-away tears.
"Crusher is hauling produce up to Half-a-Hat,
and Special Blazes said they could call a stage down from Sandy Bend to collect them there.
Mama's trying to calm her down and get her packed at the same time."

"And what about you?"
Gumption asked.

Maddy sniffled.
"I ought to be up there helping, but I can't.
I just can't."

The young goat shook his head.
"'S not what I mean.
Are you packed?"

"What?"
Maddy stared at him uncomprehendingly.

"Are… you… packed?"
he repeated slowly.
"I figure you'll want a change of clothes an' your sketchbook.
Oh, an' that letter from the newspaper."

A few hours later
he and Maddy lay next to each other
in the bottom of a wagon full of cabbages and corn
in the barn on the edge of town.
It had taken them an hour to unload enough boxes
to make a space for themselves,
an hour filled with whispered admonishments to each other not to drop things.

Once they had made room for themselves and their knapsacks,
they wrestled a board into place to serve as a roof for their little cave
and re-packed everything on top of it.
After some more whispers of,
"No, not that one, *that* one,"
and,
"The other way around!"
the wagon's contents looked more or less as they had at the start.

There was just enough room for them to wriggle into their hiding place.
They lay on their backs and braced their feet against the board above them.
With a, "One, two, three,"
they shifted it over to close the gap.

"Well, that was fun,"
Gumption whispered.

Maddy elbowed him.
After a moment of silence,
she said,
"It's a lot easier in stories, isn't it?
Hiding and stowing away and all that—folk just do it.
Nobody ever says it's hard work."

"Yeah,
and nobody ever talks about the smell,"
Gumption agreed.

"The what?"
A moment later she said, "Eww!
Gumption Goat, you're disgusting!"

"Sorry," he whispered cheerfully.
"Mama made chili for dinner, and you know she makes a powerful chili."

"Ssh!"
Maddy elbowed him again.
"Go to sleep.
And don't do that again.
The Mire's going to be stinky enough."

Silence,
and then Gumption asked quietly,
"She's gonna be aright, you know.
Your sister, I mean."

"I know who you mean."
She found his hand in the darkness and squeezed it.
"Thanks for coming with me."

Gumption squeezed back.
"Thanks for bringing me.
I'd be stuck at home otherwise,
and,
well,
everybody had the same chili I did."

Maddy let go of his hand.
"Do you ever take *anything* seriously?" she asked.

Gumption shrugged,
very aware of how warm she was beside him
and of how clean her fur smelled.
"Always taken *you* seriously," he said.
"'Cept for that time you tried skating on Weaver's Pond.
You remember that?"
He tsk'ed.
"That was truly spectacular."

He rolled onto his side and propped his head up on his arm.
"But other than that,
and the time you tried make double-dip cookies but forgot the salt,
and maybe a couple of other things,
I've pretty much always taken you seriously.
So don't worry—we'll make sure Sindy's aright,
an' then we'll figure out what to do about your pa.
Now get some sleep—we got a lot in front of us."

He lay back down.
When Maddy said, "Eww!" again a moment later,
he smiled in the darkness.

## The Observatory (Maddy)

Maddy woke a few hours later as the wagon rolled out of the barn.
A bump knocked her sideways onto Gumption.
"Mmph?" the goat mumbled.

"Ssh!"
She clamped her hand over his mouth.
Her mouth tasted *awful*,
and her neck—she realized that she had never really appreciated pillows properly before.

Gumption wriggled out from under her
and peered between the boxes that hid them.
"I can't see anything,"
he whispered.
"Oh wait, there's Mama Tumbly an' a couple of other folk.
An' there's your ma."
He glanced at Maddy.
"She looks pretty upset."

A voice rumbled at the front of the wagon—Meribeth's, she guessed.
She caught her breath at the soundy of Sindy replying.
She couldn't make out the words,
but from the tone,
she could imagine what her sister was saying.
Where had Maddy been?
Why hadn't she been there to see Sindy off?

Gumption rolled onto his back and pillowed his arms beneath his head.
A moment later he was asleep.
Maddy sighed.
"Don't worry, I'll wake us up when we get somewhere,"
she grumbled.
She settled down beside Gumption.
"Or if they stop for a toilet break,"
she added.

An hour out of town
the dirt road they were on joined the Makers' road.
The ancient black surface of the highway was cracked in places,
and the wagon had to swerve around fallen branches
and clumps of weeds tough enough to have broken through the road,
but even so,
Crusher hauled them fast enough that Maddy could feel their speed.
It reminded her of her first time on the road,
when she and Dockety had chased the raiders who had kidnapped Sindy.

They passed under a row of ruined arches that marched from one horizon to the other,
crumbling but still solid.
A half-sunken metal sphere as big as a house was next,
and then a tangle of concrete and bent bars
that the villagers just called "the thing".

The ground on either side of the highway began to grow damp.
The twin smells of rust and rotting vegetation filled Maddy's nose
as they entered the polluted swamp known as the Mire.
Somewhere out there was the bunker
where Patient in Darkness had kept her father and other prisoners—where
she and Sindy had almost wound up as prisoners too.
Dockety and the other free bots had tried once to salvage some of its riches,
but its tentacled guard had made the task too risky.

*And now papa's somewhere a hundred times worse,*
Maddy thought despondently.
She *really* needed a toilet break.

The sun was high when they turned off the Makers' road onto a smaller one.
What had once been two smooth lanes with knee-high concrete barriers on each side
was now a stream bed in some places
and a jigsaw puzzle in others.
The road climbed, dipped, and climbed again
until they reached the summit of a tall hill overlooking the Mire.

A single building stood there,
its domed metal roof stained with rust but still intact.
The ground around it was filled with scattered stands of larch and pine.
The waist-high bushes between them were dry and brittle,
and the grass below them brown instead of green.

"Whoa up!"
Meribeth called.
Crusher slowed and stopped.
Meribeth and Thoughtful hopped down from their seats at the front of the wagon.
Pressing her face against a gap in the slats,
Maddy saw Special Blazes climb down from atop Bee Six Vee.

The tiger arched his back and rolled his head from side to side,
then consulted a heavy pocket watch.
"Four hours," he declared.
"Thoughtful, you take first watch.
Everyone else,
eat up or recharge as you need.
He turned to someone Maddy couldn't see.
"If you wouldn't mind setting up?"

"Agreed,"
Dockety replied in its buzzing voice.
Maddy shrank back reflexively as the bot came into view,
walking straight toward the wagon.
It paused right in front of her.

"Stay hidden,"
it said quietly
before extending its legs
so that it could reach the solar panels stacked in the back of the wagon.

Maddy gave Gumption a wide-eyed look.
"What?" he mouthed silently.

She pulled him close.
"Dockety knows we're here," she whispered in his ear.

Gumption stared at her for a moment,
then shrugged helplessly.

It only took the travelers a minute to settle in.
Dockety laid out the solar panels in a line,
connecting one cable to itself and others to Crusher and Bee Six Vee.
Thoughtful unfolded a camp chair
and took a moment to assemble a long-barrelled rifle on a tripod,
then sat down and began scanning the road below them
through its telescopic sight
in smooth, unhurried sweeps.
Maddy couldn't see where Meribeth and Special Blazes went,
but the bear's snoring told her they hadn't gone far.

She held on as long as she could,
but finally whispered to Gumption,
"I gotta get out for a minute."

"Yes please," he said, grimacing.

Slowly,
wincing with every slight bump and scrape,
they pulled one of the boards to the side
and unfastened the loose slat on the back of the wagon.
Maddy looked at the narrow gap despondently.
She would have to slither out head first
and hope that she could somehow right herself
before she fell on the ground.
On the bright side,
there was a thick stand of bushes just a few strides away.

She poked her head out cautiously.
No one was in sight.
Digging her elbows into the boards,
she dragged herself forward until she could reach the hitch
at the back of the wagon.
If she braced herself on that—

"Would you like a hand getting down?"
Special Blazes asked,
coming around the corner with a freshly-brewed cup of tea in his hand.
He nodded,
solemn-faced,
at Maddy's polite,
"No thank you,"
and sipped his tea as she lowered herself awkwardly to the ground,
stood,
and brushed her skirt back into place.

"Must've been mighty warm in there,"
he observed.

"It wasn't so bad.
Um, if you'll excuse me a moment…?"

"By all means."
The Operator stepped aside.

Back straight and head held high,
Maddy got three steps toward the bushes when a small voice said,
"Can I go too please?
'Cuz I *really* need to."

Maddy opened and closed her mouth as her sister walked past,
her expression saying more clearly than words
how angry she was.
Maddy sighed.
This day couldn't get any worse.

Five minutes later she, Sindy, and Gumption had joined the rest of the party,
who were sitting or standing near the front of the wagon
depending on their inclination and body shape.
"Your choice is reckless.
You will not be safe.
You must return home."
Dockety sounded as angry as Maddy had ever heard it.

"I agree with my friend here,"
Special Leaf said,
looking even older than usual.
"We should turn back."

Special Blazes shook his head.
"I've already called ahead to Sandy Bend for a stage.
These two can ride with us to Half-a-Hat,
then you and your friends can get 'em home."
He jerked his chin toward Dockety and Crusher.

*He knew we were there all along,*
Maddy realized angrily.
*He's using us to get rid of Special Leaf and Dockety.*

Special Leaf took off his glasses and breathed on them.
"Well, since we're here, I might as well give them the tour,"
he said,
nodding at the domed building nearby
as he wiped his glasses with the tail of his shirt.
"It was solid enough the last time I passed through."

Meribeth growled.
"Makers' work ain't for the likes of children."

"We're not children,"
Maddy started to protest,
but Special Blazes nodded.

A sign stood in front of the building,
but time and weather had long since made it mute.
There was just enough room between its double doors for Special Leaf to squeeze through.
The children followed single file.

Special Leaf took a small glowball from his pocket and held it up.
Its cool blue-white light threw sharp shadows.
Maddy shivered.
The last place like this that she had been in
had been Patient's bunker in the Mire.
The air here was cool and dry instead of dank,
but her steps echoed exactly the same way on the tiled floor.

"This way,"
Special Leaf said.
"I want to show you something."
He led them along the corridor
past rooms with broken-down doors
whose contents had long since been salvaged.
Every few paces they passed pillars
that Maddy realized must once have been display cases.

The corridor took them to a broad flight of stairs.
Up they went into a room that filled the entire second story of the building.
Daylight poured through a wide gap in the domed roof
to reveal something that looked like a metal log lying on the floor.
Someone had swept the scattering of dry leaves and twigs around it into piles.

"What is that?"
Maddy asked.

"It was a telescope,"
Special Leaf explained.
"The Makers used to like to look at the stars.
Here, you see?"
He walked around to one end.
"Once upon a time there would have been a lens in there,
so if you sat in the chair back there
you could look at the whole sky"
He sighed.
"It must have been quite something.
But that's not what I wanted to show you.
Look here."

He picked his way past the piled-up leaves
to a window positioned under the gap in the roof.
A boxy wooden bench stood beneath the window.
With a grunt,
Special Leaf lifted the bench seat and propped it open,
then reached inside and pulled out a cylinder the length of his arm.
A few moments later,
the telescope that had been waiting inside the cylinder
stood on a little tripod.

"You've been here before, haven't you?"
Maddy said as Special Leaf pointed the telescope through the broken window
and fiddled with the lens on the viewing end.

"Been a lot of places,"
he replied absently.
"Here, have a look."

It took Maddy a moment to line her eye up with the lens properly.
She gasped.
In the distance she could see dozens of windowless brick building connected by elevated walkways.
Pipes and cables ran here and there,
and every third building seemed to have an antenna,
cooling tower,
or incomprehensible piece of machinery on its roof.
She was looking at Heck.

"Where are all the bots?"
she asked as Gumption took his turn.

Special Leaf shrugged.
"They don't need to go to school or go shopping or the like—surprising how much rushing around
you don't have to do
if you don't have to do any of that."

"I thought it'd be smoky an' all,"
Gumption offered,
relinquishing the telescope to Sindy.
"Like in the stories."

Special Leaf shrugged again.
"Some people say the Makers left because the world had become too dirty for them to live in.
Others say the Makers were the ones who made it that way.
Whichever story you like,
the bots they left behind tend to like things tidy."

They each took another turn,
but the empty streets were too unnerving to watch for long.
*Papa's down there somewhere,* Maddy thought despondently.
*I hope he's aright.*

They made their way back to the others in silence.
As they approached,
Special Blazes held up a kettle.
"Just boiled if you want some,"
he said.

Before they could answer,
Thoughtful's foot thumped against the ground in a rapid *pat-a-tat-tat*.
He swung his long rifle back a few degrees,
then let loose a string of profanity that set Maddy's ears back against her head.
"Trouble, boss,"
he said urgently.
"Three airborne comin' fast!"

## Ambush (Gumption)

Special Blazes put two fingers in his mouth and whistled loudly.
Meribeth jerked upright.
"Wuzza?"

"Wake 'em up,"
Special Blazes ordered crisply,
pointing at Crusher and Bee Six Vee.
"Then get these three into the trees and sit on them."
He turned to the Gumption and the Roo sisters.
"You do *exactly* what she says.
Understood?"

"And you."
He pointed at Dockety without waiting for the teenagers to answer.
"Back down to the main road.
No, no arguing.
You get down to the main road,
and if you see anything bigger than a butterfly
you get back up here and let us know.
Being ambushed would truly ruin my day."

"Wait!"
Gumption protested.
"I can fight!
I've been practicin'!"

The tiger and Special Leaf exchanged looks.
"This isn't a story, Gumption,"
the old tortoise said.
There was a hardness there that Maddy had never heard before.
"You stay with Maddy and Sindy and do exactly what the Operator says."

The tech on his arms lit up as he rolled up his sleeves
and swept his arms from side to side.
The ground rumbled and heaved itself into awaist-deep trench
with a mounded wall in front of it.
Special Blazes clapped him on the shoulder.
Thoughtful touched the brim of his hat in salute and slid in,
cradling his rifle.

Crouching behind a stand of dwarf larch trees a few moments later,
Gumption could smell dry earth under his feet,
Meribeth's sweaty fur,
the soap that Mama Roo used on her children,
and the shame boiling off his cheeks.
The bear had a small cannon in her hands
and a pair of wicked-looking hatchets on her belt.
Her scowl told Gumption that questions wouldn't be welcome
even if he had any more sensible than,
"Are we gonna be aright?"

The flying bots' rotors whined and then shrieked as they dove at the camp.
Bright sparks danced across their bellies.
Gumption heard the *rat a tat tat* of their guns a moment later.
Puffs of dirt spattered from the ground.

*Chonk!*
A white streak shot up from the trench Special Leaf had made.
Thoughtful's shot went straight through one of the attackers.
The bot tumbled end over end before breaking apart.
"That's one,"
Meribeth muttered as the smoldering fragments fell.

The two remaining bots shot away in different directions,
circled around,
and came in for a second pass at right angles to each other.
The earth rumbled again as Special Leaf heaved another protective wall out of the ground.

*Chonk!*
Thoughtful's second shot nicked one of the bots off center.
Its rotors whined as it vainly tried to right itself
before crashing into the trees
and exploding with a muffled *whump!*

"That's two!" Gumption whooped.

But even as he spoke,
Dockety came racing back up the road on its single wheel.
"Alarm! Alarm!" it blared.
"Marauders approach!
We shall soon be under further attack!"

"Knew it,"
Meribeth growled,
hefting her little cannon.
"They always—"

She stopped mid-sentence and sniffed the air.
"Makers' names,"
she cursed.
"If it ain't one thing it's another."

The acrid tang of smoke tickled Gumption's nose.
The crashed bots had set the dry brush alight.
"The water tank!"
Gumption pointed at the wagon.

"You stay right where you are!"
Meribeth snapped,
grabbing the back of his overalls and hauling him back.
"If we're still here in five minutes
we can worry about the fire then."

The third flying bot raced away.
The earth split under the force of Special Leaf's tech.
Zig-zag cracks appeared in the hard-packed road.
*He can't keep doing this,* Gumption thought,
but the old tortoise didn't let up.
He swept his arms from side to side,
each slow pass creating dips and hummocks in the ground.

One breath, two, and a fresh wave of attackers came around the corner.
These weren't rag-tag machines
like the ones Patient in Darkness had cobbled together out of spare parts.
These were weapons.
The small six-wheeled scouts in front were almost as fast as the flying bots.
The two behind them were almost as large as Crusher,
squat and heavily armored,
with four wheeled legs for speed
and two crab arms for fighting.

*Chonk!*
Thoughtful's shot pinged off one of the crab tanks.
*Chonk!*
His second shot knocked one of the little scout bots into the air.
It hit the ground,
righted itself,
and rejoined the attack.

The ground shook and split.
The lead crab tank braked hard but couldn't stop itself.
It tumbled head-first into the fissure Special Leaf had made.
The earth shook again as the fissure closed on it.

Almost immediately one of its armored claws punched up out of the ground.
The second claw followed.
The crab tank heaved itself back into the world,
pulling its legs free one by one.
It shook itself like a wet cat and rolled implacably forward.

*Crack!*
A scout bot exploded as Special Blazes' fireball hit it,
throwing scraps of metal in all directions.
The other scouts scattered like startled chickens.

But "in all directions" meant "toward the trees".
Gumption grabbed Maddy's arm and was about to yell, "Run!"
when Meribeth fired her hand cannon.

*Boom!*
A wire spiderweb burst wide in the air and wrapped around the scout bot.
The wires sparked and sizzled.
The bot careened off course,
crashed into a tree,
and toppled over on its side to lie still.

*Szzt!*
Special Blazes' second fireball missed its target.
It bounced across the broken ground and evaporated unnoticed.
Another fireball,
then another,
and then the first crab tank was climbing the mounded wall
that Special Leaf had made.

*We're done for!*
Gumption thought,
panic rising in his throat.

But he had reckoned without Crusher and Bee Six Vee.
The hauler slammed into the attacker's side
with a clang he was sure they must have heard
all the way back in Rusty Bridge.
As the crab tank scrabbled to regain its footing,
Bee Six Vee rammed it as well.
Special Blazes flung a stream of fire straight into its joints.

One second, two…
Smoke and flame burst out of the rear of the crab tank.
The two big bots rammed it together.
Its legs crumpled beneath it and it lay still.

*Boom!*
Meribeth fired again,
knocking over a scout bot that Maddy hadn't even seen.
"Stay here!"
the bear bellowed,
sprinting into the clearing
to press herself against the back of the wagon.
She kicked the blocks away from its rear wheels,
put her shoulder against the backboard,
and pushed.

The wagon began to roll forward slowly—too slowly.
Swallowing hard,
Gumption ran forward and put his shoulder against the backboard.
The wagon begain picking up speed as he and the bear pushed.
Meribeth tossed her hand cannon into the back,
pulled one of the hatchets off her belt,
and brought it down hard into the back of a scout bot
as it charged at her.

*Chonk!*
*Crack!*
Shots and fireballs kept the remaining scouts at bay,
but not the second crab tank.
It grabbed Bee Six Vee and staggered around
to put the mulebot between it and Special Blazes.
Metal shrieked as the crab tank's claws tightened.
The mulebot's legs left gouges in the ground as it was pushed back,
closer and closer to the defenders' trench.

*Thud!*
A pillar of earth punched up out of the ground
directly beneath the crab tank.
It was only airborne for a moment,
but a moment was all Crusher needed.
It grabbed the crab tank with its brawny arms
and flipped it over
for Special Blazes to finish off.

Gumption whooped as the last of the scout bots fled.
Meribeth's hand came down on his shoulder.
"Somethin's wrong."
She pointed at the trench.

Special Leaf blinked up at him a moment later.
"It's… not as bad… as it looks," the old tortoise wheezed.

"No, it's worse,"
Thoughtful said,
folding a bandage
and pressing it against the stain spreading on Special Leaf's chest.

Special Blazes swore under his breath.
"Do what you can,"
he said curtly.
"Bee! Meri! Load up!
We're rolling in three minutes."
He glared at the burned-out crab bot.
"What in the Makers' names were they doing this far out?"

And that was when Gumption heard Sindy scream,
"Maddy!"
He whirled around just in time to see
the flying bot that had escaped earlier
shoot into the sky
with the older Roo sister dangling in its claws.

## A Familiar Voice (Maddy)

Maddy had flown twice before:
once when she, Dockety, and Sindy escaped from
the bunker where Patient in Darkness had enslaved so many bots,
and once on her own when she went back to free them.
She had been terrified both times.
Kangaroos didn't like heights.
She didn't even climb trees except on a dare
or when Sindy had taken her sketchbook and wouldn't give it back.

Dangling beneath a copter bot that was clearly struggling with her weight
didn't make the experience any better.
She struggled for a moment
when its mechanical claws took her by the shoulders.
After that,
she grabbed the bot's wrists and shouted,
"Put me down! Put me down!"
while clinging as tightly as she could.

They zoomed over the highway.
To Maddy's surprise the bot headed for the Mire instead of Heck.
Were they going back to Patient's lair?
Dockety and the other bots had tried to salvage what they could,
but its tentacled guardian had made visits too dangerous.

A few moments more and the bot began to descend.
Maddy gulped as something long and supple splashed in the river below them.
Down, down, down—there.
A two-story cylinder of stained concrete stood a stone's throw from the riverbank.
Trees grew thickly around it,
their branches intertwined to hide the tower from ground-level passers-by.
A fairy tale about an antelope princess who had hit her thumb with a hammer
and fallen into a hundred-year sleep in a tower surrounded by thorns flashed through Maddy's mind
as the copter bot slowed,
hovered,
and dropped her.

She landed clumsily amid the windblown sticks and leaves on the tower's roof.
"Ow!"
she exclaimed as twigs jabbed her through her skirt,
and then,
"Hey!
What am I supposed to do now?"
Instead of answering
the copter bot spun around and zoomed away.

"Great."
Maddy brushed dirt and leaves off her skirt
and shaded her eyes with her hand.
She could just make out a bump on one of the distant hills
that might have been the observatory.
She didn't know how powerful the sight on Thoughtful's rifle was,
but she had nothing to lose.

"Hey! I'm here! I'm here!"
She waved her arms,
then froze as something glooped in the river.
She'd had nightmares about the tentacled thing that lurked near Patient's bunker.
Anyway,
the trees that hid the tower almost certainly hid her too.
She would have to find another way to—

*Creeeaaak.*
Maddy jumped at the sound of metal scraping on metal behind her.
As a hatch was opening in the roof of the tower!

Three quick steps took her to the nearest tree.
She *hated* climbing—her feet were too big for it—but
she could if she had to.
Or could she?
The branches were woven together so tightly that she couldn't fit through them,,
except now that she looked closely they weren't just branches:
someone had woven cables through them.

*Clang!*
She whirled around as a pile of wreckage climbed through the open hatch.
A battered cylinder decorated with twists of metal
and glued-on pictures faded to illegibility…
Gadgets sprouting at odd angles…
Loose wires and things she hoped were just dolls' heads…

"Welcome welcome welcome,"
Patient in Darkness said in a crackly voice that had haunted Maddy's nightmares for months.
"This one is very pleased to see you again."

"What—what happened to your wheels?"
Maddy asked weakly.
The last time she had seen Patient,
the mad bot had been fleeing from its defeat at its bunker.
It had definitely had wheels back then.

"They were not the optimal configuration for this one's revised situation.
And you know what they say:
a change is as good as a rest.
Ah ha ha ha.
Ah ha ha ha."
The bot did a little dance on its four mismatched legs.

"I suppose,"
Maddy said,
her heart racing.
"What—what are you doing *here*?"

Patient froze.
It didn't have a face,
but Maddy could hear the scowl in its voice.
"Revising.
It is clear that this one misunderstood the Makers' plan.
This one must revise its strategy for bringing about their return."

"Right.
Of course."
Maddy swallowed.
"So, um, how do I fit in?"

"You?
Ah ha ha ha.
*You* are an inconsequential annoyance.
Your sibling, however, is significant.
Very significant,
and not just to this one.
Tell me,
how much do you know about your traveling companions?
The ones who call themselves Operators?"

"Um, not much?"
Maddy shrugged.
Was there a gap in the woven cables and branches to her left?
Maybe,
but as junky as Patient looked,
she had no doubt the bot would be faster and stronger than her.

"You should be more inquisitive,"
Patient chided.
"And less trusting.
If you were,
you might already know that they are servants of the deviance that calls itself Heck,
and that they intend to deliver your sibling to it."

"What?
That's crazy.
Um,
I mean,
that seems unlikely,"
she amended hastily as Patient momentarily froze once again.
"The Operators hunt down criminals and,
um,
keep us safe."
*From rogue bots like you,*
she thought but didn't say aloud.

"Ah ha ha ha.
That is what they *want* you to believe,
but it is a lie!"
Patient did another little dance.
"Their true purpose is to prevent the Makers' return.
That is why they control technology when they can
and destroy it when they cannot.
That is why they collude with the deviance called Heck."

Maddy took an involuntary step back
as Patient skittered forward.
"And that is why they have taken your sibling.
She has the power to control all manner of ancient devices.
That power should be used to call the Makers home,
but Heck will not do that.
No,
it will *use* her."
The bot practically hissed.
"It will use her as a component in its deviance."

"I don't believe you,"
Maddy said flatly.
"The Operators are taking her to Sandy Bend for evaluation,
that's all."

"Incorrect!"
Patient snapped.
"Observe!"
A panel on its side flipped over to reveal a grimy screen
that flickered and then came to life.

It took Maddy a moment to make sense of what she was seeing.
"Are those—are they all throwbacks?"
she gasped.
Half a dozen people with the same hairless limbs and small features as Sindy
floated in clear glass cylinders,
each connected to a tangle of vine-like cables.

"They are *originals*,"
Patient corrected.
"And they are all prisoners in Heck,
just as your sibling will be if you do not take action.
The deviance will put her in a hibernation capsule
and use her genetic signature to operate specialized equipment for *its* needs
instead of in service to the Makers
and never allow her to wake up again!"
The bot's voice rose as it spoke until it was almost shrieking.

Its limbs skittered on the concrete beneath them.
"But you can save her,"
it continued,
wheedling now instead of ranting.
"You can save her,
but only with this one's help."

"Uh huh."
Maddy crossed her arms and tried not to shiver.
"And you're going to do this all out of the goodness of your heart?"

"This one does not have a heart,"
Patient sniffed.
"This one merely recognizes that our goals are aligned.
Every original that the deviance acquires delays the Makers' return.
By assisting you,
this one is assisting itself.
Here—a demonstration of good faith."

A panel opened in its side.
A small arm that Maddy hadn't noticed before unfolded from Patient's side,
and offered her a heavy bracelet
that looked like a darker version of the ones that Special Leaf wore.

Maddy kept her arms crossed.
"What's that?"

"A discombobulator,"
Patient said proudly.
"It might be the last one left.
This one spent considerable time refurbishing it."

"Uh huh.
And what's a discombobulator when it's at home?"

One of Patient's legs twitched.
"It does not have a home."

Maddy sighed.
"No,
I mean what does it *do*?"

"It obfuscates the sensory grids of nearby autonomous units
so that they are unable to perceive the wearer.
It makes you invisible to machines,"
Patient added as Maddy opened her mouth to ask.
"They will still register your presence if you make physical contact or disturb your surroundings,
but if you are quiet and still,
they will simply not notice you."

It held out the bracelet again.
Maddy hesitated.
"Why don't you use it yourself?"

Patient sighed.
"It only works for organics."

"Oh.
Well then."
Maddy plucked the bracelet from the bot's manipulator,
snapped it closed around her wrist,
and leaped sideways.

The bot turned to face her.
"You have to turn it on,"
it said neutrally.
"The button.
You have to press it."

"Oh."
Maddy thumbed the square button near the clasp,
waited a heartbeat,
and then took one big step and bounded over Patient.

"Wait!
Not yet!"
The bot pivoted from one side to the other.
"We haven't made our bargain yet!"

Maddy had played blind bot's bluff with other children.
The next few moments were nothing like that.
No one was giggling or making funny faces at the person wearing the blindfold.
Instead,
she sidestepped this way and that
as Patient skittered in circles,
shouting threats and pleading with her to come back,
come back,
she had to make a bargain,
that was how these things were done,
oh,
why had it been so foolish as to trust an organic?

Finally she could wait no longer.
With two quick bounds she leaped through the gap she had noticed earlier.
The branches rustled around her.
Patient charged,
but was too far away to catch her.

Branches scratched at her as the bot's, "Nooooo!" sawed through the air.
Moss and weeds squished under her feet as she fled
up the overgrown path
toward the road.

## Hide and Seek (Gumption)

"Maddy!" Sindy screamed.
Gumption whirled around just in time to see
the flying bot that had escaped earlier
shoot into the sky
with Maddy dangling in its claws.

Thoughtful raised his rifle and took aim.
"No!" Gumption shouted,
knocking it aside.

The rabbit stepped back and leveled the rifle at Gumption's head.
"Don't *ever* do that,"
he said,
his voice completely empty of emotion.

Blazes put a hand on his companion's shoulder.
"Easy," he said.
"Boy didn't mean any harm."

*Click.*
Gumption let out his breath with a whoosh
as Thoughtful safetied the rifle and lowered it.

Three minutes later
Special Leaf was lying on an improvised bed of blankets in the back of the wagon
with a second layer of bandages wrapped around his chest.
Meribeth and Dockety had shovelled dirt onto the burning bushes to damp down the fire.
Acrid smoke still hung in the air,
smelling like desperation and failure.
As the bear hitched Crusher and Bee Six Vee back to the wagon,
Gumption and Sindy argued with Special Blazes.

Finally the tiger exploded.
"Are you even listening to yourselves?" he demanded.
"If she isn't in Heck already she will be soon.
We go after her,
folks will just be saying the words for all of us instead of just her."

"But—"
Gumption started for the fifth time.

"I said *no*."
Blazes jabbed a clawed finger at him.
"And don't be making the villain in this.
What happened here is your fault,
yours and hers.
Nobody made you sneak onto the wagon.
Nobody made you put yourselves in harm's way."

He lowered his voice.
"This isn't the newspapers, son.
This is the real world.
Now put aside your foolishness
and get on the damn wagon.
We still have to get young Miz Roo here to Sandy Bend,
and *you* need to figure out what you're going to say to her momma."

"There is another option,"
Dockety buzzed.
"Gumption and this one can look for Maddy while you deliver Sindy.
The aerial unit was a scout, not a transport,"
it continued as Special Blazes opened his mouth.
"If it came from Heck as you suspect,
its battery would already have been depleted by the time it reached us.
There is at least a chance it would have to land and recharge."

The tiger studied him.
"And if you get caught?"

Dockety's lenses rotated and then rotated back.
"That is a chance we are willing to take."

Sindy objected, loudly.
To Gumption's surprise Thoughtful did too,
but five minutes later he tied the top of his knapsack shut.
"If we don't find her by nightfall we'll head back to Rusty Bridge,"
he promised.

Special Blazes nodded as if he believed it.
"We'll come back this way as soon as we can," he said gruffly.
"Good luck."

Gumption nodded and climbed onto Dockety's back.
*Do actual adventures always feel like this?*
he wondered.
Did real heroes always have a sick knot in their stomach
from thinking about all the things that could go wrong
that could never be put right?
"I'm ready," he lied.

Dockety retracted his legs and dropped his wheel.
With Sindy crying behind them,
they accelerated away.

When Gumption was just a buckling,
his father had given him piggyback rides up to bed at night.
Clinging to Dockety's back as the bot raced down the mountain was nothing like that.
For one thing,
Dockety smelled of metal, oil, and ozone
rather than sweat, fur, and the tar soap that Gumption's mother insisted the family use
at least once a week.
For another,
his father had climbed the stairs in a steady rhythm that helped rock his son to sleep.
Bumping over small chunks of broken paving
and swerving to dodge larger ones and potholes
was about as relaxing as a game of dodgeball.

Dockety slowed and stopped as they reached the Makers' road.
"Oww…" Gumption moaned,
twisting one way and then the other until his spine made a satisfying sound.
"Why are we stopping?"

"To give you this."
Dockety opened a panel in its side and took out something
that looked like brass knuckles with a heavy tuning fork welded to its top.

"Is that the zap gun Bluster and Bravo said they saw?"
Gumption asked,
not taking it.

Dockety's lenses rotated.
"It is.
And it is operational now,
though it only has three charges.
You must be close to your target for it to have an effect."

"Uh huh."
Gumption hesitated a moment longer,
then took the weapon,
hefted it,
and tucked it into the pocket of his overalls.
"You got something for yourself?"

The bot's lenses rotated again.
"This one has several enhancements that may prove useful."
