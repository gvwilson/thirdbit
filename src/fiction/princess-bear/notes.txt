## Theme

* The story's genesis was a question: if intelligent animals are treated like people, how will society view mentally challenged people?
  * If the answer is "they should be treated like other people", then why aren't ungifted animals treated with respect?
* Separately, the Blight is a metaphor for the consequences of dumping toxic waste

## People

* The Cloudherds
  * Noxy (Probably Noxious): heroine, 14
    * can speak with clouds better than anyone
    * but just wants to be normal: her father paid the price of magic, her mother paid the personal cost of being reeve
  * Cloak: a young cloud
* Gandan-o
  * Prince Thokmay: hero, also 14
    * gave up the right to rule to save Marandine, now trying to figure out who he is
    * his father was always working, always critical of small things, so Thokmay gave up trying to connect
    * Thokmay cares for his sister Ogmin in part to give himself a purpose
    * eventually realizes that the world needs saving (the Blight) and that the only way to do that is to help people (his father)
  * Prince Jokmin: his younger brother, now his family's heir and candidate for the throne
  * Princess Ogmin: Thokmay and Jokmin's sister
    * simple-minded ("ungifted")
  * Sergeant Gyalpa: heads the troop of soldiers
  * Sergeant Ramdu: magician (traitor)
  * Manpa and Jinpa: soldiers
* Changan-o
  * Consul Yisu: Changan's official representative (outgoing)
  * Consul Nangyal: the villain
* Locals
  * Master Bortja: head of the merchants' association, suspected of villainy, but not
  * Muddh: Ramdu's brother, the main villain of the piece
  * Jokhang: a baker (incidental)
  * Badam the Dog: the ghost of the last dog
    * killed by plague two generations ago
* Gifted
  * Mope: Gifted troll (mention early that the Bantangui call them "orangutans")
  * Dolly: his Gifted mother
  * Rust: a bear
  * two raccoons
  * a crow

## Things to Fix

* Build up the prejudice against the Gifted a lot more
  * Scenes in the market
  * Expand the dinner scene
    * Bortja and others hide their prejudice toward Ormin
    * But most Bridgers don't
  * Noxy's own unthinking acceptance of discrimination is challenged
    * She refers to Mope as a troll
    * "We prefer 'orangutan', unless of course you're a gorilla or a chimpanzee - I believe you'd call them ogres and goblins"
  * Mope's initial dislike of Noxy manifests as intellectual one-upmanship
    * Dolly eventually calms him down: "You don't win a fight by making more enemies..."
    * Mope: "Why do _we_ always have to be the ones to forgive _them_?"
    * Dolly: "Because they have power and we don't"
* Make the minor characters slight caricatures
  * Exaggerate their features a bit to appeal to younger audience
  * Noxy, Thokmay, and Ogmin are fully rounded
  * Ramdu is cold (but in the end we feel sorry for her)
* Introduce Bortja earlier, make him more of a villain
  * A merchant on his way up
  * Rust is a hireling
  * Why does Bortja need Rust??
* Remove Piqaluujaq and anything more than passing mentions of the Anuat
  * Important for the next story, but irrelevant to this one
* Noxy is afraid of her ability to speak to clouds so well because of seeing her father pay the price for magic
  * Mope or Dolly asks her to speak to the tornado - "It only works with clouds"
  * But then under pressure she gets through to it and commands it
  * Need to foreshadow this - she gets premonitions, which she only realizes in the end are whispers of thought from the tornado
  * The premonitions make her think she's developing magical talent, which scares her
* Noxy's premonitions make some of the soldiers think she's in league with the smugglers
  * So they don't trust her when the tornado is about to descend on Apple Bridge
* Noxy grows up a bit
  * At the start, she gives orders to her cloud (as she's been trained to: be firm)
  * Later, when the tornado hits Apple Bridge, she asks it for help
  * Experience with the treatment of the Gifted makes her realize that she shouldn't command

----------------------------------------

Suddenly Noxy gasped. "There!" she pointed. "Left of those trees,
on the other side of that beanfield. Is that the tornado?"

The prince shielded his eyes with his hand and squinted, then relaxed
again. "No, that's just Farmer Mark's upside-down pond."

Noxy blinked. "What do you mean, 'upside-down'?"

"The pond," the prince explained. "There's something Blighted buried
underneath it. Every once in a while it rains in reverse---the water
comes up out of the pond, instead of falling into it. Sergeant Gyalpa
says that one of the magicians who was in Apple Bridge years ago
wanted to drain the pond and dig the magic up, but Farmer Mark's
father told him that it wasn't hurting anyone, and made good rainbows,
so they left it alone."

"That's spooky," Noxy said, stroking the cloud absent-mindedly.

The prince nodded. "Yes, but at least it's harmless. Most of what's in
the Blight is a lot worse. You can see the ground churning sometimes,
like it was the ocean on a stormy day. Sergeant Gyalpa says that the
wrong puff of wind can turn you into glass."

Noxy shivered. "Have you ever gone there yourself?" she asked.

"Only the edges," the prince confessed. "But Sergeant Gyalpa and Manpa
went half-way to Fast Lake once. He says they were only gone six days,
but it seemed like almost four months to them." He glanced up as a
startled nutfinch flew past them, then looked back at Noxy.

"It's because of the magic," he said, in answer to the question on her
face. "The Pilots wanted the stuff they threw away to get old and rot
away quickly, so they put a spell on the lake that makes time go
faster there. But now that they're gone, all kinds of stuff is leaking
out and washing down the Trout."

"Stuff like the tornado?" Noxy asked. The other cloudherds had
actually told her about Fast Lake even before they'd left Marandine,
but Prince Thokmay seemed to want to explain it.

"Sometimes," he said, "But stuff like that is mostly brought out by
smugglers. Most of what's washed down is just...ugly. The trees near
the river are all twisted, and sometimes the people and animals too."

Noxy looked at the green forest beneath them. Each hill rose a
little less high than the one before it as the land dropped down into
the valley of the Trout. Even as she watched, a doe and a stilt-legged
fawn that couldn't have been more than a couple of months old trotted
across a grassy gap in the trees and disappeared again. "So why do
people still live here?" she asked.

The prince shrugged once more. "Sergeant Gyalpa says that people can
get used to just about anything, if it goes wrong slowly enough. These
are still the best apple orchards in Gandan, and some of the soldiers
say their families have been farming here since even before the
Pilots. A lot of them only join up when the Blight starts eating away
at their farm."

The prince shifted restlessly. He was not used to the way the cloud
molded itself to his shape, and kept trying to lean against it as if
it were a chair. "Of course, most of the smugglers we've caught have
come from families that live near the Blight, too. They seem to be
able to get around in it better than people from far away. We caught
one man a couple of months ago who'd found a charm that turned him
into a crocodile. He'd put it on, then swim up the river until he
found something he thought he could sell, and then bring it back in
his jaws."

Noxy shivered again. "How'd you catch him?"

The prince grimaced. "Something with a bigger mouth than his took a
bite out of his tail. He fetched up against the spells on the dam,
along with all the other stuff that had come floating downriver. A
couple of the soldiers fished him out and destroyed the charm. He's
still in the hospital."

----------------------------------------

Noxy had never met any of the people who filed through the dining room
door, but she recognized them immediately.  Their clothes were well
made but not showy, and as each bowed and said, "Good evening, Your
Highness," to the prince, she could hear the confidence in their
voices.  They were the sort of people who were used to running things,
the sort of people she had watched her mother bargain with since she
was a little girl.

The first few minutes of dinner felt like a bad dream to Noxy.  There
Shudarga sat, chatting pleasantly with merchants ... FIXME

Everyone had heard about a cloud landing in the garrison yard, of
course, and about the tornado's latest attack---awful, that, simply
awful.  But Noxy got the feeling the people who said that actually
meant it.  Apple Bridge might have a clock tower and a theater, but at
heart it was still a country town not much different from Marandine.
The merchants and artisans who made up the market association still
worked in their own shops and counted their own coins.  They knew the
family whose home had been destroyed that afternoon, and seemed
genuinely worried about what might happen next.

Just as she was starting to relax... FIXME
But the prince's voice stiffened when he made the last introduction.
"Noxy of Marandine, Master Bortja of the leatherworkers' guild."

The heavy-set man who had been waiting patiently at the end of the
line bowed in response.  "A pleasure to meet you, m'lady cloudherd,"
he said in a voice as rich as gravy, but not quite as rich as the
silver embroidery in his cuffs and collar.  "Truly, a pleasure.  I've
watched clouds fly by since I was a boy.  It must be wonderful,
looking down on everyone like that.  Almost like being royalty."

"I wouldn't know," Noxy replied.  "About being royalty, I mean."

The man's smile broadened.  "Of course.  Oh, and I see your highness's
pet troll is joining us.  I hope you've had a chance to speak with him
about the trouble this afternoon?"

"I'm aware of what happened, thank you," the prince replied stiffly.
"And as I've told you before, he's not a pet---he's my tutor.  And he
prefers to be called an orangutan, not a troll."

The man's smile broadened.  "Dear me---will the world *ever* stop
changing?  M'lady?  Your Highness?"  He bowed again to excuse himself
and went to join the knot of people in front of the window.

"Who was *that*?" Noxy asked.

The prince's mouth twisted sourly.  "*That* was Master Bortja.  He's
the head of the market association.  Which, by the way, he founded.
He doesn't think I'm doing enough to---" and here the prince started
counting on his fingers "---mend the stayposts along the river, keep
riff-raff out of the Dog Market, stop smuggling, lower taxes, and find
out who's behind these *dastardly* tornado attacks."  The prince
sighed.  "I don't think he likes me very much."

Noxy snorted.  "Did you really just say 'dastardly'?"

"Don't blame me---he said it first."  His expression grew serious.
"But he's right about a lot of things.  Half the stayposts are rotten,
and if the tornado ever decides to visit Apple Bridge..."

"...that'll be the end of Apple Bridge," Noxy finished for him.  She
punched his arm gently.  "Don't worry, you'll figure it out.  But
anyway, what does he have against your tutor?"

The prince shrugged.  "He's just saying what a lot of people around
here think---that the Gifted should still be property."

Noxy snorted again.  "I wonder what Kulbinder would have to say about
that."

"He'd probably tell them that as far as cats are concerned, it's
*people* who are property."  A delicate little bell went *ting!* The
prince offered Noxy his arm.  "Shall we get this over with?"

----------------------------------------


"Oh, it's not that bad, Your Highness," Sergeant Gyalpa said gruffly.
He had sat stiffly through the entire dinner, his back never touching
his chair, holding his knife and fork as carefully as Princess Ogmin.
"Just need to know by cooking them properly."

"Ah, a true bridger. The Sergeant grew up near here," he explained to
Noxy. "As did Sergeant Ramdu, I believe."

"Yes, Your Highness."  The sergeant's voice, soft and husky, seemed at
odds with her skinny frame. Like the family they had rescued from the
tornado, her hair was cut short and dyed henna-brown.

"There are quite a few local people in royal service," Mope
observed. "I suppose living this close to the Blight helps focus one's
attention on how precious the rule of law truly is."

"I wasn't along thinking much about precious rules," Sergeant Gyalpa
said. "Mostly I just wanted to see what the rest of the world looked
like." He nodded toward Noxy. "I've been in service nineteen years by
the calendar, close to thirty by my own reckoning, and I probably
haven't seen as much in all that as you'd see in a summer."

"Oh, I don't know," Noxy replied. "At least you've actually *seen*
places.  I've flown over Chaghan twice, but all I really know of it is
a couple of cloud pens and the hostel by the lake where the clouds
fill up for raining."

"I suppose that's always the way of things," the prince said. "You can
see a few things up close, or a lot from a distance. You can know a
thousand people by name, or a handful well."

"So why did you become a soldier?" Noxy asked Sergeant Ramdu.

Sergeant Ramdu kept her eyes on her food. "Didn't have much by
choice," she said. "My folks had a farm up along the Trout. There'd
always been such and all washing out from the Blight, but we had come
a couple of years that just plain rusted our luck. One of the folk as
took us in told me you can only beat magic with magic.  Only place to
learn it along these parts was the service."

"Surely there were other magicians around who would have taken you on
as an apprentice?" Mope asked. When Sergeant Ramdu didn't answer, he
glanced at Prince Thokmay.

"Sergeant?" the prince said sharply. "I believe my tutor asked you a
question."

"Yes, Your Highness," said the sergeant. "There's a few along by Apple
Bridge, but my folks didn't have such silver as they'd all ask."

"It's a shame the market association hadn't yet been founded," Master
Bortja cut in.  "That's part of our purpose, you see---looking after
those in need and making sure talent like the sergeant's is put to
good use."

"Ah, but who decides which uses are good?" Mope replied, waggling a
finger.  "And more than that, good for all?  In uniform, the sergeant
serves all Gandan-o equally---can you say she would have done the same
if she had been indebted to your association?"

"I'm sure she would have done a great deal for the *people* of Apple
Bridge." Master Bortja locked eyes with the troll, his meaning as
clear as his smile was cold.

"Knowing the sergeant as I do, I'm sure she would have done a great
deal for *everyone*," the prince cut in.

Master Bortja's smile broadened.  "Ah, but that's part and all of
being royalty, isn't it?  You've always had done for you, so you think
every else has too, but it's not the way of things, at least not along
by here."  He shook his head.  "Bridgers have done with short and all
long enough to know that we can't rely on anyone other to do for us.
It's time and long past that we had a proper city charter so we can
look to our own affairs as we best see the need."

"Yes, we've all heard your speech," Mope muttered, but the other
diners were muttering too, "Hear, hear," and, "Well said."

The prince cleared his throat.  "I fear the hour grows late," he said
firmly.  "And we were all best in our beds."

"But I don't want to go to bed," Princess Ogmin pouted. "I want Noxy
to give me a ride on her cloud."

"Not tonight, Your Highness," Mope said gently. "It's dark, and the
cloud isn't feeling well."

"But I *want* to!" Princess Ogmin snapped, smacking the top of the
table with her hands. Unfortunately, her plate was in the way. The
crust of her pie sailed through the air and landed on the prince's
jacket.

Someone snorted.  Ogmin's hands flew to her mouth. "Uh oh."

Prince Thokmay dabbed at the stain with his napkin.  "It's all right,"
he said gently. "It will clean off. But it really is your bedtime."

"I'm sorry," Princess Ogmin whispered. She stood up hurriedly and made
a little bow to her brother, tears in her eyes.

As she turned to leave Noxy said, "If you want, we could go somewhere
tomorrow. Would you like that?"

Princess Ogmin nodded hesitantly. "They have beaver tails at the Dog
Market?" she said, making it a question. "With cinnamon?"

Noxy smiled. "That sounds good. But you'd better get a good night's
sleep, so that we can start early."

"I will," the princess promised. She bowed again to the prince and
hurried from the room. As the door closed, Noxy heard her tell one of
the servants, "Do you think Noxy is pretty? *I* think she's pretty."

Noxy blushed slightly. "Her Highness is, um, always one to speak her
mind," Mope said, looking out the window instead of at Noxy.

"Always has been," the prince agreed dryly. He pushed back his chair,
waited a moment for everyone else to stand, then rose to his feet with
his wine glass in his hand. "Sergeant? If you please?"

"Thank you, Your Highness." Sergeant Gyalpa raised his own
glass. "Gandan preserved!" Noxy hastily picked up glass as the
others touched their own to their lips.

The next few minutes were a replay of the evening's start.  The
marketeers bowed to Prince Thokmay, complimenting him for the
meal---the soup had been superb, and the pie, perfect---as if he had
cooked it himself.  A few bowed a trifle unsteadily to Noxy as well,
having clearly had one or two more glasses of wine than they were used
to.

Master Bortja was the last to go.  "I trust I gave no offense speaking
my mind," he said.

"Of course not."  The prince put out his hand.  "And I trust you will
continue to do so, even if we continue to disagree."

The master leatherworker shook the prince's hand firmly.  "That's a
bargain I'd be pleased to keep.  M'lady, good evening."  He bowed
again to Noxy and joined the tail of the group being escorted out by
the two sergeants.

"And good riddance."  Mope didn't bother to mutter this time, or to
mute the contempt in his voice.  "Honestly, Your Highness, did you
*have* to seat him opposite us?  It quite spoiled the soup for me."

"He's important," the prince said tiredly.  "And he has some good
points."

"If he does, they're all borrowed," the troll snorted.  "He has no
respect for position, Your Highness, none at all."

"If my grandmother had cared as much about position as you do, you
would still be property," the prince pointed out.  He stretched and
yawned, holding up a hand to stop his tutor from replying.  "Now, it's
late, and we've all had busy days.  Noxy, one of the staff will show
you to your room.  And *you*," he added, lowering his hand to point
accusingly at Mope, "You will go to your room as well.  No midnight
adventures tonight, agreed?"

"Your Highness," the troll said with a bow.
