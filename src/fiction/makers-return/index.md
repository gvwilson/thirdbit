## I Shall Give Them Back (Sindy)

Sindy lay in bed waiting for the sun to rise
and wishing that it wouldn't
The rain had stopped an hour ago.
Raindrops made a steady plip, plip, plip outside her window
as they fell from one leaf to the next.
She hadn't heard the storm start,
so she must have slept,
but she still felt wearier all the way down into her bones.

Soft knuckles rapped gently on her door.
"Sindy?
It's time to get up, love.
We don't want to miss this."

*Yes we do,* she thought,
even though she knew she would never forgive herself if she did.
"Coming, mama."
She pushed aside the heavy quilt she had slept under
since she was old enough to have a room of her own,
swung her legs out of the bed,
and looked at the clothes she had laid out on her chair the night before.
The gray dress was the first thing she had ever owned besides boots and underwear
that wasn't a hand-me-down.
She and her mother had sewn it for the trip they had planned to take to Sandy Bend.
She wished that was why she was going to wear it.

Papa Roo was already at the kitchen table when she went downstairs.
"You look nice," he said,
holding out an arm to pull her in for a quick hug.

"Thanks, papa."
She sat and took a slice of thick, dark toast from the stack in the middle of the table
while her father poured her a cup of tea.
After waiting a few moments,
Papa Roo took Sindy's plate and began spreading raspberry jam on it.

"I can do that," Sindy said.

Her father nodded without stopping.
"I know, but I like doing things for you sometimes."

Mama Roo and Sindy's sister Maddy joined them a few minutes later.
They had brushed their fur until it almost shone,
but their expressions were solemn.
Other than a quiet, "Pass the jam?" and, "Thank you,"
they ate in silence.

"We can take care of those later," Mama Roo said
when Sindy stood to put her plate in the square tin bucket they used as a sink.
Sindy nodded,
then to her surprise found herself crying again:
not the deep sobs that had shaken her when the mayor had arrived to tell them
that Special Leaf was gone,
just raindrops spilling out of her eyes and running down her cheeks.

She wiped them away with her sleeve,
took a deep breath to steady herself,
and said, "I guess we should get going."

Rusty Bridge wasn't a big town,
but it was big enough to have its own cemetery grove.
Dockety had asked if it and the other bots could help with Special Leaf's planting.
Mayor Lupus had thank it but shaken her head.
"Y'all are welcome to join us, though," she added.
"He would've wanted you to be there."

As the Roos arrived,
it seemed like everyone within half a day's walk or ride wanted to be there as well.
The Ox brothers,
Zeke Bear,
a mixed family of deer and raccoons,
a double dozen bots off to one side in a cluster around Dockety and Crucher—Sindy kept her eyes down
and let her parents and her sister respond to their murmured hellos.
She managed a "hello" to Gumption,
who had polished his budding horns and combed the knots out of his fur,
then took her place at her sister's side.

As the sun's trailing edge let go of the hilltops to the east,
Mayor Lupus stepped up onto the dark rectangular stone that was the grove's only adornment
and rapped her gnarlywood cane on it three times.
The quiet conversations in the crowd faded,
leaving only the whisper of the wind through the branches.
