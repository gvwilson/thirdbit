template: page
fiction: true
---

- Final book in the trilogy (will be a good opportunity for me to practice endings)
- Major points
  - The last of the Makers' ships returns
  - Only a couple of adults have survived: the other passengers are all children
  - They think the bots and "brids" (hybrids) are meant to serve them
  - Blazes and other hard-line Operators want to go to war
  - The bots are split as well (uneasy alliance)
- Story is told from two points of view
  - Sindy has never felt like she fits in
  - Violet has spoken with several imprisoned brids over the years
  - Sindy: "I'm not one of them, but I'm not one of you either."
  - Violet (later): "I'm not one of them, but I'm not one of you any more."
- Moment of crisis: Patient restores itself from a backup copy
  - Is furious that the Makers aren't what it expected
  - Wants to blow up their ship (and the whole valley with it)
  - In the end, Dockety takes what's left of Patient to the Tailor for mending
  - And the remaining children are woken up into a strange new world
