This is so interesting! Serious question: do you have another series planned? Switching the main POVs from Maddy/Gumption to Sindy suggests a larger movement, broadening the original scope and branching out into the world. Also, the big shocker at the end. Tailor might be the only one who could keep Patient in check.

Even with just an outline, you've captured a real sense of loneliness and isolation. It's important that you show it's not limited to a specific  individual or social strata. Even Patient's mad bomber tendency is driven by the loneliness of having achieved something you spent a lifetime working for only to find it wasn't remotely what you thought it would be. 

After chapter 16, the outline loses track of Captain Lawson. What does he get up to after the brain reading machine? Is he ok?

Why does Nash steal the robot control helmet in Chap 19? It's great for upping the stakes and action, but why? To destroy the ship? Take it over? Is there a deeper intention or is Nash just even more hardcore than Blazes?

Dr Meadows being an AI brings up other questions, including: was the 'last' battle AI vs autonomous robots? With humans caught in the middle (probably having wronged both sides?). Is there a human version of Dr. Meadows or is Lawson the only adult human left? Did other humans go elsewhere rather than into cryo?

What are Maddy and Gumption up to during all this? I'm guessing fighting alongside Beevey and Dockety? And what about those oddly likeable idiots, Bluster and Bravo? (I know they're foils but somehow I care).
