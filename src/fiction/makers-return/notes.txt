# The Makers Return

-   Final book in the trilogy
    -   Will be a good opportunity for me to practice endings
-   Major points
    -   The last of the Makers' ships returns
    -   Only a couple of adults have survived: the other passengers are all children
    -   They think bots and "brids" (hybrids) are meant to serve them
    -   Blazes and other hard-line Operators want to go to war
    -   The bots are split as well: form an uneasy alliance with the Operators
    -   A child from each side must work together to prevent war
-   Story is told from two points of view
    -   Sindy has never felt like she fits in
    -   Violet's whole world is gone
    -   But Violet has spoken with several imprisoned brids over the years
    - Refer back to "In Heck" encounter with Maddy
    -   Sindy: "I'm not one of them (meaning hybrids), but I'm not one of you either (meaning human)."
    -   Violet (later, to the adult humans): "I'm not one of them (meaning hybrids), but I'm not one of you any more."
-   Big bang at the end
    -   Patient restores itself from a backup copy
    -   Is furious that the Makers aren't what it expected
    -   So it wants to blow up their ship (and the whole valley with it)
