## Chapter 11

There were Marines on board the hovercraft,
all apparently imprinted with the same taciturn personality.
Two of them flanked Benício
as he disappeared stone-faced into the belly of the hovercraft
while Wales explained to Iffy
that the Ecologist would be fine.
"Anyway,
it's not as if what he tried to do would actually have worked,"
he said.
In real life,
brainwipes were a lot less reliable but a lot more predictable than they were in sims.
Deep memories would survive the EMP pulse,
just as a person's original personality survived imprinting.
As for more recent knowledge,
well,
the Shepherds had undoubtedly changed their access codes already,
and their network of shelters and greenhouses weren't actually as secret as they thought.

Iffy expected to be locked in a cell next to Benício.
Instead,
a Marine ushered her up steeply-laddered steps to the hovercraft's cockpit.
"Have a seat," Wales said,
gesturing at the padded chair to the left of the one he had been sitting in.
"And buckle up.
This thing was built for speed, not comfort."

Iffy limped over to the chair
and lowered herself onto it with a wince.
Wales clucked his tongue.
"I'll have someone take a look at that for you later."

"Don' worry about it,"
Iffy muttered.

Wales sighed.
"Look,
Iffy,
I'm sorry, all right?
I am.
If there had been any other way I would have taken it,
but once Gayathri figured out who you are—*what* you are—I had to play along.
Believe me,
everything else would have been a lot worse."

Seating himself and snapping harness straps together across his chest,
he laid his hands on the apps set into the arms of his chair.
The display in front of them came to life.
A dozen views of the surrounding tundra
nestled between status displays like those Iffy had grown up with on the *Guinevere*.
Temperatures and battery reserves,
the rotational speeds of idling engines,
weather reports,
and projections from a hundred independent simulations of the next few moments
waited for attention
like courtiers waiting on a king.

"Where are you takin' us?" Iffy asked sullenly.
She had loosened the straps of her harness so that she could wriggle out if she needed to,
but the straps had re-tightened themselves
as soon as the engine came to life.

"Home, sort of,"
Wales replied absently
as he rearranged the display with a few flicks of his fingers.
"Now don't mind the noise.
You'll get used to it."

The engines beneath them rumbled.
The hovercraft rose like a ship being lifted by a wave
and rotated smoothly on its cushion of air.
Orange status lights blinked and turned green
as the sentry bots climbed back aboard.
"All accounted for, sir,"
said the Marine seated beside Iffy.

"Yippee ki-yay."
Wales flicked his fingers again.

The hovercraft shot forward like a startled seagull.
Acceleration pushed Iffy back in her seat.
Fifty klicks an hour, a hundred… two hundred…
At two hundred and fifty the numbers on the display stopped climbing
and the pressure lifted from her chest.
She took a deep breath and watched the world race by
as the hovercraft bumped and shook toward the horizon.
The only people in the world going faster than her at that precise moment
were either on trains
or desperate enough to take to the air
and hope the machines' satellites didn't spot them.

The novelty wore off quickly.

A Marine showed up a few minutes later
to give Iffy a patch to dull the pain in her knee
and speed its healing.
Her eyelids grew heavy
as the drugs and accelerators seeped through her skin.
Even a mug of thick, sweet tea
wasn't enough to keep them from closing.

At least,
that's what she hoped whoever was watching her would believe.
She had learned how to keep sleep at bay on night watches long ago.
Right now,
she had some thinking to do
and she didn't want to be disturbed.

*Wireframes swam in the darkness.
The hovercraft had been built as a blockade runner in Tashkent
before the start of the machine wars.
Its heart was a reactor originally designed for use in a submarine—she
took a moment to admire the sleek, single-minded recklessness of its design—and
the motors that created its cushion of air
would have pumped fuel at hypersonic speeds
in orbital booster rockets
if history had unfolded just a little bit differently.
The hull plating was angled to deflect the energy of ballistic attacks
and threaded with microfilaments not unlike those in Benício's skull
to handle electronic ones.
Ventilation tubes,
triple-redundant optical wiring,
and plumbing liberated from a luxury hotel
slithered between bulkheads.*

*She flipped the wireframe upside down and rightside up,
flew through it,
spun it around.
Any of a dozen rooms or holds could have been repurposed as a cell.
For one moment she thought about reaching out to the hovercraft's core,
but it would be better protected than the railgun back on the pier.*

She yawned widely.
The images slipped away as her concentration finally conceded
to the painkillers and reconstructives.
A moment later she began to snore for real.

She woke to the smell of curried noodles,
and for a few disoriented seconds she thought she was back on the *Guinevere*.
But no,
she was still buckled into her chair in the cockpit of the hovercraft.
She took the plate that the expressionless Marine offered her
and fumbled with the chopsticks
while she waited for her mind to catch up with the rest of her.

Wales was gone,
but the gently undulating tundra on the screens around her looked the same as it had.
Their speed hadn't changed either,
she noticed,
or their heading.
They were headed for Mount Tyree or somewhere nearby.

She looked up at the Marine.
"It's really good,
but can I please have some more onions on it?
An' some more tea?
If that's aright,"
she added hastily.

The Marine looked at her,
his expression still as empty as the tundra.
"Good morning,
Iffy,"
Wales said through a speaker somewhere behind her.
"I'm glad to see you have an appetite."

"It's really good," she said truthfully.
"I'm just used t' more onions."

"Mm.
And of course you'd like to see more of the *Henry Lion*,
I assume."

She shrugged.
"Not much else t' do,
'less you're aright with me talkin' to Benício for a bit."

"I'm afraid that's out of the question for now,"
Wales said regretfully.
"All right.
Private Norbu will take you down to the galley
and then show you to your cabin.
Promise you won't do anything foolish?"

"Sure.
An' I promise I'll keep it as well as you've kept yours."
She wriggled out of the straps without spilling any of her noodles,
then stood up and tested her knee.
Whatever had been in the patch seemed to have set it right.
If she had to run,
she could.
The trick now was having somewhere to run *to*.

As she stepped past Private Norbu
she slipped the metal button cover she had pried off her chair
into her pocket.

The galley was twice the size of the *Guinevere*'s
but much noisier.
The schematic in her head showed her the pipes,
drive shafts,
and optical cables
crammed into the half meter between its floor
and the foamed steel armor on the hovercraft's belly.
She could see three different ways to make trouble if she could reach them,
but she had no way to do that.
Even if she did,
they all had backups that had backups of their own.
The hovercraft was tough by design:
someone could punch a dozen shots from a heavy-duty railgun right through it
without slowing it down.

Private Norbu stood near the galley door and watched her eat.
She ignored him the same way she had learned to ignore shopkeepers
who didn't think an orphan dredger had any place in their store.
She thought briefly about trying to steal her chopsticks,
but by the time she finished her tea she had decided it was too risky.
They felt like aluminum,
and she could do a lot with a couple of aluminum rods,
but Private Norbu was right there
and there were probably cameras she couldn't see as well.
No,
the chopsticks were almost certainly a dead end.
The loose screw on the underside of the table,
on the other hand…

Her cabin had a fold-up bunk
and a single shallow drawer set into the bulkhead.
She picked up the app that lay on the neatly-dressed bunk
as Private Norbu closed and locked the door behind her.
It was the same model she had used as a child,
but completely locked down:
she couldn't even get the weather on it,
much less connect to Hell.

She kicked off her boots and lay down.
"Lights," she said after a moment.
The room dutifully went dark.
She closed her eyes,
took slow, steady breaths to slow her pulse,
then tried to visualize herself.

Nothing happened at first,
or rather,
hundreds of things that weren't her formed, flew apart, and re-formed behind her eyes.
She saw something that looked like a mechanical musk ox
designed to hide in the herd,
and marvelled for a moment at
the ingenious way it emulated its organic namesake's digestive processes.
This was the *Guinevere* as she had been the day she first sailed.
And that—right there—was her.

She forgot to breathe for a moment as the image rotated slowly,
panning and zooming as her attention shifted.
In her spine,
along her nerves,
laced through her brain:
they weren't wires—those would be too easy for a scanner to spot—but rather
tiny fractalized patches of cells arranged in precisely the right way
to make her a living antenna.

And any antenna that could receive a signal could send one.

It only took her a minute to find an opening in the hovercraft's systems.
It took her another five to find one that wasn't a trap,
and another hour to convince herself that she was right.
Fifteen years ago,
just a few days after she had been born,
a tech in Paddington South had replaced a reactor coolant pump
with one salvaged from an Aussie submarine
that had suffered a catastrophic loss of containment.
(Her hand twitched as if swiping an app
to toss aside the insurance reports and obituaries
that thought called up.)
The tech had cut corners to meet a deadline
(another twitch dispelled performance reviews and der eventual punitive imprinting).
One of those corners had been a software shim
to connect the monitor's century-old software
to the hovercraft's merely elderly systems.

She studied the code tangled around the hardware
like nerves and veins around bones.
The pump's core was dumber than a seagull:
if she nudged it there and there and *there*,
it would believe that the hovercraft's reactor was going critical
and bypass its own safeties to prevent disaster.
When the other pumps asked it what the hell it thought it was doing,
the long-ago tech's shoddy work would let her persuade them
that they had been ordered to shut down for maintenance.

She smiled,
not caring who might be watching through a hidden camera,
then rolled on her side and brought her hand to her mouth
as if to stifle a yawn.

The metal button cover she had stolen was stronger than she had expected.
For a moment she thought she might crack a tooth,
but then it bent enough for her to bite down and flatten it.
She spat the half-circle of metal with its two precious points
back into her hand,
rolled over again to cover the motion of slipping it back into her pocket,
and *pushed* with her mind.

Eleven point two meters away,
a pump whirred into overdrive.
Exactly three seconds later
its partners queried it,
compared the answers they received,
and powered down.
Iffy squelched the notifications they sent to the hovercraft's core
moments before they would have set off an alarm.
*Sleep well,* she thought giddily.
She had never ridden a high-speed multi-ton atom bomb before.
She wondered how many people had,
and how many of them had lived to tell the tale.

She didn't realize her nose was bleeding
until an alarm klaxon began to blare
and she tried to stand up.
She had expected the alarm—in fact,
she was counting on it—but
she hadn't counted on being so lightheaded that
the room went distant and swam around her.
She bent over,
her elbows on the bunk and her face pressed against her forearms.

"Shad," she swore weakly.
There was a lot of blood,
even more than the time Akumé had punched her in the face
for calling der a thief
(which de had been,
but the other kids on the pier had been too smart or too afraid of der to say it).
Wiping her face with a handful of bedsheet didn't stop the steady red drip.

Iffy laughed weakly.
She had been so worried that someone would notice her stealing the button cover,
and now it turned out she needn't have bothered.
She wouldn't have to scratch herself to get a few red cells
to fool the hovercraft's genetic sensors:
she had as many as she could possibly want.

She straightened up and worked her tongue in her mouth.
It still felt like someone had replaced it with a piece of pressed jellyfish,
but the room was longer an endlessly-receding tunnel from a horror sim.
She focused on the app lying on the bunk and pushed with her mind once again.
Something inside the door clicked and it slid aside.

Two minutes later she stood in front of another cabin door
and pressed her sticky hand against the contact place beside it.

"Affin' heck, girl, what happened t' you?"
Benício asked as he stood.

"You should see the other guy," she said
grinning woozily.
"Any idea where our gear is?"

He shook his head.
"Not a moss.
So what now?"

She jerked her chin toward the stern.
"Back an' out 's as far as I got."

Someone was banging against one of the doors they passed.
They were shouting, too.
Iffy thought it was funny but didn't have enough energy to laugh.
At some point Benício had put his arm around her to help her stay upright.
He had picked up a fire extinguisher as well,
a compact red cylinder with a silver handle
whose basic design hadn't changed in centuries.
She blinked away the specs that flashed into her mind.
*Not now,* she thought.
Her nose was still dripping.
Anyone who wanted to find them could just follow the trail of drops and streaks on the floor.

"Here," she mumbled.
"…straps…"

"*Está bem*, I got it,"
Benício said soothingly.
He turned her around and lowered her onto the molded plastic seat,
then buckled the harness across her chest
and pulled a bulky pair of goggles down over her eyes and nose.
"Bite on this,"
he told her,
pushing a mouthpiece against her lips.

Cold air filled her lungs as she breathed in.
"Ready?
No,
don' worry,
I'll be right behind you."
He took her wrists and placed her hands on the grips built into the seat.
"One… two… *three*."

She screamed into the mouthpiece as hovercraft fired the ejection seat into the air
like an old-fashioned artillery shell.
Daylight blinded her and ice-cold wind instantly numbed her cheeks.
Tiny gyros whined to stabilize the chair
long enough for the explosive bolts in its back to fire.
A translucent parawing snapped open.
The surge of deceleration threw her against her harness
and then she was swinging like a pendulum
as the parawing's tiny core picked a safe landing spot
and turned toward it.

The ground below her was covered with snow.
The harsh white reached from horizon to horizon,
interrupted only by a few dark boulders
and the camouflaged rectangular bulk of the hovercraft
that was already a hundred meters away,
but Iffy didn't have time to think about that,
or about the second ejection seat that the hovercraft
had just fired into the air.
She was flying,
really actually flying,
except it had to be over in a few seconds
before a satellite decided they had broken the machines' "no flying" rule,
and even if that didn't happen
the chair hit the ground the wrong way and snap her neck.
The gyros were supposed to prevent that,
but she had seen their specs when she was planning her escape,
and they had last been serviced by the same tech
who had screwed up the coolant pump.

Snow raced away beneath her far too fast for safety.
She was headed straight for a boulder.
She was going to hit it.
She was going to hit it,
but the parawing cupped the air to brake,
throwing her hard against the straps.

The chair landed on the snow with a crunch.
Iffy spat out the mouthpiece,
pulled off her goggles,
wriggled out of the straps,
tripped,
and fell face-first into the little snowbank thrown up by the chair's impact.
Ice crystals stung her face and hands.
It was cold,
she realized,
really cold.
They must have come further inland than she had realized.

The chair bleeped.
Panels popped off its bulky arms
to reveal a featherweight windproof parka rolled up
to be not much larger than a roti on one side
and a waistpack on the other.
She unrolled the parka and put it on,
then unzipped the pack.
A tiny first aid kid,
a ruggedized app,
a pair of multitools,
and three high-energy snack bars:
the specs had shown four,
and for a moment she wondered if that long-ago tech had gotten hungry while de was working.

Her nosebleed had stopped,
but she was still lightheaded.
She clambered awkwardly up the boulder
and shielded her eyes with her hand.
There—Benício's chair had just landed a few hundred meters away.
Wales had undoubtedly retaken control of the hovercraft,
only to discover that all three coolant pumps had burned out
and would need to be replaced
before it could move again.
That meant his Marines would be putting on their exoskeletons,
which meant she and Benício only had a few minutes before they arrived.

"Hey!"
She waved both arms.
Benício waved back and started toward her.
Iffy slipped off the boulder,
made her way back to the chair,
and got to work.

The upper back plate on the ejection seat had six screws.
The lower plate only had four.
She pocketed them as she took them out.
"No such thing as scrap," she muttered under her breath.
It was one of Mister Mishra's favorite sayings,
but there wasn't time to think about him or Jeep
because she had to tighten the spigot valve on the seat's tiny fuel line all the way
before prying out the fist-sized tank of peroxide
or she and her escape were going to be very short-lived.

Benício's boots crunched on the snow.
"What're you—oh no.
No no no,
you can't be serious."

She grinned madly and pointed at the parawing
without looking up from the vernier motor she was crimping into place.
"Straighten that out if you can
an' then get the straps off th' chair.
We're gonna have t' double up."

Another minute, another minute—there.
Benício handed her the ends of the parawing's tether lines.
She clipped them onto the harness and handed it back to him.
"I can't carry you, so you gotta carry me," she said,
cutting off his protests.

The snow field dipped gently on the far side of the boulder.
It wasn't much,
but it would have to do.
"Ready?" she asked.

Benício shook his head.
"Nope."
He bent over like a sprinter and started to run.

Iffy waited for the lines to go nearly taut before shouting,
"Now!"
and yanking the edge of the parawing up as hard as she could.
The makeshift motor strapped to Benício's back shrieked into life,
kicking him forward.
For an instant Iffy thought it wasn't going to work,
but the core she had pulled out of the chair wasn't smart enough to wonder
how or why its world had changed.
It just knew its wing was out of position.
Tiny motors whirred,
frantically adjusting the parawing's shape
so that it cut the air at just the right angle
to lift Benício into the air.

He whooped,
his feet still pedalling as they left the ground.
Iffy ran back and scrambled up the boulder and shielded her eyes,
her heart pounding.
Four black dots had come over the horizon.
She counted seconds under her breath.
The snow was slowing them down, but not much.

"Over here!" she shouted,
waving as Benício banked in a wide, clumsy turn.
One moment he was over *there*
and the next he was coming straight at her,
wide-eyed and shouting something she couldn't hear.
She took a deep breath and spread her arms wide.

Benício hit her with a thump that cracked her spine.
His hands scrabbled for purchase on her parka,
but the fabric was too slippery,
it was designed to shed water and he couldn't get a grip
but that was aright,
she had grabbed the straps
and her feet were kicking at nothing but air.

She twisted around as far as she dared as he whooped again.
The motor on his back shrieked again,
pushing them higher.
*It's me, it's just me,* she thought frantically,
hoping that whatever faraway machine she had made her bargain with was listening.

"So what now?"
Benício had to shout to be heard over the wind in their ears.

"There's a place up ahead,"
Iffy shouted back.
"We'll have to walk after that."

The snow field below her looked exactly like a sim but was completely different.
She finally understood why so many people wrote poetry about flying,
and why they said that of all the machines had taken away from humanity,
this was the one whose loss hurt the most.

The makeshift motor burned out the next time they tried to use it,
but lasted long enough for them to catch the wind.
Antarctica rolled away behind them.
Iffy's shoulders began to ache,
then to burn.
The straps they were tangled in dug in to her triceps.
She'd have bruises,
but the view—whatever else happened,
she swore she would find a way to fly again.

After one last lift from a thermal rising off a stretch of exposed rock
they began a long, slow descent.
"Get ready!" Benício shouted.
Iffy grabbed the strap with one numb hand and let go with the other
so that she was half beside and half behind him.
The parawing's little motors whined in protest as they reshaped it
to adjust for the shift in weight.
Ten seconds…
Five…
As her boots grazed the snow she tried to run,
but her toe caught on a crust of ice.
She let go of Benício and sprawled face-forward.

"Well," Benício said a moment later
as the parawing carried the harness away.
"Can't wait to tell Nagatha about *that*."

She wiped ice and snow off her face and returned his grin.
"Me too.
C'mon,
we gotta keep movin'."

Two snack bars and several mouthfuls of lukewarm water later,
they reached the nearest of the enormous machines.
Benício put a reverent hand on its tread.

they reached an outcropping of rock too regular to be natural.
Benício ran his hands over the pipe shafts drilled into its laser-cut top.
"Old weather station?" he hazarded.
"Looks like it was salvaged a long time gone."

"Mm hm."
Iffy pointed at the shadow on the horizon.
"You know what that is?"

Benício laughed.
"Girl,
I have no idea where I am right now.
You could tell me that was the Andes an' I'd believe you."

"That's Mount Tyree."
Iffy's voice was more serious than she'd intended.
"The secret base Wales an' th' machines an' everyone have been goin' on about?
It's pretty much right underneath us."

She pulled off her glove,
scraped some dried blood out of her nostril,
and stuck her finger in one of the drill holes.
The rock thought for a second and then opened with a faint click
to reveal a space the size of the toilet stall on the *Guinevere*.
A wraparound shelf held tools,
a rifle connected to a flimsy jumpsuit,
and a medical kit.
The center of the floor was taken up by a circular hatch.

She grinned at Benício.
"Welcome to my secret lair."

Whatever he might have said in reply was cut off by a low rumble.
She whirled around and froze as a white-furred head lifted off the snow three strides away.
"*Mãe do mundo*," Benício breathed
as the polar bear rosed to its feet.
For a heart-stopping moment Iffy *knew* that this was where and how her story would end,
but then she saw the familiar silver sheen of tech beneath the bear's fur.

*«danger / nearing / haste»*

"It says trouble's comin'," Iffy relayed.

"No kidding," Benício muttered.
"Don't suppose it's offerin' to help with that?"

As if on cue a second bear and then a third ambled around the outcropping.
One of them stopped next to the first.
The other took a tentative step forward,
only to hesitate and withdraw when the first bear growled at it.
It wasn't accelerated like the other two,
Iffy realized.
It was just several hundred kilograms of predator
looking at something edible and defenseless.

*«haste»*

Iffy jerked her chin at the hatch.
"It wants us to get movin'."

"Aright."
Benício stepped into the small chamber,
bent down,
grabbed the handwheel,
and yelped,
snatching his hand back.

"What's wrong?"
Iffy asked as the Ecologist swore in four different languages.

"It shocked me,"
he said accusingly.

*«undesired»*
Ideas emerged in Iffy's mind,
bumping into each other like ice floes.
She shook her head to clear it.

"I think it wants me on my own,"
she told Benício.
Without waiting for his reply she bent over and grabbed the handwheel herself.
When nothing happened she pulled it,
gently at first and then harder.
Metal screeched as it turned.
Once, twice, three times—click.
She lifted the hatch.

"Secret lair, eh?"
Benício said,
looking over her shoulder at the laddered shaft descending into the mountain.

She shrugged.
"Think there's treasure down there?"

The Ecologist snorted.
"Nope."
He reached past her to take the rifle and wriggled into its attached jumpsuit,
then oophed as she hugged him.

"Don't do anythin' stupid,"
she said fiercely.

He snorted again.
"Don't *you*."
They squeezed each other once more,
and then he turned to the bears and said,
"Aright, let's get goin'."

Iffy watched the foursome head downhill,
wondering if it was just an accident that the two accelerated bears
kept themselves between their unmodified partner and Benício.
The Marines' infrared would spot them immediately,
but even as she had the thought,
schematics and false-color visualizations flashed through her head.
The accelerated bears' tech would dampen and modify their heat signatures
long enough for them to look like half a dozen arctic rabbits
fleeing from the unmodified bear,
while Benício's jumpsuit would—

She shook her head.
It didn't matter.
They would do what they could, and so would she.
With a deep breath,
she turned around and started her descent.

Iffy was halfway down the ladder when her nose told her something was wrong.
The smell wasn't rank like the week-dead seagull she had once found in a dumpster behind the Sandhus' store,
trapped when the lid closed as it scrounged for scraps.
Instead,
it was tired and a little bit sad.

She felt oddly detached
as she studied the mummified body lying a stride away from the bottom of the ladder.
Whoever he had been,
he'd had long dark hair and a beard.
His parka was silvered like hers,
but unlike hers,
had a bullet hole in the back surrounded by an old, dark stain.

She shook herself.
"Well," she said out loud.
"Let's see what we got."

The answer turned out to be weapons,
dried food that had either spoiled or mummified like the corpse,
several snowsuits with boots and breathing masks
(she puzzled over this for a bit),
and a small workshop stocked with tools and spare parts that made her hands itch.
She turned a laser cutter over in her hands,
then pulled a tarp off something that looked like
an oversized version of the sentry bots from the governor's mansion.
One of its side panels was folded back to reveal its motors and cables.
Another tarp revealed a second bot with the same bulky body and limbs
but a cluster of cameras and antennas where its head should have been.
The mod had clearly been made in haste:
the welds joining the additions to the bot's neck looked messy and unfinished,
and a handful of string-thin optical cables dangled from the opening.

Iffy looked around the room a second time.
Something didn't make sense.
How were the bots going get out?
They wouldn't have been able to climb the ladder.

She sat down and put her elbows on the workbench.
It hummed faintly and came to life.
A single icon appeared,
waiting patiently to be tapped.

She studied it for a moment.
It could a trap—malware designed to mesmerize anyone who looked it,
or any of a hundred other scenarios from sims,
but what choice did she have?

A faint scum of dust felt gritty under her finger as she swiped its top.
"User recognized," a soft voice said.
Iffy blinked in surprise as the icon folded in on itself.

"—a chance to hear this,
but if you do,
I'm sorry.
I'm so, so sorry."
The recorded voice was a man,
and sounded tired and frightened and brave all at once.
"We thought we could fix things,
but we've only made them worse."

The voice chuckled or choked back a sob—it was impossible to tell which.
"Suyin went back in this morning while the rest of us were asleep.
She thought she might be able to make it to the machine
if she cycled the shielding rapidly enough,
but I think she just wanted to be with Georgia."

"I tried to disable the guard robots,
but some of them are still loose in the auxiliary tunnels."
The voice paused for a heartbreaking moment.
I know we all agreed that the project needed a failsafe,
but I never thought we'd need it.
I never thought—oh shit."

Iffy jumped at the sharp *crack!*
There was the sound of something heavy hitting the floor.
A moment later metal clicked on concrete,
and then the recording ended with a soft, cheerful *ding*.

The screen filled with icons and images like those in Iffy's app.
Two dozen smiling, confident faces were arranged on the app
in eight rows of three.
The top row contained a man with long dark hair and a beard
and two women who looked like clones of each other.
"Doctor Arno Severin,"
she read aloud.
The names below other images identified Suyin and Georgia.
The others were all of a similar age,
all smiling,
and—

And there,
in the bottom row,
was Commander Johnson Wales,
another man named Surjinder Johel that Iffy guessed was Doctor Johel's grandfather,
and an older version of herself labeled Suhailah Kwan.

There were no other recordings,
at least not that Iffy could find,
but there were maps showing a network of maintenance tunnels
just big enough for raccoons or slinky bots,
some running for kilometers.
She would be able to fit her arm into one of them,
but no more.

There were other tunnels,
though,
big enough for people and heavy equipment.
Some were dense with red flags that showed collapse,
flooding,
or chronic instability.
She puzzled over that for a second before dismissing it.

It took her a few minutes to realize that
the web of tunnels wasn't centered on the Niobium base.
Instead,
its heart was a kilometer further south.
That wasn't what made Iffy chew her lips as she studied the accompanying schematics, though.
She could think of a hundred uses for a superconducting ring
large enough to sail the *Guinevere* through,
but why put a cage for lab rats at its center?
And if you had a yottahertz laser capable of vaporizing steel from orbit,
why would you point it directly at an identical laser,
and why would you leave just enough space between them for
one (1) adult with arctic-rated camping equipment
and a month's worth of high-energy rations?

She sat back,
stretched,
and yawned so widely that her jaw clicked.
As tired as she was,
she needed to get moving.
*Any suggestions?* she thought,
but her voices were still silent.

It took her ten minutes to get the two sentry bots online.
Their optical sensors didn't glow red—that only happened in sims—but
she still took an involuntary step back when their heads turned in unison toward her.

"Sit," she ordered.
One lowered itself to the concrete.
The other studied her
while its core tried to decide whether her voice patterns
matched those in its memory closely enough.

"I said *sit*," she repeated as firmly as she could.
The bot took a step toward her,
hesitated,
and crouched beside its twin.

Iffy didn't know if anyone had ever built a chariot to be pulled by two sentry robots,
but if so,
she was pretty sure they hadn't made it out of a heavy-duty dolly and fiber optic cables.
She nudged it skeptically with her boot.
The frictionless bearings in its wheels were undamaged,
so it would roll enough,
but even without the schematics in her head
she could see that it would want to slip, tip, or flip
at every bump and corner.

She lowered herself gingerly onto the dolly.
A plastic crate full of tools pressed against her side,
and another with spare parts for the bots nestled under her elbow.
"Yip yip!" she said,
snapping the cables she had rigged as reins.

The bots didn't move.
Iffy sighed.
"Forward one quarter speed," she ordered.
The dolly jerked beneath her as the bots set off at a trot into the tunnel.

She thumbed a handlight and pointed it ahead of them.
"Increase speed to one half."
The dolly's wheels made a sizzling sound as they rolled faster into the unknown.

After half an hour her back was aching and her backside had gone numb.
She was about to order the bots to stop when they pulled up short.
"Whoa!" she squawked as the dolly smacked hard into their hind legs.

The bots ignored her.
Their heads twitched this way and that in an almost birdlike way.
The one that had hesitated before accepting her orders took a step and stopped.
Without warning a panel on its back flipped open
and something stubby and lethal looking popped up.

She swore under her breath.
The gun on the bot's back spun around to point at her.
"Take it easy," she said,
her heart suddenly pounding.

Metal clicked on concrete somewhere in the darkness ahead of them.
The bot's gun spun around again.

Iffy closed her eyes and tried to slow her breathing.
Nothing:
no images flashed into her mind
and no thoughts suddenly emerged fully-formed.

Metal clicked on concrete again.
Her eyes snapped open.
The sound was *behind* her this time.

She turned her head slowly.
Light reflected off three—no, four—bots
like the pair that had been pulling the dolly.
One was missing part of a foreleg.
Another's side was deeply dented
as if something had tried to punch right through it,
and all four bore more scratches and scars than Iffy could count.

The lead bot took one more step and halted.
Struck by a sudden thought,
she reached into the crate of tools she had packed earlier.
An adjustable wrench,
a screw jack that might be able to outdent the bot's side—what she really needed
was Mister Mishra's shop and Johnson Wales' toolbox,
but these would have to do.

She turned around to face the bots and held the tools out.
"Aright?" she asked.

None of the bots moved.
For one panicked moment Iffy thought she had guessed wrong,
but then the bot took two more steps toward her
and lowered itself into a crouch.

The bots had been built to be scouts and guards and weapons.
The blunt claws on the ends of their legs could pick up a rock
or grab hold of someone's arm,
but were no good for delicate work.
Scratches and dents on the bot's inner frame showed
where they had tried to repair each other anyway.

Wire,
a crimping tool,
a screwdriver with a torsion readout built into its handle—there.
She patted the bot's back.
"Good as new."
Which was a lie,
but felt like the right thing to say.

The bot stood,
braced its legs,
and shivered through a rapid self-test.
When the reflex capacitor that Iffy had just wired into place didn't rattle
it made a soft, incongruous *ping*
and stepped aside to make room for another member of its pack.

Iffy put her tools back in the crate and stood.
"I'm sorry,"
she said.
"I gotta keep movin',
but if you wanna come with me
I'll fix you when we get somewhere safe."

The bots didn't move.
"I really gotta go,"
Iff said,
turning to pick up her crate.

A clawed foreleg closed around her arm.
"Hey!"
She smacked it with her hand.
"None o' that, aright?"

The bot released her but didn't back up.
She glanced at the two still in harness and frowned,
struck by another idea.
The bots didn't have collars,
but a lifetime at sea had taught Iffy dozens of ways to tie a knot.
She left plenty of slack so that the bots could pull their heads out if they needed to.

When she was done,
the three bots that had all of their legs waited patiently in a line behind the dolly,
the cable looped around their necks.

"Come on, you," she said to the bot that was missing part of its leg.
"Up you get."
She put her hand where its neck would have been and tugged it forward.
Limping,
it clambered up onto the dolly and crouched down.

"Nope, nope, not there."
She tugged it again,
then sighed when it didn't move.
"Aright,
stay there if you want to—I'll get a better view up front anyway."
A moment later she was rolling through the tunnel once again
with three of the new bots following single file behind her.

Iffy leaned back gingerly against the crippled bot.
It rotated its head to study her.
After a moment she draped an arm over its back to steady herself.
It wasn't actually more comfortable than just sitting upright,
but it was somehow more comforting.

Against all odds her eyes began to close.
She snapped out of her doze when the bots pulled up short.
"Shad!"
The dolly smacked hard into the hind legs of the ones in front.
Six boxy clusters of sensors and cameras swivelled
to point back the way they had come.
That's when Iffy heard the rhythmic *clunk clunk clunk* of exoskeletoned feet on concrete.

She unlooped the cables around the bots' necks.
"Listen,"
she said,
squatting in front of the one she had repaired
so that her head and its sensors were on the same level.
"I know I'm not who you were s'posed t' be guardin',
but those folk back there?
They're *really* not s'posed t' be here."
She fished the screwdriver out of her pocket and held it up.
"You fix that an' I promise,
I'll do my best t' fix you an' your friends."

She had no reason to believe the bot could understand her.
There was no telling what strange loops might have formed in its core
as it patrolled these abandoned tunnels.
For all she knew it would take one look at the Marines
and decide they were its true masters.

But the bot took a step forward and to butted her gently with its head,
then turned and disappeared into the darkness
with its two companions at its heels.

The crippled bot rose on its three good legs.
It didn't make a sound,
but Iffy imagined that if it could have whined it would have.
"They'll be aright,"
she told it as she took her seat on the dolly,
wishing she believed her own words.

The first explosion echoed through the tunnel a few minutes later.
"Full speed!"
she ordered the harnessed bots.
Gunfire chattered behind them—Iffy couldn't tell how far away—and then
the sound-shock of another explosion rolled past them.

"Get down!" she ordered
The three-legged bot had risen to its feet again,
its body swaying slightly as its algorithms steadied its misbalanced weight
atop the dolly.

"I said get—affin' heck!"
Iffy ducked
as the bot jumped over her.
The dolly slewed wildly,
skidded,
and straightened out.

The tunnel was climbing now in a long steady incline.
The first painted stripe on the wall flew past so quickly that
she wasn't sure she had seen it.
A second followed,
then a third with a six-digit number stenciled next to it,
and then the tunnel leveled out and automatic lights came on over her head,
turning everything the dark red she associated with night watches.

The bots slowed and stopped
as the dolly rolled into a dimly-lit space several times larger
than the bunker they had left.
A blast door slid closed behind her,
metal scraping on stone for the first time in a century.
She had arrived.

"Lights?" she said after a moment.
"*Acendé luz?*
*Lampo roshan kon?*"

The crippled bot made a high-pitched whining sound.
Iffy squinted as clinically-white strips in the walls and ceiling obediently lit up,
then sucked in her breath.
She had hoped they would find a workshop
and feared it would be a graveyard,
but this—she hadn't expected this.

A thick cylinder lay on its side surrounded by pipes and machinery.
A bulky mass made of meter-square bricks loomed in the background.
The three-armed logo painted on its side was redundant:
even before schematics took shape in her head
she recognized the reactor for what it was.

The crippled bot on the dolly surged to its feet.
The panel on its back flipped open.
A stubby needle gun popped up.
Its targeting laser drew a thin red line through the air
to a squat four-wheeled service bot
that had just rolled into view from somewhere further back in the chamber.

The service bot froze and made a warbling sound.
The three-legged bot tilted its head toward Iffy.
"Um, sure," she said helplessly.
The laser blinked off,
but the sentry bot stayed on its feet
as the service bot began to wipe down the cylinder
with a brush whose bristles had long since worn away.

Iffy hunched her shoulders inside her parka and shivered.
She was hungry and tired and needed a bathroom,
but most importantly,
she didn't know what she was supposed to *do*.
Open the cylinder?
Fix it,
or blow it up somehow?

"Or just find a way out an' forget about it?"
she asked the empty air.

The service bot pivoted on its wheels to face her.
"The way out is simple, Iffy,"
a familiar voice said.
"All you have to do is talk to the machines for me
and we'll all get a happy ending."

## Chapter 12

Iffy reached into the tool crate and picked up a wrench.
"Iffy, please,"
Wales' voice chided.
"That's not going to—"

"Target!"
Iffy snapped,
pointing the wrench at the service bot.
The gun on the back of the sentry bot beside barked twice.
The first shot punched a hole through the service bot.
The second caught it off-center and sent it spinning across the floor.

The tunnel at the other end of the bunker had a blast door
to match the one behind them.
Iffy closed her eyes and rooted around in her not-memories of this place.
There.
She traced a shape on a contact pad beside the door,
then gasped as it slid open to reveal a pair of Marines.

"Oh Iffy,"
Wales' voice said through a speaker on one of their exoskeletons.
"I really didn't want to have to do this."

Iffy felt rather than saw the three-legged bot move.
"No!" she shouted.
Its gun fired twice
but it was already falling as the Marines' auto-targeted shots brought it down.

She was falling too.
Something had knocked the breath out of her.
She was lying on the concrete and it *hurt*,
it hurt so much that she couldn't even cry out,
not yet,
because the shot had gone right through her
just above her hip
and when she tried to breathe it felt like someone was kneeling on her back
and squeezing all the air out of her.

She heard Wales bark an order.
"No, don't," she tried to say
as exoskeletoned arms picked her up,
but the words came out as a gasp
and now she could breathe again
and the hurt spread through her like milk poured into tea.

Her head lolled to the side as the Marine placed her on a nearby work table.
One of them put a patch on her arm to take the pain away
except it was more like taking her away from the pain.
She floated inside her own body as if it was a warm bath
while the Marine sliced open her parka with a very sharp knife
and squeezed cold pink goo into the hole der needle gun had made.
She supposed she was lucky it had been an armor-piercing round.
She didn't think the Marine would have enough goo to fill
the hole that the other kind would have made.

*«unanticipated / unforeseen»*

"Oh there you are."
She didn't know if she had said the words out loud or not.
*Don't suppose you could lend a hand?*

*«inspection»*

The machine thought was clouded and soft-edged instead of crystal clear.
Without warning she was suspended beside a schematic of herself,
alone in a pocket universe constructed solely for this temporary purpose.
The fractalized patches of cells scattered through her body glistened blue-white,
but there and there and there they were red,
red for danger,
red like the blood on the work table underneath her.
They would heal—the tweaks in her genes were quadruply redundant to make sure of that—but
healing would take time
and that was something she/they/the world didn't have enough of right now.

"Sh sh sh," the Marine said softly.
An armored hand brushed gently against her cheek.
Her last thought before all her thoughts went away was,
*Honesty?*
