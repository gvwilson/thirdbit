# Iffy

## Chapter 1

Iffy,
a teenage girl living in Antarctica 200 years from now,
wakes from a nightmare in which she relives the sinking of her cloned family's fishing boat
in a deep-sea methane boil years earlier.
She now lives aboard the *Guinevere*,
another fishing boat belonging to foster parents she calls Aunt Naggie and Uncle Jack.
The former loves her fiercely,
while the latter is a borderine-abusive drinker and gambler.

Iffy goes on deck for fresh air and to look at Halley,
the small port where they are docked.
While looking longingly at the new machine shop the townspeople are building,
she wishes again that she knew why designs for machines she has never seen sometimes pop into her head.
(She worries it is a signa that she has been infected by the AIs that now control much of the planet.)

Aunt Naggie sends Iffy into Halley to buy groceries (and to get her away from Uncle Jack for a while).
Iffy uses the opportunity to visit Mister Mishra's machine shop,
where she has an awkward encounter with Jeep,
a teenage boy who used to be a friend
but who is still recovering from the trauma of being imprinted for military service.
Jeep and his family are refugees from Bharati,
another Antarctic town that was destroyed in a fire years earlier.

She then visits the Sandhus' grocery store,
where she is given some of their special curry powder.
She then meets a newcomer named Johnson Wales
who just arrived aboard an Aussie ship called the *Taroona*.
Wales says that the Aussies stole his tools,
and the two strike up a conversation about machinery.

## Chapter 2

Iffy hurries back to the *Guinevere* and tells her foster parents
that Wales might be willing to take her on as his apprentice.
Uncle Jack scoffs,
but Aunt Naggie tells Iffy that if she gets a chance to leave she should take it.

An explosion at the new machine shop pulls Iffy back into Halley.
She reaches the site in time to witness a standoff
between the local Marines and Aussie crew of the *Taroona* led by Captain Kerse.
As tensions rise,
Wales bumps into her and asks her to carry one of his toolboxes.
Some Aussie sailors chase them as they hurry away,
only to be tripped up by some of the enhanced raccoons that skulk around Halley.
Wales rewards the raccoons,
and admits to Iffy that he engineered the explosion in order to recover his tools.

Wales leaves his tools in the room he has rented
with a robotic teddy bear as a guard
and visits the *Guinevere* with Iffy.
There,
he asks for passage to the larger port of Rothera,
in exchange for which he will give Uncle Jack satellite images of the fishing grounds
that no one else can access any longer.
They strike a deal,
but someone's attempt to break into Wales' room forces an immediate departure.

## Chapter 3

Wales and Iffy do minor repairs to the *Guinevere* together as they sail to Rothera.
They are halfway there when another ship begins to chase them.
Wales quickly assembles a reconnaissance drone from parts in his toolboxes,
attaching a small cylinder to it "just in case".
The other ship is the *Taroona*,
which is no longer bothering to conceal its weapons.

Wales steers them toward an unstable patch of sea floor.
As the *Taroona* crosses over it,
his drone dives into the ocean and explodes,
triggering an undersea mudslide that in turn triggers a methane boil.
The *Taroona* manages to ride it out,
only to be sunk by a missile fired by Zillion (Brazilian) zealots hiding nearby.

## Chapter 4

As the *Guinevere* continues on its way to Rothera,
a spotter drone sent by the town takes station overhead.
(Conversation reveals that the AIs that control much of the planet
shoot down any flying thing that is too large or moving too fast,
which has essentially put an end to human air travel.)

Upon arrival they see the Antarctic Navy's warship *Bengal* at dock.
They are met by a squad of Marines and by Doctor Johel,
an old woman who clearly has history with Wales.
Doctor Johel takes them to meet Rothera's governor,
who is a clone of the one in Halley.
The governor's conversation with Wales is cut short when
some of the robots guarding the mansion go rogue and attack.
They flee into tunnels under the mansion,
where an injured Wales tries to cobble together a robot to defend them.
Iffy is able to finish the robot thanks to one of her strange visions,
but passes out under the strain.

She wakes up in hospital.
In the bed next to hers,
Wales explains to the governor and Doctor Johel that
a secret underground base in the interior of Antarctica
is now accessible thanks to ice melt,
and that it would give them control over the last remaining satellite network.
The governor agrees to send an expedition to check it out.

## Chapter 5

The next day,
Aunt Naggie and Iffy go into Rothera.
Iffy leaves Aunt Naggie at the market to shop so that she can visit Honesty,
another clone teenager that she has a crush on.
Honesty's olders are aware of Iffy's strange ability but not bothered by it.
Honesty tells Iffy that she is being called up for induction the next day;
when Iffy leaves,
the family give her a salvaged set of dronelets as a present.

Iffy returns to the market in time to see Aunt Naggie talking to a man Iffy has never seen before.
It is clear from their interaction that they have feelings for each other,
but before Iffy can ask any questions
a squad of Marines arrive and begin searching the market.
The man disguises himself and slips away,
telling Aunt Naggie he'll meet her later.
She and Iffy go to the rendezvous,
but he doesn't show.
They return to the *Guinevere* and an angry Uncle Jack.

That night,
Iffy has another nightmare.
Aunt Naggie wakes her and gives her a dose of curry powder,
which she reveals is actually a tailored medicine.
She has been getting it from Edson,
the man Iffy saw earlier,
who knew Iffy's olders.

## Chapter 6

Marines show up the next morning to guard the *Guinevere*.
Iffy and Wales distract themselves by building a small drone
around one of the dronelets that Honesty's olders gave her.
It it shot down on its maiden flight by one of the Marines,
after which Iffy tells Wales that she briefly had a pet baby raccoon when she was younger.
She and Jeep Mishra swap text messages about the after-effects of military imprinting,
which Honesty is going through that day.

That night,
a voice in Iffy's head asks her to help build a machine.
When she asks who she's talking to,
she is overwhelmed by a flood of images and sensations from enhanced creatures all across Antarctica.
Waking,
she goes on deck to find a raccoon trying to assemble an antenna.
She helps,
then returns to bed.
When she wakes a second time she speaks with Wales,
thinking that the antenna is somehow his,
but he has no idea where it came from.

Rothera's alarms go off as they are speaking.
The governor announces that his counterpart in Halley has invited the Aussies to take over the port,
so he has no choice but to make an alliance with the Zillions.
His announcement is cut short by an attack,
during which Iffy somehow take control of the Marines' railgun to stop it from shooting Aunt Naggie.
Wales dives into the frigid harbor to rescue a drowning Marine;
in doing so,
he reveals that he is unnaturally strong and apparently unaffected by the cold.

The Marines take Iffy, Wales, and Aunt Naggie into the center of Rothera,
where they see the damage from the attack
and bump into Honesty,
who has been imprinted with the skills and personality of a long-dead Marine.
They meet with Doctor Johel,
who tells Wales that they must accelerate their plan to induct Iffy as well
to take advantage of her special abilities.
Wales apologizes to Iffy for betraying her.

## Chapter 7

Iffy is taken to a hospital for induction.
There,
she sees Captain Kerse,
who is the only survivor of the sinking of the *Taroona*.
The captain blames Wales for what happened and promises Iffy that she will find him and make him pay.

Iffy makes a bargain with the voice in her head to escape.
Edson then shows up and smuggles her out to meet some raccoons and Wales,
who apologizes again for betraying her but claims he had to in order to deceive Doctor Johel.
The threesome make their way back to the *Guinevere* through the tense town.
Thanks to the antenna that Iffy helped assemble the night before,
they are able to flee the harbor,
leaving Uncle Jack behind.
Wales reveals that Iffy's original was engineered to be able to talk directly to the AIs,
and that if they can get to the underground base,
she will be able to use this ability to fix some of what's broken with the world.

## Chapter 8

As the *Guinevere* sails to Halley it is joined by the *Bengal*
under the command of Doctor Johel,
who explains that she would rather take her chances with Wales and the Aussies
than with the Zillions.
Johel has brought Captain Kerse to smooth things over with the Aussies;
once again she threatens Wales with revenge.
She has also brought Honesty to give her leverage with Iffy.

As two ships sail through a drift of dead jellyfish
they are attacked by small Zillion ships intent on sinking the *Bengal*
rather than letting the ship fall into Aussie hands.
Honesty is wounded;
Wales tries to stop Iffy from helping der,
saying that she is too important and that he has a way to get them off the *Guinevere*,
but then Zillion drones begin circling overhead.
Wales realizes that they are trying to draw fire from orbit to destroy both ships.

Iffy and Wales use her dronelets and some canvas to jury-rig a decoy,
which fools the satellites overhead into destroying one of the Zillion ships.
They then perform first aid on Honesty.
Exhausted,
Iffy falls asleep beside her friend
and takes part in a dream-like argument with two entities about her future.
When she wakes,
she joins Aunt Naggie, Edson, and Wales in the pilot house.
They tell her that a storm is coming,
and that the Aussies have rejected Wales' proposed deal
and plan to arrest him when the *Guinevere* arrives in Halley.

Iffy helps prepare the ship for the storm.
By the time it is past,
Wales and his toolbox are nowhere to be found.
Aunt Naggie breaks the news to Doctor Johel and Captain Kerse,
who are furious.

## Chapter 9

The *Guinevere* arrives in Halley.
Doctor Johel takes Iffy, Edson, and Aunt Naggie to meet the port's governor,
who tells them that their mission to the secret base will leave in a couple of days.
The next morning,
Iffy visits Jeep and patches up their friendship,
but isn't allowed into the hospital to see Honesty.

As Iffy wanders Halley's streets,
she encounters a raccoon who reminds her of their bargain.
Later,
she sees an old picture of Doctor Johel with the governors in Bharati,
the town that was destroyed by fire.
She then receives a mental plea for help from the raccoons,
who are being hunted as vermin by Aussie bots.
She saves them by pretending that they are her pets,
but upon her return to the mansion is summoned to meet Doctor Johel,
who reveals that she knows Iffy is able to talk to machines.
The governor appears during the argument that follows,
and Iffy discovers that Doctor Johel has been able to control the governors all along.
Iffy then tries to flee the mansion,
but is captured.

## Chapter 10

The point of view shifts to Sandrine Kibbens,
a long-dead soldier whose personality has been imprinted on Iffy's.
Doctor Johel hopes that Kibbens will be able to master Iffy's abilities,
and will use them on Doctor Johel's behalf.
Kibbens is subjected to mild torture to try to achieve a breakthrough,
but without results.
Later,
while resting,
she has a short mental conversation with Iffy.

The torture resumes the next day.
A conversation with one of her guards reveals that the fire in Bharati was no accident,
but was instead Doctor Johel using the governors of Halley and Rothera to eliminate their third clone.
Iffy reveals that Kibbens' personality has also been imprinted on Honesty,
and that after the recording was made,
Kibbens was tried for war crimes but also saved civilians from disaster.
Kibbens then tries to take full control of Iffy's body.

An hour later,
Kibbens tells Doctor Johel that her attempt was successful,
and proves it by making an origami giraffe.
She is then told to repair a damaged sentry bot as a further test,
and uses the opportunity to engineer an escape.
A flashback reveals that she and Iffy struck a deal during their mental conversation.

## Chapter 11

Iffy/Sandrine race to a hovercraft depot,
where they steal steal a stealthed reconnaissance hovercraft.
Sandrine's personality fades away,
and Iffy escapes into the backayonder.

Hours later and hundreds of kilometers away,
she meets up with Edson in a utility truck hauling fuel cells,
who was told when and where to find her by the raccoons.
Edson reveals that he is a Shepherd:
a human ally of the hybrid animal/machine consciousness
that it slowly growing in Antarctica and elsewhere,
and that is distinct from the machine consciousness that humanity warred with.

Iffy and Edson travel toward the secret base,
but have to abandon the truck and blow it up when they are pursued.
They hide for several days in one of the Shepherds' underground bunker,
then continue on foot toward the secret base.
Part-way there they meet a heard of enhanced musk ox,
who shield them from surveillance for the next leg of their journey.

## Chapter 12

The herd bring Edson and Iffy to a sheltered valley
where the Shepherds are cultivating bees, trees, and other wildlife.
Their rest is cut short by the arrival of a squad of Marines and a heavy-duty hovercraft.
The wildlife detonate some geothermal turbines to defeat the Marines,
while Iffy takes mental control of a spotter drone to lead the hovercraft away.
Despite this,
they are captured by Doctor Johel,
who is in command of the hovercraft.
Edson attempts to brainwipe himself to protect the Shepherds' secrets,
but Iffy prevents it.

## Chapter 13

Iffy and Edson are imprisoned aboard the hovercraft.
Iffy uses her abilities to engineer their escape.
She then refashions their escape pods into a parawing,
which she and Edson use to fly away.
They make their way to the entrance to the secret base,
where they encounter a polar bear.

## Chapter 14

The polar bear and its companions are enhanced,
and are members of the animal/machine consciousness.
They and Edson set out to hold off Doctor Johel's forces
while Iffy descends into the secret base.

There,
Iffy finds the remains of one of the base scientists
and a recording which reveals that they were attempting to take control of the machine consciousness.
She also finds pictures of Wales, Doctor Johel's father,
and the original from which she and her olders were cloned.
After repairing some sentry bots
whose programming has partly merged with that of the animal consciousness over the years,
she and the bots use tunnels to reach the base's main lab.
They are attacked en route by Marines,
but Iffy and one of the sentry bots still manage to reach the lab.
Just when Iffy thinks she is safe,
Doctor Johel and Captain Kerse arrive and capture her.

Doctor Johel reveals that the base contains quantum particles entangled with the AI's programming,
and that using these is humanity's last hope to regain control of the AI.
As a clone of one of the project's original scientists,
Iffy is the only one who can interface with these particles,
which is why she has been able to talk to the machines.
Iffy tries to explain that the machines humanity warred with
are separate from the hybrid animal/machine consciousness in the raccoons and other creatures,
but Doctor Johel doesn't care:
she wants Iffy to take control of the AI.

## Chapter 15

Doctor Johel turns on the machinery that will activate the quantum particles.
As it warms up,
Wales appears and tries to stop her.
Captain Kerse and Doctor Johel are both killed during the fight that follows,
but Wales is unable to prevent the quantum interface from forming.

Iffy re-enters the virtual dream world,
where she has a conversation with both the AI and the (immature) animal/machine hybrid.
The AI tells her that it is leaving,
but wants to make sure that its child will be all right.
It tells Iffy that she can't change the past,
but she *can* change the future,
and that it will be up to her to incorporate humanity into the new order.
Iffy says she will do her best,
and asks if the machines will let people fly again.

She returns to the real world to find some raccoons tending to a comatose Wales.
They promise to help him heal,
then lead Iffy back to the surface and Edson.
Together,
they fly an old plane to Halley
and reunite with Honesty, Jeep, and Aunt Naggie.
The story ends as Iffy is about to make her first address to the governors,
the Aussies,
and the Zillions.
