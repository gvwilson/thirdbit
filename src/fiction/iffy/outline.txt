# Iffy

## Chapter 1

Iffy,
a teenage girl living in Antarctica 200 years from now,
wakes from a nightmare in which she relives the sinking of her family's fishing boat when she was a child.
She now lives aboard the *Guinevere*,
another fishing boat belonging to foster parents she calls Aunt Naggie and Uncle Jack.
The former loves her fiercely,
while the latter is a borderine-abusive drinker and gambler.

Iffy goes on deck for fresh air and to look at Halley,
the small port where they are docked.
While looking longingly at the new machine shop the townspeople are building,
she wishes again that she knew why designs for machines she has never seen sometimes pop into her head.

Aunt Naggie sends Iffy into Halley to buy groceries (and to get her away from Uncle Jack for a while).
Iffy uses the opportunity to visit Mister Mishra's machine shop,
where she has an awkward encounter with Jeep,
a teenage boy who used to be a friend
but who is still recovering from the trauma of being imprinted for military service.
She then visits the Sandhus' grocery store,
where she is given some of their special curry powder.
She then meets a newcomer named Johnson Wales
who just arrived aboard an Aussie ship called the *Taroona*.
Wales says that the Aussies stole his tools,
and the two strike up a conversation about machinery.

## Chapter 2

Iffy hurries back to the *Guinevere* and tells her foster parents
that Wales might be willing to take her on as his apprentice.
Uncle Jack scoffs,
but Aunt Naggie tells Iffy that if she gets a chance to leave she should take it.

An explosion at the new machine shop pulls Iffy back into Halley.
She reaches the site in time to witness a standoff
between the local Marines and Aussie crew of the *Taroona* led by Captain Kerse.
As tensions rise,
Wales bumps into her and asks her to carry one of his toolboxes.
Some Aussie sailors chase them as they hurry away,
only to be tripped up by some of the enhanced raccoons that skulk around Halley.
Wales rewards the raccoons,
and admits to Iffy that he engineered the explosion in order to recover his tools.

Wales leaves his tools in the room he has rented
with a robotic teddy bear as a guard
and visits the *Guinevere* with Iffy.
There,
he asks for passage to the larger port of Rothera,
in exchange for which he will give Uncle Jack satellite images of the fishing grounds
that no one else can access any longer.
They strike a deal,
but someone's attempt to break into Wales' room forces an immediate departure.
