# Iffy

## Chapter 1

Iffy,
a teenage girl living in Antarctica 200 years from now,
wakes from a nightmare in which she relives the sinking of her cloned family's fishing boat
in a deep-sea methane boil years earlier.
She now lives aboard the *Guinevere*,
another fishing boat belonging to foster parents she calls Aunt Naggie and Uncle Jack.
The former loves her fiercely,
while the latter is a borderine-abusive drinker and gambler.

Iffy goes on deck for fresh air and to look at Halley,
the small port where they are docked.
While looking longingly at the new machine shop the townspeople are building,
she wishes again that she knew why designs for machines she has never seen sometimes pop into her head.
(She worries it is a signa that she has been infected by the AIs that now control much of the planet.)

Aunt Naggie sends Iffy into Halley to buy groceries (and to get her away from Uncle Jack for a while).
Iffy uses the opportunity to visit Mister Mishra's machine shop,
where she has an awkward encounter with Jeep,
a teenage boy who used to be a friend
but who is still recovering from the trauma of being imprinted for military service.
She then visits the Sandhus' grocery store,
where she is given some of their special curry powder.
She then meets a newcomer named Johnson Wales
who just arrived aboard an Aussie ship called the *Taroona*.
Wales says that the Aussies stole his tools,
and the two strike up a conversation about machinery.

## Chapter 2

Iffy hurries back to the *Guinevere* and tells her foster parents
that Wales might be willing to take her on as his apprentice.
Uncle Jack scoffs,
but Aunt Naggie tells Iffy that if she gets a chance to leave she should take it.

An explosion at the new machine shop pulls Iffy back into Halley.
She reaches the site in time to witness a standoff
between the local Marines and Aussie crew of the *Taroona* led by Captain Kerse.
As tensions rise,
Wales bumps into her and asks her to carry one of his toolboxes.
Some Aussie sailors chase them as they hurry away,
only to be tripped up by some of the enhanced raccoons that skulk around Halley.
Wales rewards the raccoons,
and admits to Iffy that he engineered the explosion in order to recover his tools.

Wales leaves his tools in the room he has rented
with a robotic teddy bear as a guard
and visits the *Guinevere* with Iffy.
There,
he asks for passage to the larger port of Rothera,
in exchange for which he will give Uncle Jack satellite images of the fishing grounds
that no one else can access any longer.
They strike a deal,
but someone's attempt to break into Wales' room forces an immediate departure.

## Chapter 3

Wales and Iffy do minor repairs to the *Guinevere* together as they sail to Rothera.
They are halfway there when another ship begins to chase them.
Wales quickly assembles a reconnaissance drone from parts in his toolboxes,
attaching a small cylinder to it "just in case".
The other ship is the *Taroona*,
which is no longer bothering to conceal its weapons.

Wales steers them toward an unstable patch of sea floor.
As the *Taroona* crosses over it,
his drone dives into the ocean and explodes,
triggering an undersea mudslide that in turn triggers a methane boil.
The *Taroona* manages to ride it out,
only to be sunk by a missile fired by Zillion (Brazilian) zealots hiding nearby.

## Chapter 4

As the *Guinevere* continues on its way to Rothera,
a spotter drone sent by the town takes station overhead.
(Conversation reveals that the AIs that control much of the planet
shoot down any flying thing that is too large or moving too fast,
which has essentially put an end to human air travel.)

Upon arrival they see the Antarctic Navy's warship *Bengal* at dock.
They are met by a squad of Marines and by Doctor Johel,
an old woman who clearly has history with Wales.
Doctor Johel takes them to meet Rothera's governor,
who is a clone of the one in Halley.
The governor's conversation with Wales is cut short when
some of the robots guarding the mansion go rogue and attack.
They flee into tunnels under the mansion,
where an injured Wales tries to cobble together a robot to defend them.
Iffy is able to finish the robot thanks to one of her strange visions,
but passes out under the strain.

She wakes up in hospital.
In the bed next to hers,
Wales explains to the governor and Doctor Johel that
a secret underground base in the interior of Antarctica
is now accessible thanks to ice melt,
and that it would give them control over the last remaining satellite network.
The governor agrees to send an expedition to check it out.

## Chapter 5

The next day,
Aunt Naggie and Iffy go into Rothera.
Iffy leaves Aunt Naggie at the market to shop so that she can visit Honesty,
another clone teenager that she has a crush on.
Honesty's olders are aware of Iffy's strange ability but not bothered by it.
Honesty tells Iffy that she is being called up for induction the next day;
when Iffy leaves,
the family give her a salvaged set of dronelets as a present.

Iffy returns to the market in time to see Aunt Naggie talking to a man Iffy has never seen before.
It is clear from their interaction that they have feelings for each other,
but before Iffy can ask any questions
a squad of Marines arrive and begin searching the market.
The man disguises himself and slips away,
telling Aunt Naggie he'll meet her later.
She and Iffy go to the rendezvous,
but he doesn't show.
They return to the *Guinevere* and an angry Uncle Jack.

That night,
Iffy has another nightmare.
Aunt Naggie wakes her and gives her a dose of curry powder,
which she reveals is actually a tailored medicine.
She has been getting it from Edson,
the man Iffy saw earlier,
who knew Iffy's olders.

## Chapter 6

Marines show up the next morning to guard the *Guinevere*.
Iffy and Wales distract themselves by building a small drone
around one of the dronelets that Honesty's olders gave her.
It it shot down on its maiden flight by one of the Marines,
after which Iffy tells Wales that she briefly had a pet baby raccoon when she was younger.
She and Jeep Mishra swap text messages about the after-effects of military imprinting,
which Honesty is going through that day.

That night,
a voice in Iffy's head asks her to help build a machine.
When she asks who she's talking to,
she is overwhelmed by a flood of images and sensations from enhanced creatures all across Antarctica.
Waking,
she goes on deck to find a raccoon trying to assemble an antenna.
She helps,
then returns to bed.
When she wakes a second time she speaks with Wales,
thinking that the antenna is somehow his,
but he has no idea where it came from.

Rothera's alarms go off as they are speaking.
The governor announces that his counterpart in Halley has invited the Aussies to take over the port,
so he has no choice but to make an alliance with the Zillions.
His announcement is cut short by an attack,
during which Iffy somehow take control of the Marines' railgun to stop it from shooting Aunt Naggie.
Wales dives into the frigid harbor to rescue a drowning Marine;
in doing so,
he reveals that he is unnaturally strong and apparently unaffected by the cold.

The Marines take Iffy, Wales, and Aunt Naggie into the center of Rothera,
where they see the damage from the attack
and bump into Honesty,
who has been imprinted with the skills and personality of a long-dead Marine.
They meet with Doctor Johel,
who tells Wales that they must accelerate their plan to induct Iffy as well
to take advantage of her special abilities.
Wales apologizes to Iffy for betraying her.

## Chapter 7

Iffy is taken to a hospital for induction.
There,
she sees Captain Kerse,
who is the only survivor of the sinking of the *Taroona*.
The captain blames Wales for what happened and promises Iffy that she will find him and make him pay.

Iffy makes a bargain with the voice in her head to escape.
Edson then shows up and smuggles her out to meet some raccoons and Wales,
who apologizes again for betraying her but claims he had to in order to deceive Doctor Johel.
The threesome make their way back to the *Guinevere* through the tense town.
Thanks to the antenna that Iffy helped assemble the night before,
they are able to flee the harbor,
leaving Uncle Jack behind.
Wales reveals that Iffy's original was engineered to be able to talk directly to the AIs,
and that if they can get to the underground base,
she will be able to use this ability to fix some of what's broken with the world.
