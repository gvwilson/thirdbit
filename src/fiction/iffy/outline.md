# "Iffy"

-   *[Iffy](../)* is a YA novel about a teenage girl living in Antarctica 200 years from now.
-   Orphaned as a child, she has grown up with foster parents on a fishing boat that is just barely scraping by.
-   As her world edges closer to war,
    a chance encounter throws her into a conspiracy that reveals secrets about her past and identity.
-   Themes:
    -   We can't change the past: all we can do is fight for a better future.
    -   We don't have to be who other people think we're supposed to be.
-   Aim for 90,000 words (15 chapters of 6000 words each)
-   Should there be a backgrounder/interlude at the end of every chapter
    so that the few I really want don't seem weird?

## Background

-   The story opens 200 years in the future and roughly 150 years after the Melt.
    -   Climate change has made large parts of the world uninhabitable.
    -   Overfishing and desperate experiments gone wrong wreaked havoc on ocean life.
    -   AI became autonomous and closed the skies (no air travel or access to space).
    -   Cloning has become commonplace (partly to pass on expensive genetic tweaks).
-   Antarctica is home to half a million people, most in a handful of settlements where the ice has melted.
    -   Halley: a small fishing port (about 20,000 people).
    -   Rothera: Antarctica's largest city (about 100,000 people) and home to one of the world's last active coal mines.
    -   Paddington South: mentioned but not visited.
    -   Bharati: ravaged by fire twenty years ago and (supposedly) abandoned.
-   Governed by clones of Governor Stern named after their locations (e.g., Governor Stern Rothera).
    -   Halley, Rothera, and Paddington South all have a governor; Bharati's (supposedly) died in the fire.
    -   Governors nominally answer to the United Nations Emergency Authority (UNEA) but are effectively independent.
    -   Unknown to most people, the clones have been jockeying for supremacy for decades.
-   Major foreign powers are the Common Republic of Australia (Aussies) and Grande Brazil (Zillions).
    -   Zillions are green zealots, but are being courted by Rothera's governor.
        -   Offering to shut down the coal mine in exchange for Zillion backing independence.
    -   Halley's governor is growing closer to the Aussies in response.
    -   Paddington South's governor is trying to be the balance of power.
-   Human struggles are overshadowed by fears of AI.
    -   The war during the Melt was short and one-sided.
    -   Major AIs are referred to as Nova Zembla and Singapore,
        but people don't really know what their relationship is or if they're separate (or even if they're truly conscious).
-   Anything large or fast that tries to fly doesn't last long.
    -   Limited access to old satellite networks (GPS and telecoms).
-   Humans make limited use of Hell (the internet) because of fears of what lurks there.
    -   And are very strongly opposed to surveillance.
    -   *This plot device keeps future human use of technology familiar to present-day readers.*
-   The interior of Antarctica (called the "backayonder") still has ice, but also now has large stretches of tundra.
    -   Populated by genetically engineered ("tweaked") life.
    -   And by autonomous bots and cyborgs that protect the "normal" creatures.
    -   Their human allies are called Ecologists: semi-mystical belief in the world remaking itself.
    -   Most people think the Ecologists are allied with the Zillions,
        but in reality they have very different visions:
        the Zillions want to put things back the way they were,
        the Ecologists accept that the world has to move on.
-   "Imprinting" temporarily overlays a stored personality over the subject's
    (or victim's, depending on your point of view).
    -   Used to put recordings of old Marines in new bodies temporarily for military service.
    -   Can have traumatic psychological effects over time.
    -   Use is very limited: only a few machines exist, and the equipment to make new recordings has been lost.
-   Ocean travel near Antarctica is dangerous because of "boils".
    -   Frozen methane clathrates on the sea floor melt and burst, releasing gas.
    -   Creates rich fishing but ships can sink when the water turns to foam.
    -   Note that "fishing" mostly means jellyfish: actual fish have become rare and sea-going mammals are all extinct.

-   Goals:
    -   Enter the Niobium base.
    -   Reveal Johel and Wales' plan to alter the past and that Iffy's real "first" was his colleague Jing-mei Yuen.
    -   Dr. Johel's death.

### Chapter 15 (day ??)

-   Goals:
    -   Iffy decides not to alter the past.
    -   Wales has a redemptive change of heart and sacrifices himself.
    -   GS Paddington's (well deserved).
    -   Iffy becomes ambassador between AI and humanity.
    -   End with Iffy messaging Jeep and Honesty: "we'll figure it out".

## FIXME

-   Why don't the AI help or hinder more?
-   Why doesn't Iffy message Honesty earlier?
-   Find out that Uncle Jack got rid of Iffy's pet raccoon.
-   Need to re-use Jeep.
-   What does the picture book mean?
-   Why aren't Edson and Iffy recaptured immediately by the governor's forces?
