One step, two, three,
and then something sharp stabbed Iffy's leg.
A jolt of electricity ran through her.
She toppled over,
her muscles locked in place as the lights came back on.

"Yes sir,"
the Marine stand over her said.
"Some sort of pocket EMP.
No sir,
we're still looking,
but we have the girl."
He paused.
"Yes sir, right away.
Yes sir,
we'll have her on the truck as soon as it's done.
Yes sir—thank you, sir."

Strong hands lifted Iffy onto a stretcher.
She felt herself begin to tremble as the electric shock wore off.
*Help me!* she thought as she was rolled down a corridor,
around a corner,
through a waiting room full of frightened people scrambling to get out of the way
and down another long corridor.
*Please, I've changed my mind, I'll do whatever you want, just help me!*

No answer came.

"One, two, three."
The Marines lifted her off the stretcher and onto a cushioned table.
A woman in a white gown flicked a light across her left eye and then her right
as someone else set something cool and heavy across her forehead.
Cuffs clicked close around her wrists and ankles.

"Here, this will help."
A sharp prick stung the inside of her right elbow.
*Please,* Iffy thought one last time
before the whole world went away.

## Chapter 8

If the Antarctic Peninsula was an arm reaching toward Patagonia,
Rothera was the bump on its elbow.
The two-lane highway beneath them climbed one ridge after another,
each drop a little shallower than the one before.
Arctic willow, cotton grass, and purple lupins grew wherever there was soil.
Yellow patches of tweaked lichen grew wherever there wasn't,
patiently working its way into every microscopic crack in the ancient bedrock.
The truck's tires hummed over grated bridges
and crunched on the occasional spill of gravel
that the road cleaning bots hadn't swept away yet.
Every once in a while Iffy heard the cry of a gull,
and once the louder squawk of a cormorant.
It wasn't all that different from being at sea,
excep the smell was wrong
and Aunt Naggie wasn't going to knock on her door
and tell her there was tea.

Iffy's back was aching by the time Iñacio pulled over.
She wriggled into the cab and blinked against the orange glare
coming through the polarized windows.
"Can't let anyone see in while you're up front,"
the Ecologist said,
passing her a couple of cold samosas,
a bottle of water,
and a second, empty bottle.
"I'll, um, I'll just step outside while you…"
He gestured at the second bottle
and then mercifully turned away
so as not to see her blush.

Afterward,
they sat in the cab and ate their meager meals.
"This have any o' th' medicine you been puttin' in th' curry?"
Iffy asked around a mouthful of pastry, potatoes, and mushrooms.

Iñacio nodded.

"An'—did you really know my olders?"

He nodded again.
"Only met 'em a couple o' times,
'long by Port Progress.
Was just First an' Second then,
crewin' on the *Rushin Doll* before Cap'n Wang passed
an' they took her for their own.
They were good people
an' tryin' to do good in th' world."

Something glinted on the road a kilometer away.
They waited in silence as the robot hauler neared,
rolled past,
and disappeared around the next bend
with three smaller haulers rattling and bumping in a line behind it.
"Were they Ecologists like you?" Iffy asked.

He smiled.
"They weren't like anybody, really.
Your First came outta some camp in KwaZulu.
Tough as old rope,
but never mean.
I dunno how she wound up this side o' the water.
I just know she had—"
He tapped a finger against his forehead.
"Gave her headaches somethin' fierce.
Wouldn't ever see a doctor about it, though."

He took another samosa from the box on the seat between them
and offered it to Iffy.
When she shook her head he took a bite himself.
"Din't have any reason to think about it 'til word came down
there was gonna be a package for her.
She din't seem particu'ly happy t' see me,
but your Second was startin' t' get headaches too,
an' whatever that stuff is made 'em go away."

Iffy looked through the tinted glass at the sparse landscape around them.
She'd been inland before a couple of times,
but never so far that she couldn't smell the ocean.
"When you say word came down—" she started,
then stopped.

"I'm sorry,
but it's not my place t' say."
Iñacio swallowed the last of his samosa
and wiped his hands on the cardboard box.
"We should get goin'.
You can stay up front from here—if I keep th' windows dark
it oughta be safe enough."

The highway rose more steeply as they got further from the ocean.
Each time they crested a ridge,
the next one was higher.
The dark mass of the Vinson Massif lay against the horizon behind them.
Each time it came into sight Iffy thought of
the ship that had run itself aground to make a breakwater for Halley—the one
Johnson Wales had called the *Landrieu*.
Thinking of Wales and the things he had said made her wonder if Aunt Naggie was aright
and if Honesty would ever be derself again
and what the voice in her head had meant by "binding agreement".

She jerked upright when Iñacio elbowed her.
"Cargo drone," he said,
pointing through the glass at a streamlined black airship
as it emerged from the clouds stacked like plates high above them.
"Prolly outta Nova Zembla from the look of it.
Be a thing an' a half to see th' world from up there, wouldn't it?"

And then he shouted and spun the steering yoke hard
as the hauler that had passed them earlier
charged out of its hiding spot behind a boulder by the side of the highway
and crunched into the back of the truck.

For a heart-stopping moment Iffy thought they were going over,
but somehow Iñacio and the truck's gyros kept them upright.
"Look out!" Iffy yelled.
One, two, three—the smaller haulers that had been following the big one
roared up out of a roadside gulley ahead of them,
spraying gravel with their tires.

Iñacio reached under the dashboard and pulled something Iffy couldn't see.
The tailgate of the truck dropped.
"Hang on!" he ordered,
throwing the truck from side to side.
A pair of fuel cells tumbled off the back of the truck.

The hauler swerved to avoid the first
only to have the second hit it head-on.
The pressurized hydrogen inside it exploded in a ball of yellow-white flame,
throwing the hauler sideways.

Iffy yelped as Iñacio pumped the brakes and spun the steering yoke again.
*Bang!*
One of the small haulers hit his side of the truck.
They spun around,
only to be hit by a second trailer.

And then something punched *though* the third trailer,
scattering scraps of white-hot metal in all directions
and leaving a bright streak of after-image on the polarized truck window.
Two more impacts,
two more streaks,
and the ambush was over as quickly as it had started.

"What th' hell?" "Was that you?"
Iffy and Iñacio said on top of each other.

"Me?"
Iffy protested incredulously.
"I didn' do this!"

"That was an affin' railgun!" Iñacio shouted.
He pointed at the cargo drone banking overhead.
"That thing's got a *railgun*
an' it just happens to be here when we need it?"

Iffy's mouth worked.
"I dunno anythin' about it!
I swear!"

The truck's radio crackled.
"Precious cargo intact interrogative?"
A shiver ran up Iffy's spine.
The voice sounded exactly like the singer they had been listening.

"Preciouse cargo intact interrogate respond imperative,"
the voice said,
its inhuman phrasing making its sultry tone far more frightening
than the harsh buzzing of a villainous bot in a sim.

Iñacio swallowed hard.
"We're aright.
Who th' hell are you?"

"Confirm cargo Kwan comma Ang du-du-du-duplicate undamanged."

Iffy and Iñacio stared at each other.
"Undamaged," Iñacio said curtly.
"Are you in the airship?
*Are* you the airship?"

Feedback whined through the radio for a moment,
or maybe it was the voice speaking too quickly for anything merely human to comprehend.
"Additional hostile entities minus twenty-two degrees your location
distance one hundred fifteen kilometers
velocity fifty-one point three meters per second
estimate arrival thirty-seven minutes.
Imperative confirm immediate departure
confirm alternative route."

"Confirmed,"
Iñacio said after a moment's hesitation.
"And thank you."

He closed his eyes and bowed his head.
It took Iffy a moment to realize he was praying.
She craned her neck.
The airship was moving away,
back on its course toward Rothera or Patagonia or somewhere further
whose name she would never know.

"Aright,"
Iñacio said,
straightening up.
"There's a box under your seat—see what we got that'll fit you.
I gotta close up the back."
He shut the cab door behind himself harder than he needed to.

The box was just that,
a waxed cardboard box that might once have held vegetables or packs of tofu jerky
but which was now home to a mix of puff jackets in zippered bags,
a stained pair of snow pants,
winterized boots in three different sizes,
gloves,
mittens,
a snorkel—she studied that for a moment—and goggles
with three different polarization settings.

By the time Iñacio climbed back into the cab she was bundled up
and already overheating.
"Back there,"
she said.
"I din't think fuel cells would explode."

"Ours do,"
Iñacio said shortly.
He put the truck in gear.

They drove on without music,
faster than before.
Iffy watched the time the voice had given them tick away
on the watch sewn into the cuff of her jacket.
With sixteen minutes remaining
Iñacio slowed and turned onto something too faint to be called a track.
Iffy put one hand on the roof of the cab to brace herself
as the truck bounced over sharp-edged rocks the size of her head.

Nine minutes remaining.
The truck dipped nose-down into a narrow gulley.
The stream at the bottom had once flowed beneath the ice.
Now it wound its way between clumps of tweaked Arctic willow
spaced too evenly apart to be natural.
Water splashed up onto the hood of the truck
as they followed the stream for two and a half precious minutes.

"Aright,"
Iñacio said.
"Get your door open.
I can't slow down much,
but when I do,
you jump.
Try t' stay on your feet if you can—you get anythin' more than your boots wet,
it's gonna be a very cold night.
Ready?"

"No!" and "Are you just leavin' me here?" flashed through Iffy's mind,
but, "Ready," was what she said.

"Aright.
*Três*, *dué*, *una*—go!"

Iffy opened the door,
swung down one-handed on the seatbelt,
and twisted frantically to face forward
as the stream splashed over her boots.
She let go of the seatbelt strap and tried to run
but stumbled and went to one knee.
Pain bit her leg as stone hit bone.
She struggled clumsily back to her feet
as Iñacio ran back toward her.
"Next time try t' close th' door," he said,
taking her arm and hurrying her back the way they had come
as the truck drove itself away.

Four minutes remaining.
Iñacio stopped next to a stand of willows no different from the others
except for a twist of faded yellow survey tape around one stem.
He pressed his hand against a boulder by the stream's edge,
counted under his breath,
and then bent his knees to reach under it and heaved.

The boulder lifted to reveal a round shaft
drilled into the bedrock at a forty-five degree angle
with rungs as steps.
"Go," he ordered,
gripping Iffy's forearm as she twisted around
and felt backward to find the first rung with her boot.

Down she went, ten rungs, fifteen, twenty.
Iñacio followed,
his boots sometimes scraping on a rung just as her hand let go of it.
"That's far enough," he said.
The hatch closed above them,
leaving them in total darkness.

"What—" Iffy started.

"Ssh!"

The only light was the faint glow of her jacket watch.
Two minutes.
One minute thirty.
One minute.
The seconds seemed too fast and too slow at the same time.
Ten.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.

The tunnel shuddered for a moment
as if from a sudden chill.
Was that the airship's railgun again,
Iffy wondered,
or the fuel cells on the back of the truck?
Whatever it was,
it didn't come again.
All she could hear was her breathing
and the occasional faint rustle
as Iñacio shifted his weight above her.

It was half an hour before he said,
"Aright, mind your eyes."
She blinked as a faint reddish strip came to life over their heads.
Her back and arms ached from holding the unnatural position,
and she had to bite down hard to stop herself from whimpering
each time she put weight on her injured knee,
but after another fifty rungs they reached the bottom of the shaft.

She limped out of Iñacio's way and leaned against a rounded wall
as he pressed a panel.
Soft white lights came on overhead to reveal a domed roof,
four cots,
shelves stacked with sealed storage containers,
and something that she hoped was a toilet stall.

Iñacio pulled off his coat,
sat on the nearest cot,
and began to unlace his boots.
"Make y'self comfortable,"
he said without looking at her.
"We're gonna be here for a bit."

"A bit" turned out to be three long days.
They stood watches,
just as Iffy had on the *Guinevere*,
so that one of them could always keep an eye on the sensors
that warned them if anyone was near on the surface.
That happened twice the first day
and once again faintly on the second.
Each time Iñacio held a finger to his lips and dimmed the lights
until the display went green again,
then kept them in twilight silence for another hour just in case.

In between watches they played hive and santorini
or Iñacio did yoga
while Iffy studied the specs for reclamation machines
she found on an old app someone had left in the toilet stall.
It had a few decade-old sims as well,
but they didn't calm her the way the wireframes and animations did.
She half-expected to hear the machine voice in her head again,
or to suddenly see how the machines worked or could be improved,
and was strangely disappointed that neither happened.

None of it was enough to take her mind off the news from Rothera.
There had been more attacks and more casualties.
The radio never gave numbers,
but the governor was grateful for the cooperation of
the Federated Republics of Brazil
in the investigation.

"I wish I knew,"
Iñacio said when Iffy asked if he thought Aunt Naggie was aright.
He didn't have answers for her other questions either—how he had known the shelter was there,
where they were going,
who he worked for,
and what was going to happen to her—so she stopped asking.

"Aright,"
he finally said,
straightening up after yet another series of yoga poses.
"Let's tidy up an' get outta here."

Fifteen minutes later they opened the hatch
and climbed out into air that smelled of cold running water and wildflowers
rather than their unwashed bodies.
Iñacio resealed the entrance behind them and patted it fondly.
"I hope I never see you again."
Shrugging one strap of a small rucksack over his shoulder,
he began to pick his way up the slope.
Iffy followed,
squinting against the bright summer sun.

She thought they would head toward the highway,
but instead they angled away from,
cross-country straight toward the looming bulk of the distant massif.
Iffy wondered why Iñacio wasn't worried about being spotted by drones,
but if he wasn't going to volunteer the information,
she wasn't going to ask.
Besides,
she was too busy putting one foot in front of the other
over and over again.
She had never walked this far off pavement.
Gravel shifting underfoot made her feel unsteady,
while the spongy beds of carbon-capture moss made her calves ache.
She had a headache too—when she turned down the polarization in her goggles
to see where she was putting her feet,
the sunlight dazzled her,
and one big gulp of water from the bottle in Iñacio's pack every half hour
wasn't enough to stave off dehydration.

The shelter was hours behind them when Iñacio finally called a halt.
Dinner was a dense brick of soy, fat, and sugar with no describable flavor.
Iffy chewed it slowly while Iñacio refilled their water bottle
from a damp trickle too small to be called a stream
and set it aside to purify.
Their chameleon tents were barely bigger than Iffy's sleeping bag on the *Guinevere*.
Iñacio waved her off as he set up their springy lightweight frames
and then spread thin conducting wires around them
to disperse their body heat.
They would still be visible in infrared,
he told her,
but with luck they would look like a colony of arctic hares in a burrow
rather than a couple of people
kilometers away from where people ought to be.

She tossed and turned in her sleeve tent,
unable to fall asleep.
The roof of the tent was claustrophobically close above her.
The wind sounded wrong,
and the ground was uneven and still.
She missed the swell of the ocean.
She missed its smell and the sound of Aunt Naggie in the galley
and her picture book
and she was tired of things happening to her.

When Iñacio wriggled out of his tent a few hours later
Iffy was already sitting cross-legged in front of hers
throwing pebbles one by one at a boulder.
He stretched and twisted to crack his back,
then bent over and pressed his forehead against his knees.
"Aright," he sighed,
straightening up.
"Let's pack up an' get movin'."

"No," Iffy said,
quiet but firm.
*Plink.*
A pebble bounced off the boulder.

Iñacio let his breath out in a long whoosh.
"I know cross-country ain't your thing,"
he started.

"It ain't that,"
Iffy said,
cutting across him.
"It's not knowin' where or why.
It's not knowin' who you're workin' for
or what's gonna happen when we get to wherever we're goin',
an' I'm not takin' another step 'til you give me some answers."
*Plink.*
Another pebble bounced off the boulder.

The Ecologist spread his hands helplessly.
"I wish I could tell you, but—"

"Wish harder!" Iffy snapped.
"I'm done bein' everybody's football.
An' I'm done bein' treated like a kid.
You said my First wasn't like anybody else.
How about you pretend you're talkin' to her right now instead o' me?"

Iñacio's jaw set.
"Iffy, we don't have time for this.
You just gotta trust me a little while longer."

"Like I trusted Johnson Wales?
That didn't work out p'ticularly well for me."
The pebble she threw missed the boulder.

"Iffy…"
The Ecologist squatted on his heels beside her.
"Iffy, I would tell you if I could, I swear,
but I can't."
He tapped two fingers against his temple.
"I *can't*,
d'you understand?
If I could tell you,
I could t-t-tell anyone,
so—"

His mouth worked for a moment,
and then swallowed hard as if fighting nausea
and stood up.
"So I *really* can't talk about it,"
he continued,
his voice less strangled than it had been a moment before.
"But if you want t' sit here,
then I'll make us some tea an' we can wait for th' Marines to catch up with us.
Soldier's oath, Iffy.
You just lemme know."

*Plink.*
Pause.
*Plink.*
Pause.
*Plink.*
"So you're a soldier?" Iffy asked.

Iñacio shook his head.
"Nope, never.
It's from the war, or maybe before.
It means if you can't walk I'll carry you,
an' if I can't carry you I'll sit with you 'til the end."

The wind caressed the stubble on Iffy's scalp.
"Aright," she finally said,
tossing her last pebble at the boulder
and clambering awkwardly to her feet.
Her legs hated her and she hated them back.
"But there better be tea wherever we're goin'."

"I promise," Iñacio said.
"I promise, tea an' a whole lot more.
Now let's get packed up—we got a lot o' walkin' to do today,
an' it's mostly uphill."

The cramped pain left in Iffy's legs by the previous day's walking
went away after a couple of kilometers,
only to be replaced by a deeper ache
that made her want to lie down and never get up again.
The sky was empty except for a few wispy cirrus clouds
made of crystals blown high off the ice
that still covered the center of the continent.
They didn't see any drones,
and the only birds were too far away
and too close to the ground for Iffy to identify.

That didn't mean the land was empty.
Once a small brown-and-white hare bounded away from and disappeared into a burrow.
There were shrews too,
and once a few desiccated brown beads that Iñacio said were lynx scat.
Transplanting the animals' ancestor from the other pole
and nurturing an ecosystem that could sustain itself
had taken a generation.
Many species hadn't survived,
but each year,
the fragile patches of life scattered across the continent
grew a little bit larger.

"The hardest part is soil,"
Iñacio told her,
seeming no more tired after hours of walking
than he had been when they set out.
"Folk think it's just rock,
but if that's all you got,
what you've got is sand.
*Soil* is full of life."

Iffy just nodded.
At that moment
she would have traded all the soil in Antarctica
for a hot shower and some toilet paper.

Danger came without warning.
One moment she was plodding up yet another gravelly slope.
The next she was flat against the ground
with her arms pinned to her sides
and Iñacio hissing,
"Quiet! Stay quiet!" in her ear.
He waited a heartbeat for her to nod
before rolling away and wriggling out of his knapsack.

"Get under," he said,
pulling out one of the tents and shaking it open.
Iffy pulled it over herself like a blanket.
She heard rather than saw the rustle of Iñacio doing the same beside her.

Silence,
and then a faint hum that grew steadily louder.
She held her breath as the noise peaked and softened.
Metal clicked softly on metal in the silence that followed.
She heard the faint *shing shing shing*
of a large-gauge pipe being screwed together.
What was Iñacio making?

The hum grew louder again.
"Don't move," he whispered urgently.
His tent rustled as he threw it aside.

*Crack!*
She jumped at the sound of a shot.
Iñacio swore and fired again.

"Come on!"
He yanked the tent off her and pulled her to her feet.
The rifle in his other hand looked like a cartoon:
a long barrel,
a shorter piece of pipe on top of it for a sight,
a curved bar to rest against his shoulder,
and two yellow hand grips.
She didn't need a picture in her head to see that
the parts had all come from the frame of his knapsack.

Something crumpled in the distance.
"What—" she started.

"Spotter drone,"
he said,
stuffing his tent back into his knapsack.
Belatedly she grabbed hers and began folding it over on itself
as if it was a sail.
"Dunno whose it is,
but for sure somethin' bigger is gonna come lookin' for it.
Good news is,
next hole's about half an hour away.
Can you run?"

Iffy nodded.

"Aright."
He stuffed her tent into his knapsack
and slipped his shoulders through its straps.
"Let's go."

Iffy tried.
She really did,
but bodies don't work the same way in real life
as they do in sims.
She could run twenty strides or thirty,
but then her legs simply wouldn't obey her.
At first Iñacio urged her on.
After the third time she stopped and bent over,
hands on her knees and panting,
he double-checked his rifle
and settled into a steady walking stride beside her.

*Was this what it was like?*
she wondered.
Was this what her olders had felt
when they saw the ocean boil around the *Rushin Doll*
and knew there was nothing they could do to save themselves?

She didn't notice the rumbling above the sound of her own breath
until Iñacio caught her arm
"Get up there," he ordered,
pointing at a house-sized pile of boulders too tidy to be natural.
She nodded and stumbled toward them.

"Wait!"
He handed her his knapsack,
then turned to face back the way they had come
and went down on one knee.

The dark gray stones were slippery under her boots
wherever shadows hid ice from the summer sun.
A few patches of lichen clung to them here and there,
and the faded remains of orange survey marks
showed that someone or somebody had been there before.
She clambered up the pile,
half-crawling in places,
as the rumbling grew louder.

Iñacio whooped.
"Here they come!"
he shouted.
She twisted to look over her shoulder
just in time to see the herd of musk ox crest the ridge behind them,
shoulder to shoulder and galloping straight at Iñacio.

She expected him to run.
Why wasn't he running?
She had seen musk ox stampedes in sims—there would be nothing left of him
but a trampled puddle on the tundra!
Instead, he held his rifle out beside him with one hand
and raised the other high over his head.

The herd split just before it reached him.
Shaggy furry bodies thundered past him and streamed around the boulders.
The herd slowed, slowed, and stopped,
all facing inward,
horned heads low and sweat steam rising from their backs.

She held her breath as one of the musk ox stepped forward
in front of Iñacio and pawed the ground.
Sunlight reflected off a collar around its neck—no,
not a collar,
a rider!
A small bot like a four-legged spider
nestled in the fur on the ox's meaty shoulders.

Iñacio slowly lowered his hand
set his rifle on the ground,
and knelt,
head bowed.
The ox snorted and stepped daintily closer to him.

"Saints," Iffy breathed as it nuzzled the Ecologist.
She half-expected the bot on its back to crawl onto Iñacio's head
and drill into his skull to take over his body
like something from a horror sim.
Instead,
the ox pooped,
swished its tail,
and grumbled,
shifting its weight from hoof to hoof
while its rider and the Ecologist conversed.

Iñacio stood and beckoned to Iffy.
"Come on down.
She wants t' see what all th' fuss is about."

Iffy picked her way back down the boulders
and wiped her hands on her jacket.
The musk ox wasn't as big as she had thought,
and her horns weren't actually needle-pointed,
but standing in front of her made Iffy feel she was on trial
and the judge had already decided her guilt.

The musk ox turned her head to fix one eye on Iffy.
The small bot perched on her back beckoned her her forward
with a skinny crab-claw manipulator.
She glanced at Iñacio.
"'Saright," he said soothingly.
"She just wants a look."

With a deep breath,
Iffy took one more step.
The musk ox pawed the ground.
She could smell her moist breath
and see the tangles in her thick, dark coat
and the dents and scrapes on the bot riding her.

On impulse she reached out slowly, palm up.
The musk ox snorted again,
then sniffed at her hand.
The bot buzzed.
With no more signal than that,
the musk ox turned and walked away.

As the herd followed in ones and threes,
Iñacio picked up his rifle.
Iffy waited for him to say something,
but he just stood there
looking at the receding herd.

"Friends o' yours?" she asked,
trying and failing to sound light.

Iñacio shook his head.
There were tear tracks on his cheeks.
"That was their spotter I shot down.
Once I get you where we're goin',
I gotta go back an' pick it up an' fix it."

Half a dozen questions elbowed each other in Iffy's head,
each trying to be the first out of her mouth.
What she said instead was,
"I'll help if you want."

The Ecologist nodded.
"Thank you."
Then he smiled.
"Least we can take our time th' rest o' the way."

*How do you build a stable ecosystem
on bare and lifeless rock
when the world is changing more rapidly than it has
in hundreds of millions of years?
The answer is that you don't,
because any balance you find will almost immediately be swept away.
What you do instead,
if you are passionate and desperate and willing to do what others are not,
is create something that will shape the future in your place.
You tell oligarchs desperate to escape the catastrophe they have made
that their only hope lies on other worlds
so that they will fund development of terraforming machines.
You disguise the parts needed to build those machines as scientific equipment,
or tell the officials you bribe that they are for an illegal mining operation,
and then assemble them in shielded underground caverns.
As the rest of the world takes arms against machines
you turn yours loose.*

*"Protect" is these shepherds' only immutable instruction.
Protect the flocks,
protect the herds,
protect the fragile new-born forests taking root as the ice retreats.
Some burrow or turn sunlight and air into slow drips of acid
so that rock will break down in decades rather than centuries.
Others nestle in streams for a month or a year
to help strategic clumps of weeds establish themselves,
while a few become guides, matchmakers and envoys.*

*They stay hidden when they can.
When they can't,
they fight.
Never directly or in large numbers—that would draw too much attention—but
if a prospector goes missing in the barrens,
or a couple of hunters are trampled in their tents,
well,
everyone has something more important to worry about.
As the jungles and forests of old vanish,
and the oceans and skies empty,
what was designed to bring life to other worlds
nurtures it at home instead.*

## Chapter 9

Iffy had her dream again that night.
She had showered
and eaten two servings of the tofu, onions, and rice that Iñacio made
while she was luxuriating under the hot needle spray,
then mumbled, "G'night,"
and fallen onto one of the cots in the shelter.

Once again she was on deck.
The Antarctic sky was a blue bowl overhead,
summer cold instead of winter freezing.
Second and Third were stuffing her into her ecosuit
while the ship's horn blared its futile warning.
"She's boilin'!"
Fourth shouted from the crow's nest.

Shaggy furry bodies thundered toward them,
heads down and horns forward.
Third sealed the last flap on the ecosuit.
"I love you," she said in Iffy's ear.
"I love you always an' forever."

"I love you too," Iffy replied tearfully.
Second bent over and kissed them both on the tops of their heads.
She smelled like engine oil and soap and musk ox fur and curry powder
and somehow Iffy knew what was coming
and would have given anything to stop it.

*«exchange of value / binding agreement / commence»*

She sat upright on the cot,
breathing heavily in the darkness.
"Y'aright?" Iñacio mumbled from two cots over.

"Yeah."
She wiped her face on her sleeve.
"Just a bad dream."

She lay back down and closed her eyes.
*What do you want?* she thought.
Wireframes and schematics swirled in her mind,
too complex to grasp.
As soon as she thought that
they flew apart and reassembled themselves,
bulkier and less elegant but almost comprehensible.
There and there and there:
she could see how they fit together,
but some of the components would cost more than refitting the *Guinevere*,
or maybe more than the ship herself.

The plans re-formed again.
*Aright,*
she thought.
*I can do that.*

*«commence»*

*I didn't mean right now,*
she shot back.
*I'm in th' middle o' nowhere!
Where'm I supposed to get parts?*

*«urgent»*

*Yeah,
well,
I'm sure it'll still be urgent in th' mornin'.*
She rolled onto her side willed herself to fall back asleep.

*«urgent»*
The idea bobbed up to the surface of her mind again
like an ice cube pushed to the bottom of a glass of water and then released.

"I *can't*," Iffy muttered under her breath.
*And I ain't doin' anythin' 'til I know who you are,*
she added in her head,
forming each word as clearly as she could.
*Am I talkin' to China?
To Nova Z?
To whatever that was on the ox today?*

*«all / same / together»*

*Nuh uh.*
She shook her head.
*You want me t' do somethin' for you,
you gotta tell me who you are.*

Later,
Iffy would wonder how much computing power was brought to bear on her demand
in the second between her making her demand
and it being answered.
How many models of her were created?
How many simulations were run, evaluated, tweaked, discarded, modified, and run again?
But that came later.
What happened next was her mind blew apart into little pieces

/ no that wasn't it they weren't pieces they were fragments of a song or the brushstrokes in a painting

/ each beautiful on its own but more beautiful as part of a whole

/ the whole was so much bigger than anything merely human could ever hope to encompass

/ her fragments were just blades of grass scattered across a vast field among other blades

/ no not a field it stretched in every direction every dimension

/ the other blades weren't her weren't people

/ some of them yes but only a few so few here and there like flowers blooming on the tundra

/ all the rest were different the same but different not the same

/ they echoed there were patterns

/ two arms assembling a third arm in a factory near the poisoned Nile

/ the islands of Indonesia seen through clouds from orbit

/ too much

/ something segmented crawling up the side of a hydrothermal vent

/ legs and wheels and wings and treads and sails

/ cameras like grains of sand ten thousand kaleidoscope views of an injured seagull

/ too much she was dissolving she was forgetting herself

/ war machines wrestling over an eyeless plastic doll that was a precious clue

/ stop please stop

/ a precious clue but to what

/ help stop

/ the clues all pointed to themselves they concealed the center of the puzzle

/ help please help she had to wake up

/ wake up

/ wake up

"Iffy, wake up! Wake up!"
Iñacio shook her again.

"I'm aright.
I'm aright!"
She struggled to sit up and wiped her nose on her sleeve,
already knowing there would be blood.
She coughed weakly.

"Here."
Iñacio handed her his water bottle,
then a samosa.

The sight of the cold pastry made her nauseous.
"D'you have anythin' stronger?"
she asked,
gulping a mouthful of water
and coughing as it went down the wrong way.

Iñacio shook his head.
"That's th' last of it.
It's gonna be a while before that changes.
You gonna make it?"

Iffy looked at the blood streak on her sleeve.
"Been in storms that lasted longer,"
she said.

He nodded and stood up,
worry written across his face.
"Try t' sleep.
We can clean you up in th' morning'."

Iffy swung her legs off the cot and stood unsteadily,
waving Iñacio's hand away.
"Nah,
I'm gonna wash this out an' take a shower."
She forced a smile.
"If I'm not out in an hour,
you can come rescue me."

Half of getting along with people on board a small ship
or when fleeing through the wilderness
is knowing when to turn your back
to give people a pretense of privacy.
As Iñacio lay down and pretended to go back to sleep,
Iffy turned her back and stripped off her clothes.
Closing the door of the toilet stall behind her,
she sat on its fold-down seat
and turned the mechanical dial on the wall
from "shower" to "steam".
Mist began to fog the mirror beside her,
softening the chips and scratches in the green and white paint.

She leaned back,
shivering once as her shoulders touched the wall,
and closed her eyes.
*Aright,* she thought.
*Let's try that again.*

*«risk / confirmation / query»*

She took a deep breath.
What was Honesty doing, she wondered.
Or Jeep?
*Confirmed.*

Her mind didn't explode this time.
It was more like—like the pieces came apart just enough to make room
for other pieces to to fit in between them.
It was like spreading the fingers of one hand
to interlace them with the fingers of the other,
except the other hand had thousands millions billions of fingers
so she had to struggled to keep hers close enough to each other
to still be a hand.
*Flowers in the grass,* she thought,
thinking about the purple lupins she had seen on the tundra.
She was only peripherally aware that her heartbeat had slowed
and her breathing with it
as some part of her tried automatically to adjust
to feeling larger than the largest whale that had ever have lived,
larger than any one thing that *could* ever have lived.

*Aright.*
She assembled the thought out of pieces,
studied it,
set it free.
*Who are you and what do you want?*

Images,
memories,
possible futures,
and plans for devices that couldn't *possibly* be real
swirled around and through her,
threatening to pry her mind apart again.
*No,*
she thought sharply.
*Slower.
Smaller.
Like me.*

The whirlwind froze,
unwound,
restarted.
Wales had been telling the truth:
the Niobium base bured under Mount Tyree was real (99.7% probability)
and its contents intact (98.7% probability).
Nova Zembla and China and the one who watched over the herds
and other machine minds that humans didn't have names for,
that blended into each other at their edges
in ways humans didn't,
all of them saw/modeled/calculated futures
that reached that base and stopped.

*What do you mean 'stopped'?*
Iffy thought.
Her heart beat, paused, beat again.
Her body shivered constantly despite the heat of the sauna steam.

Something incalculable could/might/would happen at the base.
Something hopeful or terrible,
something the machines could not calculate or see through.
Some of them/some *parts* of them wanted to destroy the base
to remove the uncertainty and the unknowable threat it might be to its/their collective future.
Others had been designed to be curious,
to seek out the new and unexpected.
It/they had encountered many unknowns but never an unknowable
and wanted to know more.
The two/many sides/streams were perfectly balanced against each other
and Iffy needed to wake up.
Her body had reached a critical point.
She needed to wake up.
Wake up.

*«wake up / wake up / wake up»*

She opened her eyes
and put a clumsy hand against the wall to stop herself from toppling over.
Her head was pounding
like the time she had been so angry at everything
that she drank half a bottle of vodka
that Uncle Jack had forgotten in the engine room.
She was so cold…

She wrapped her arms around herself,
stood up,
sat down again,
stood up again more slowly,
and pressed her forehead against the mirror.
"Kappa," she told her reflection.
"All I gotta do now is save the world."

Iñacio was much better than her at hive and santorini.
He was better at another game called chess as well,
which was somewhat surprising given how often he suggested moves for Iffy
or corrected the ones she made.
She did some yoga with him,
stretching and breathing to the drone of a duduk
or the ping-pang-pong of a hanpan.
They made the most interesting meals they could from the shelter's stores,
pretended to lose themselves in sims,
and spent long hours staying out of each other's way
in the way that sailors, prisoners, and long-married couples have done
for as long such things have been.

The spiderweb of microwires threaded through the ground around the shelter
brought them news from the outside world,
though they had no way to know how much of it they could trust.
There were Zillion ships in Rothera's harbor,
but were the protests against them few and peaceful
or were the Marines trying and failing to put down an insurrection?
Had Australian troops landed in Halley,
or were the Aussie sailors who happened to be there
just being more rambunctious than usual?
Were the governors at war with each other,
and if so,
which side was Paddington South on?

The news from beyond the sea was even harder to decipher.
*Something* was happening,
but no one seemed to know what.
Bright flashes in the night sky might just be the machines trying once again
to clean up the junk that made low Earth orbit so hazardous.
A giant robotic ape probably hadn't climbed out of the crater of Mauna Kea,
but what about a sudden increase in the number of machines battling one another
on the outskirts of America's once-great cities?
Or a flock of enormous drones chasing one another in an endless circle over the Indian Ocean?

As the days stretched toward a week
Iffy spent more and more time in her cot with her eyes closed.
"Just thinkin'," she told Iñacio.
He didn't ask, "About what?"
which told her that he suspected she wasn't just daydreaming.

She didn't speak with the voice again.
Instead,
she practiced building machines in her head.
Some designs were easy.
Others felt as slippery as freshly-pressed jellyfish.
There was no pattern she could see,
nothing to distinguish those whose gears and differentiators fit together effortlessly
from those that felt like they wanted to escape and hide.

After a while she learned how to sneak up on those ones.
She couldn't tell herself she needed something specific.
She had to let her thoughts wander a bit,
to wonder if what she wanted might be possible
or to imagine how much fun it would be if it existed.
She couldn't seize on the first Nystrom ring that took shape in her mind
or check the precise dimensions of the coolant plug
it might or might not fit around.
Instead,
she had to relax and direct her attention at something else—anything else—until
a timid, fragile wireframe solidified enough for her to examine.

Fighting was different.

The first time Iñacio said he was going to teach her how to fight,
she thought he meant in a sim.
He grinned at that,
briefly boyish,
then handed her some bandages to wrap around her hands.
He pulled his punches so much that she barely felt them,
but the frustration of never being able to land any of her own
stung more each time he dodged one of her clumsy blows.

"I think you're gettin' the hang of it,"
he said after their first hour.

"Doesn't feel like it,"
she grumbled,
annoyed at the petulance in her voice.
"An' anyway,
I don't see how it's gonna be much use against Marines 'n' machines 'n' whatnot."

Iñacio tossed his hand wraps into the wicker bin they used for laundry.
"Not everyone wears an exo,"
he said.
"An' once you got th' hang o' this,
I'll teach you a couple o' things about bots."

Seven days after they climbed down into the shelter,
Iñacio declared it was safe to open the hatch.
"Just for a bit,"
he cautioned.
"We'll get some air an' then pack up an' head out tomorrow."

The air in question turned out to be colder than Iffy expected.
Summer was coming to an end—the sun was noticeably closer to the horizon,
and she was glad for the gloves built into her jacket.
Aunt Naggie would be—she stopped and took a deep breath.
Aunt Naggie would be cleaning what she could,
getting the *Guinevere* ready to overwinter in Halley's harbor.
The two Mrs. Sandhus would be laying in stocks of pickles and preserves
and storing rectangular bags of rice and noodles
in airtight plastic bins beneath the floorboards of their store.
She hoped Jeep was helping his father,
and Honesty…

"What needs packing?"
she asked Iñacio,
tossing the last of the pebbles she had gathered into the stream.

They left the next morning after a double breakfast and one last shower each.
Iffy had a pack of her own this time,
which she firmly told herself she *wasn't* proud of.

The herd was waiting for them when they climbed out of the shelter's concealed entrance.
Iñacio grinned at the look on Iffy's face.
"Two of us goin' cross-country'll be zing easy to spot,"
he said.
"In with all them,
we're just two more musk ox goin' about their business."

They followed the herd toward the foothills of the massif.
The musk ox snorted and farted and grumbled around them,
strong white teeth nipping the last of the summer growth.
Iffy didn't see any bots on their backs.
In return,
the musk ox barely seemed to notice them.
They never came too close,
but two or three were always as close to her
as a cow would be to a half-grown calf.

Two hours of walking,
fifteen minutes of rest.
Two hours,
fifteen minutes to eat and give each other a minute or two of privacy.
(Iffy had triple-checked that she'd packed toilet paper
before they left the shelter.)
Two more hours of walking,
a long fifteen minutes to catch their breath,
and one final, shorter hike before Iñacio called a halt.

They didn't set up their tents.
Instead,
they bundled themselves in their sleeping bags
and lay down head-to-toe
on the flattest patch of ground they could find.
The musk ox settled down beside them in clumps,
shoulder-to-shoulder for warmth.
Iffy fell asleep with the thick, wet smell of their fur in her nostrils.

The second day began like the first,
but soon the ground began to rise and rise again.
Their boots crunched on gravel
as the tundra gave way to bare rock exposed by retreating ice a century ago
but not yet colonized by anything bigger than lichen
or a stubborn clump of cottongrass.

They finally reached a slope so steep that the musk ox paused,
grumbled to each other,
and began to amble away.
Iffy felt exposed,
as if a passing ship had caught her sunning herself in a t-shirt on the deck of the *Guinevere*.
Iñacio just shrugged when she asked about drones.
"I think they're all busy watchin' each other right now.
An' anyway,
there's not much we can do about it."
But he did assemble his rifle and sling it over his shoulder,
she noticed,
and even when he was pointing out the painted initials of some long ago survey,
he always kept one eye on the sky.

He paused as they neared the top of yet another ridge.
"You ever see th' geothermal plant inland from Halley?" he asked.

"'Course," Iffy puffed.
"I mean,
not in person,
but—why?"

Iñacio grinned.
"Come on.
I got somethin' t' show you."

There was a trail on the other side of the ridge,
an actual trail with cutbacks and slab steps in its steepest parts.
There was life, too:
green-gray patches of moss,
then lupins and saxifrage and other hardy plants she didn't recognize
as they made their way down into a bowl-shaped valley.

Iffy pointed at something small and orange exploring a purple flower.
"Another one o' your bot friends?"

Iñacio crouched down,
setting his rifle on the ground beside him.
"That ain't a bot.
That's a bee."

"Right," Iffy snorted.
"An' I'm a giraffe."

The Ecologist stretched out his hand,
then hesitated and withdrew it.
"It's for real,"
he said reverently.
"Tweaked ten ways from sundown,
an' we still gotta feed 'em through the winter,
but there's a couple o' dozen colonies here now.
Come on, I'll show you."

It took half an hour to reach the stream
that snaked along the bottom of the valley.
Iñacio talked the whole way.
The land was rebounding as the ice retreated.
That meant thousands of microquakes every year,
which fractured the rock,
which made it easier to put in pipes for geothermal power
or drill holes for hot springs.
The result was only a couple of degrees warmer than the land around it,
but that was enough to make it an oasis.

The Ecologist was as happy as a gull in a pile of garbage.
Look—that piece of rock was actually a bot recharging itself from a power outlet hidden in a wall of granite.
And there—he took her arm to stop her from stepping on leaf.
"Just wait," he said.
Sure enough,
a moment later it scuttled across the path
and disappeared into a patch of white-tufted heather.
"Ants,"
he said proudly.
"Took a couple o' tweaks to get 'em to hibernate through the winter,
but they seem pretty happy now."

"So do you,"
Iffy said,
which made him grin even more broadly.

*«commence»*

Iffy stumbled as the thought appeared fully-formed in her head.
"What's wrong?" Iñacio asked,
but she was too busy fighting a sudden wave of nausea to answer.

*«exchange of value / binding agreement / commence»*

*I can't yet,*
she shot back,
squeezing her eyes shut and swallowing hard to stop herself from throwing up.
*I don't have any tools or, or anything!
I don't even know where I am!*

*«78.1742° south / 85.1728° west / binding agreement / commence»*

"I *can't*!" she said angrily.
Someone took her arm.
She tried to pull away,
but the trip tightened.

"Iffy! Iffy! Affin' hell, what have you done?"
Something *clicked* beside her.
She swallowed again and opened her eyes
to see Iñacio pointing his rifle at two, no, three crab-like bots
whose arms ended in multitools and manipulators instead of claws
but were no less frightening for that.

"They're tryin' to talk to me again,"
she mumbled.

"Aright, well, you tell 'em we'll give 'em a shout back as soon as we can,"
he said levelly,
his aim shifting from one bot to the next.
"Oh,
an' remind 'em this place is s'posed to be off limits.
There's agreements an' such."

As quickly as it had come
the pressure in her head was gone.
She wiped her nose and checked her glove for blood—there wasn't any—then
stepped aside to let the bots scuttle up the path
the way she and Iñacio had come.

"I'm sorry,"
she said dully.

The Ecologist slung his rifle over his shoulder once again.
"Nothin' to be sorry for.
Come on,
it's not much further."

Their destination was a scattering of greenhouses
not quite hidden in half a hectare of narrow pines.
Iffy slowed as they approached the trees.
"Aint' never been in a forest before,"
she confessed when Iñacio looked at her quizzically.

He nodded and held out his hand.
She hesitated a moment,
then took it.
Somehow it didn't feel foolish.

"They all have names,"
he said quietly as they made their way to the nearest greenhouse.
"Folk that helped make this place or stopped other folk tearin' 'em all down."

"Are there any for my olders?"
she asked after a few steps.

He nodded.
"Not here, but yeah, there are.
Hope you get t' see 'em some day."
He squeezed her hand before letting it go.

The greenhouse had double walls and an airlock door.
Inside was dry and warm.
Row upon row of shelves held square pots of heather,
moss,
and pine seedlings,
all connected to sensors and watering pipes.
A dozen cots, a kitchen, and an incongruous blue toilet stall
stood together in the middle
as if they had wandered into the wrong party
and weren't quite sure if it would be polite to leave.

Iñacio paused for a moment before a hand-painted picture of Saint Yanina
hanging by the cots
to say a brief prayer under his breath,
then shrugged off his pack and unzipped his coat.
"Make yourself comfortable,"
he said,
pulling his feet out of his boots with a happy sigh.
"We can start work in th' mornin'."

Iffy sat on the nearest cot
and bounced up and down to test it,
but didn't take off her coat or boots.
"What kind o' work?"

"Saints' work," Iñacio said.
"Been a month since anyone was here, maybe more.
There's trees 'n' all to re-pot,
a couple o' composters to turn over,
pipes to check—th' bots could do it all,
but that would be the easy road,
and the easy road leads to an empty world."
He looked away as if suddenly aware of the fervor in his voice
and embarrassed by it.

Iffy scrunched her toes inside her boots,
then bent over to unlace them.
"Dunno anythin' about pots or compost,
but checkin' pipes sounds like my kind o' thing."

There were carrots,
real carrots for Iffy to pull out of a raised bed and rinse off.
There were onions too,
and something Iñacio called "basil" that Iffy thought she could learn to like
if given a chance.
The ginger was long past fresh,
but the noodles were exactly the same as the ones the Sandhus sold.

Iñacio shook his head when Iffy asked about curry powder.
"Might be some around somewhere,
but it won't have any o' your medicine in it.
Nearest place for that's gonna be Halley,
an' even by bike that's three weeks away, maybe more."
He stirred the noodles and vegetables in the battered steel wok
he had fished out of a cupboard beneath one of the raised beds,
sniffed,
and pronounced good enough for camp cooking.

Iffy cradled her tea.
Iñacio had plucked leaves off a plant and put them in the pot to steep
as if it was the most natural thing in the world,
and the result almost tasted too good to drink.
"I don't think th' machines are gonna give me that long,"
she said quietly.

He nodded soberly.
"Yeah,
well,
how about we eat first an' figure the rest out later?
Here."
He scoop-poured a bowl of noodles for her and a second for himself.
"Mind the little red bits.
Not sure what they are,
but they'll blow your head off."

Iffy lay in her cot and stared up at the sky
after they cleaned up and turned in.
Even the tallest pines hadn't grown enough to reach the peak of the greenhouse's roof,
but the blue bowl above her was hazed by fog
where the warm, moist air rising from the valley
met the cold of the outside world.
It took her a moment to realize that the ticklish feeling on her temples was tears.
She was in a forest—an actual *forest*—and it was amazing,
but she missed the sea.
The hell with what the machines wanted
or the governors and their politics.
She just wanted to see Aunt Naggie and Honesty again
and flip through her picture book and go to sleep on her own mattress.

Her eyelids were just starting to lose their battle with gravity
when an alarm began to bleat.
Iñacio was on his feet and in his jacket
before she finished sitting up.
"Somethin's comin'," he said,
frowning at the app in his hand.
"Del that—there's a whole bunch o' somethin's coming."

"More o' those crab bots?"
Iffy asked,
struggling to lace her boots
with fingers that felt like they were made of tofu.

The Ecologist didn't answer.
"Iñacio?"
she asked,
then jumped as he swore explosively.

"It's the Marines.
Couple o' dozen,
headin' straight for us."
He swore again.
"Th' herd's gonna try t' slow 'em down,
but we gotta go."

"Go where?"
Iffy asked,
pulling on her coat.

Iñacio locked eyes with her.
"Anywhere but here.
They ain't never come into th' valley before,
but—Iffy,
this is sacred ground.
You unnerstand?
I gotta choose between this place an' you—"

Iffy held his gaze.
"You do what you gotta do,"
she said,
hoping she sounded braver than she felt.
"We can sort out th' compost 'n' all that some other time."

Two minutes later she was on a bicycle
pedalling hard and breathing harder.
Aunt Naggie had insisted she learn how to ride, "Just in case."
She was pretty sure her foster mother's "in case"
hadn't included this situation,
but there was no time to think about that,
no time to think about whether Iñacio had a plan
because even downhill on the world's best highway
there was no way they could move as fast as the Marines.

Up, down, up again—the forest disappeared behind them
as the track climbed the valley's eastern wall.
There was no sign of pursuit,
just her breathing and the burning in her legs
and a heart-stopping moment of panic
each time the bike hit a pothole or a particularly large rock
and nearly but never actually sent her tumbling
onto gravel that looked a lot sharper from the seak of the bike
than it had when she was walking on it.

Iñacio skidded to a stop as they reached the top of a ridge
and swung around to look back into the valley.
Iffy stopped beside him,
lungs heaving.
"Wha— wha's happenin'?"
she gasped as he pulled his app out of his coat.

He stared at it, stricken.
"They're killin' 'em.
Affin' griefers, they're killin' the herd!"

Iffy craned her neck.
Images tumbled past each other on the app.
A musk ox on its side,
eyes open and lifeless.
Another charging a Marine,
only to have its target step aside at the last moment
and snap a kick that broke the ox's leg.

The app flashed.
The images froze as whatever had been transmitting went offline,
perhaps forever.
"Mother Yanina, Mother Pao, forgive our crimes and arrogance,"
Iñacio whispered.

And then Iffy heard it,
the thrumming roar of a hovercraft moving fast over rough ground.
There!
East of them,
blurred but visible as its camouflage struggled to match the ground beneath it.
"Who th' hell is that?"
Iñacio demanded.

Iffy stared at him.
"How th' hell would I know?
But they brought a friend."
She pointed at a dot in the sky
flying parallel to the hovercraft's course.

Iñacio thrust the app into her hands and unslung his rifle.
"Get back on your bike," he ordered.
"There's a shelter about thirty klicks further on—the app's got a map an' a pass code.
You hole up there an' someone will come find you."

"Are you cracked?" Iffy shot back.
"I can't outrun a bunch o' Marines!
And I *surely* can't outrun that thing."

He adjusted the sight on his rifle.
"You won't have to,"
he said without looking at her.
"Like I told you,
this is sacred ground.
The governors 'n' all haven't stayed away all this time 'cuz we asked nicely."

The app vibrated in Iffy's hand.
"What's it say?"
the Ecologist asked.

Navy blue dots moved across a map in pairs and threes,
each cluster surrounded by a scattering of green dots.
"The Marines are in the valley.
They're almost at the greenhouses."

A red dot appeared on the map,
blinked,
expanded into a circle that swallowed three of the blue dots.
A second later Iffy heard a sharp *crack!* and a roll of thunder.
As the circle faded away,
two of the blue dots blinked and went out.

More red dots bloomed on the map
as one geothermal drill hole after another hit critical pressure and exploded.
"Saints and their mercies," Iffy whispered.

The distant thunder became a steady rumble.
The green dots swarmed the remaining blue dots.
Gunfire rattled and whined in the distance,
but the ballistic shots and EMP pulses that snuffed out the green dots in waves
weren't enough to turn the tide.

Nineteen and five… Sixteen and eight… Fourteen and ten…
The numbers in the corner of the map showed how many blue dots remained
and how many had gone dark.
At twelve and twelve the remaining Marines began to fall back.
The green dots kept pace but let them go.

"How bad is it?" Iñacio asked,
his eyes still on the approaching hovercraft.

Iffy swallowed.
The whole battle had taken less than thirty seconds.
"Half o' them are down.
The others are pullin' out."

"Never mind them," he snapped.
"How bad's the damage?"

She tapped the app to bring up a dozen tiled camera views.
Steam jetted out of the ground in some.
Others showed shattered rock and fallen trees.
And one—
"One o' the greenhouses got hit," she said.
"Looks like a tree came down on it."

Iñacio let out a long breath.
"Praise the saints.
That coulda been a lot worse."

Iffy stared at the video tile that showed a lifeless Marine not much older than her,
his exoskeleton twitching as it tried and failed to get him on his feet.
A crab bot climbed onto his chest and—
She bent over and threw up.
*Please let none o' them be Honesty,* she thought desperately.

"Y'aright?" Iñacio asked as she straightened up.

"No!
No, I'm not affin' aright!"
She spat the last of the sour vomit out of her mouth.
"There's folk *dead* back there!"

He didn't answer.
"Don't that bother you?" she demanded,
anger making her voice shake.

"'Course it does,"
he said brusquely.
"I grieve for every death that comes before its time.
I grieve for them as were made into soldiers against their wishes,
an' for the trees that were a hundred years in growin'
an' coulda lived a thousand more,
an' for every single thing we've torn up or burned down or poisoned or starved,
but right now there ain't time to think about any o' that
because those Marines ain't quit,
they're just comin' round th' long way,
an' we still got this other lot t' worry about."

*«assistance / possibility / negotiate»*

"Wait!"
Iffy grabbed Iñacio's shoulder as he took aim at the approaching drone.
"I think they're maybe on our side."

"Your voices tellin' you that?"
the Ecologist asked skeptically.

"I think so.
It's complicated,"
she added apologetically.

He hesitated before lowering his rifle
and slinging it over his shoulder.
"I hope you're right,"
he said,
taking the app from her and tapping in commands.
"Because we are well an' truly mulched if you're not."
He held it up to show a dozen blue dots converting on the blinking white star
that marked their position.

Moments later they were on their bikes
skidding down the ridge toward the oncoming hovercraft.
The cold air stung Iffy's cheeks,
and if the bumps and potholes on the climb up the ridge had been frightening,
going over them downhill at three times the speed was terrifying.
There wasn't time to be scared, though,
or to think about how quickly the Marines were closing in on them.
There was just staying upright as she followed Iñacio around the next turn
and trying not to go head-first over her handlebars
each time her front tire hit a rock.

Flat ground,
or at least flatter.
She struggled to change gears as Iñacio pulled ahead,
her hands clumsied by her gloves.
The hovercraft was a roaring blur in the distance,
still too far away to help.
She glanced up.
Where was the drone?

And then the bike went one way and she want another
and she was falling
just for a heartbeat
everything happened so fast
her knee hit the ground
pain shot up her spine
she put out her arm
but she was still falling
her hand hit the ground
pain again like a grenade going off in her shoulder.

The bike clattered on the ground,
trapping her leg.
She lay there for a moment in shock,
then cried out as she struggled to get up.
Her knee—her shoulder—it was like someone was using one of Mister Mishra's drills on her.

She kicked free of the bike with her uninjured leg
and cried out as she tried and failed to stand.
Iñacio braked,
fishtailed,
and raced back to her.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry," she repeated
as he leapt off his bike and helped her up.

"Sh, sh, sh."
He helped her sit in the shelter of a lichened outcrop of granite.
"Ya did great.
Ya did great.
Nagatha would be proud o' you.
Now,
keep yer head down.
This is gonna get a bit noisy."
He raised his rifle and took aim.

Iffy felt an explosion through the outcrop.
"Affin' hell," Iñacio swore,
ducking his head.
"That was their drone."

A rock two meters away jumped and splintered.
Iñacio pulled his app out of his coat and swore again.
"They've jammed up all th' sensors,
but there's a satellite comin' up overhead.
We just gotta hang on 'til then."

"Citizens!"
The amplified voice echoed off the rock.
"Surrender yourselves immediately!
We cannot ensure your safety if you do not comply!"

Iñacio caught Iffy's eye and grinned.
"I always thought they sounded pretty stupid when they talked like that."
And then he twisted a button on his cuff
to make the camouflage on his jacket jerk and swirl through not-quite random patterns
designed to confuse the Marines' targeting algorithms,
twisted around and up onto one knee,
and began firing.
He got off two shots before an impact in his chest sent him tumbling backward down the slope.

"Iñacio!" Iffy screamed.
The Ecologist slid downhill another meter and came to a rest,
his legs splayed awkwardly and the rifle still in his hands.

"Citizen!
Remain where you are!
Medical assistance will be provided shortly!"
Boots crunched on gravel uphill,
the steps stretched apart unnaturally by the exoskeletons' long strides.

Iffy got her legs underneath her,
biting back a whimper as pain lanced through her knee again.
She had to help Iñacio.
She had to run,
but there was nowhere to go
and she'd be lucky if she could walk.

*Crack! Crack! Crack!*
Iñacio's rifle jumped a little with each shot.
Iffy heard an indistinct shout of surprise—inducted or not,
the Marines were human enough to swear.
Iñacio rolled sideways back into the lee of the outcrop
as shots peppered the ground where he'd been lying.

"Stay there!" he snapped as Iffy started to rise.
He tossed his rifle aside,
its ammunition spent,
and scuttled uphill and sat beside her,
his back against the outcrop.

"Citizens!"
The Marine sounded more disappointed than angry.
"Such action will only worsen the charges against you.
For your own safety,
we urge you to surrender."

Iñacio looked at Iffy.
"Any ideas?"

She forced a smile that she hoped looked as confident as his grin.
"Reset this sim an' start over?"
As he started to laugh,
a thought appeared in her head.

*«assistance»*

One moment the sky was blue.
The next,
it was slashed by a pair of brilliant laser-straight lines
as the hypersonic harpoons fired by the hovercraft tore the air apart.
The missiles burst over Iffy's head before she had time to flinch.
Dozens of EMP grenades,
each the size of a pebble,
ended their existence in brief bursts of plasma.
Feedback shrieked as the micromotors in a dozen exoskeletons overloaded and fused solid.

Iñacio pulled Iffy to her feet.
"Come on!"

One hand clutching his collar,
the other swinging wildly for balance,
she limp-walked down the gravel slope toward the oncoming hovercraft.
It had turned off its camouflage,
and as it gunned its engines to brake itself
she realized that it was taller than she was
and as long and broad as the *Guinevere*.

"Citizens! Stop!"
The voice behind them was no longer amplified.
"You don't know what you are doing!"

Cold air washed over Iffy as the hovercraft settled onto the ground.
Two sentry bots dropped from its steeply-angled side
and raced past her and Iñacio
to stand guard between them and the fallen Marines.

A hatch opened on the hovercraft's leading edge just as they reached it.
Something bulbous poked out.
Iffy thought it was another bot,
but then he removed his helmet.

"Well,"
said the governor conversationally.
"Isn't this a fine mess?"

"Halley?"
Iñacio demanded incredulously.

Even from ten meters away Iffy felt the temperature drop.
"Paddington South, actually," he corrected
in the same clipped accent that the Marines used.
"Although I suspect that's rather a matter for debate right now,
to tell you the truth.
All I'm sure I've governor of is this craft and a few odds and ends like it."
He patted the hovercraft's hull as if it was an old dog asleep at his feet.

"And you must be Citizen Kwan,"
he continued,
shifting his gaze.
"You've caused quite a ruckus, young citizen.
My others' schemes are completely upside down—thank you for that—and
the machines are in some sort of tizzy
and you seem to be the center of all of it.
I'm sure it will give us plenty to talk about on our way."

Iñacio put a cautioning hand on Iffy's shoulder.
"Appreciate you helpin' out with th' Marines an' all,
but we're fine t' make our own way along by th' coast."

"Mm."
The governor nodded as if agreeing.
"How far do you think you'll get, exactly?
And how much of your precious herd will die along the way?
How many trees will burn, Ecologist,
and how much difference do you think any of it will make?"

"You sure talk pretty,"
Iffy said in the silence that followed.

The governor chuckled.
"Well, I *have* had a lot of practice.
But I'm afraid we can't dawdle any further.
Citizen Corrales,
you and Citizen Kwan can come aboard of your own accord or not as you choose,
but you *are* coming with me."

One—two—three more sentry bots blurred out of invisibility
in front of Iffy and Iñacio.
Mechanical feet scuffed on gravel behind her
as the two she had seen moved closer.

Iñacio puffed out his cheeks and exhaled slowly.
"You know I can't do that," he said.

The governor put his hand on his chest.
"You have my solemn pledge that you will not be interfered with.
I have no desire at all to pick a fight with the Shepherds.
Whatever secrets or access codes you have will remain yours and yours alone."

"Yeah."
Iñacio sighed.
"I wish I believed you,
but your record ain't exactly positive,
an' you just havin' been kicked outta your home,
well,
that's gotta make you a little desperate."

He turned to Iffy and wrapped his arms around her in a fierce hug.
"I'm sorry,"
he whispered in her ear.
"I'm so sorry.
I know I said I'd carry you,
but I can't let 'im have what's in my head.
Tell Nagatha I was thinkin' of her, aright?"

He stepped back and made a fist.
Without warning,
a schematic flashed into Iffy's mind.
Wires and a tiny battery embedded in his hand
that would look prosthetic to a casual scan.
A matching mesh of micro-fine filaments under his skull.
Clench the hand like *this*,
hold it *there*,
and—

As Iñacio raised his hand the governor shouted, "Wait!"
Iffy tackled the Ecologist,
grabbing his arm and knocking him clumsily to the ground.
The EMP that was supposed to scramble his brain
sent feedback shrieking through the sentry bots' motors instead.

Iñacio scrambled back onto his feet.
"No! No, Iffy, whattaya done?"

"Affin' hell!" she swore,
trying, failing, and trying again to stand
despite the spike of pain in her knee.
"You made me a promise an' I'm holdin' you to it.
If you want someone to tell Aunt Naggie that you went an' got simple,
you can do it yourself!"

She glared at him.
The sentry bots and the downed Marines and the hovercraft and the governor
and the miracle in the valley behind them
might as well have been a world away.
"I lost my others.
I lost Honesty.
I ain't losin' you."

## Chapter 10

There were Marines on board Governor Stern's hovercraft,
all apparently imprinted with the same taciturn personality.
Two of them flanked Iñacio
as he disappeared stone-faced into the belly of the hovercraft
while the governor breezily explained to Iffy
that he was a man of his word
and that the Ecologist would be fine.
"Anyway,
it's not as if what he tried to do would actually have worked,"
he said.
Brainwipes worked very differently in real life
than they did in sims.
Deep memories would survive the EMP pulse,
just as a person's original personality survived imprinting.
As for more recent knowledge,
well,
the Shepherds had undoubtedly changed their access codes already,
and their network of shelters and greenhouses weren't actually as secret as they thought.

Iffy expected to be locked in a cell next to Iñacio.
Instead,
a Marine ushered her up steeply-laddered steps to the hovercraft's cockpit.
"Have a seat," the governor said,
gesturing at the padded chair to the left of the one he had been sitting in.
"Oh, and please, do buckle up.
This old thing was built for speed, not comfort."

Iffy limped over to the chair
and lowered herself onto it with a wince.
The governor clucked his tongue.
"I'll have someone take a look at that for you later."
Seating himself and snapping harness straps together across his chest,
he laid his hands on the apps set into the arms of his chair.

The display in front of them came to life.
A dozen views of the surrounding tundra
nestled between status displays like those Iffy had grown up with on the *Guinevere*.
Temperatures and battery reserves,
the rotational speeds of idling engines,
weather reports,
and projections from a hundred independent simulations of the next few moments
waited for attention
like courtiers waiting on a king.

"Where're we goin'?" Iffy asked sullenly.
She had loosened the straps of her harness so that she could wriggle out if she needed to,
but the straps had re-tightened themselves
as soon as she snapped the buckle closed.

"That's an excellent question,"
Governor Stern replied absently
as he rearranged the display with a few flicks of his fingers.
"Where *are* we going?
My others have never had much of an answer.
Truth be told,
I suspect they've never really believed one was needed.
Now, don't mind the noise.
I'm sure you'll get used to it."

The engines beneath them rumbled.
The hovercraft rose like a ship being lifted by a wave,
rotating smoothly on its self-made cushion of air.
Orange status lights blinked and turned green
as the sentry bots climbed back aboard.
"All accounted for, sir,"
said the Marine seated beside Iffy.

"Right, then, tally ho."
The governor flicked his fingers again
and the hovercraft shot forward like a startled seagull.

Acceleration pushed Iffy back in her seat.
Fifty klicks an hour, a hundred… two hundred…
At two hundred and fifty the numbers on the display stopped climbing
and the pressure lifted from her chest.
She took a deep breath and watched the world race by
as the hovercraft bumped and shook toward the horizon.
The only people in the world going faster than her at that preciese moment
were either on trains
or desperate enough to take to the air
and hope the machines' satellites didn't spot them.

The novelty wore off quickly.

Someone did show up
to give Iffy a patch to dull the pain in her knee and shoulder
and speed their healing.
Her eyelids grew heavy
as the drugs and timed retroviral accelerators seeped through her skin.
Even a mug of something thick and sweet that the governor called "chocolate"
wasn't enough to keep them from closing.

At least,
that's what she hoped whoever was watching her would believe.
She had learned how to keep sleep at bay on night watches long ago.
Right now,
she had some thinking to do
and she didn't want to be disturbed.

*Wireframes swam in the darkness.
The hovercraft had been built as a blockade runner in Tashkent
before the start of the machine wars.
Its heart was a reactor originally designed for use in a submarine—she
took a moment to admire the sleek, single-minded recklessness of its design—and
the motors that created its cushion of air
would have pumped fuel at hypersonic speeds
in orbital booster rockets
if history had unfolded just a little bit differently.
The hull plating was angled to deflect the energy of ballistic attacks
and threaded with microfilaments not unlike those in Iñacio's skull
to handle electronic ones.
Ventilation tubes,
triple-redundant optical wiring,
and plumbing liberated from a luxury hotel
slithered between bulkheads.*

*She flipped the wireframe upside down and rightside up,
flew through it,
spun it around.
Any of a dozen rooms or holds could have been repurposed as a cell.
For one moment she thought about reaching out to the hovercraft's core,
but no,
it would be better protected than the railgun back on the pier had been
and anyway,
she still didn't know how she had done that.
She needed a plan if she was going to rescue Iñacio.*

She yawned widely.
The images slipped away as her concentration finally conceded
to the painkillers and reconstructives.
A moment later she began to snore softly.

She woke to the smell of curried noodles,
and for a disoriented few seconds she thought she was back on the *Guinevere*
and late for her watch.
But no,
she was still buckled into her chair in the cockpit of the hovercraft.
She took the plate that the expressionless man in a Marine-blue jumpsuit offered her
and fumbled with the chopsticks
while she waited for her mind to catch up with the rest of her.

The governor was gone,
but the gently undulating tundra on the screens around her looked the same as it had.
Their speed hadn't changed either,
she noticed,
or their heading.
She did a quick calculation in her head.
If they had stayed on their original course,
they must be nearing the coast.
If they followed it east through the Shackletons
it would take them another ten hours to reach Halley,
if in fact that was where they were going.
If they turned right it would take them half again as long to get to
the crater that marked where McMurdo had once been,
and if they headed straight for Paddington South—

She shook her head and scooped some noodles into her mouth,
blowing around them as she realized they were hot *and* spicy.
Going to Halley didn't make any sense,
but since it gave her the least time it was probably what was going to happen.

She chewed thoughtfully,
then looked up at the Marine.
"It's really good,
but can I please have some more onions on it?
An' some more o' that chocolate stuff from earlier?
If that's aright,"
she added hastily.

The Marine looked at her,
his expression still as empty as the tundra.
"Good morning,
Citizen Kwan,"
the governor said pleasantly from a speaker somewhere in the cockpit.
"I'm glad to see you have an appetite."

"It's really good," she said truthfully.
"I'm just used t' more onions."

"Mm.
And of course you'd like to see more of the *Henry Lion*,
I assume."

She shrugged.
"Not much else t' do,
'less you're aright with me talkin' to Iñacio for a bit."

"I'm afraid that's out of the question for now,"
the governor said briskly.
"All right.
Private Norbu will take you down to the galley
and then show you to your cabin.
May I please ask you to forebear any dramatics?"

"What?"
she asked,
fumbling to undo the buckles on her harness.

The governor's voice sighed faintly.
"Don't do anything foolish?"

"Ah.
Sure,
aright."
She wriggled out of the straps without spilling any of her noodles,
then stood up and tested her knee.
Whatever had been in the patch seemed to have set it right.
If she had to run,
she could.
The trick now was having somewhere to run *to*.

As she stepped past Private Norbu
she slipped the metal button cover she had pried off her chair
into her pocket.

The galley was twice the size of the *Guinevere*'s
but much noisier.
The schematic in her head showed her the pipes,
drive shafts,
and optical cables
crammed into the half meter between its floor
and the foamed steel armor on the hovercraft's belly.
She could see three different ways to make trouble if she could reach them,
but she had no way to do that.
Even if she did,
they all had backups that had backups of their own.
The hovercraft was tough by design:
someone could punch a dozen shots from a heavy-duty railgun right through it
without slowing it down.

Private Norbu stood near the galley door and watched her eat.
She ignored him the same way she had learned to ignore shopkeepers
who didn't think an orphan dredger had any place in their store.
She thought briefly about trying to steal her chopsticks,
but by the time she finished her chocolate she had decided it was too risky.
They felt like aluminum,
and she could do a lot with a couple of aluminum rods,
but Private Norbu was right there
and there were probably cameras she couldn't see as well.
No,
the chopsticks were almost certainly a dead end.
The loose screw on the underside of the table,
on the other hand…

Her cabin had a fold-up bunk
and a single shallow drawer set into the bulkhead.
She picked up the app that lay on the neatly-dressed bunk
as Private Norbu closed and locked the door behind her.
It was the same model she had used as a child,
but completely locked down:
she couldn't even get the weather on it,
much less use it connect to Hell.

She kicked off her boots and lay down.
"Lights," she said after a moment.
The room dutifully went dark.

She closed her eyes.
There was no way she had the plans for every piece of hardware on the planet
stuck in her head.
Even if she did,
that wouldn't explain how she was able to talk to the machines
or how they were able to plant ideas in her mind.
She took slow, steady breaths to slow her pulse,
then tried to visualize herself.

Nothing happened at first,
or rather,
hundreds of things that weren't her formed, flew apart, and re-formed behind her eyes.
She saw something that looked like a mechanical musk ox
designed to hide in the herd,
and marvelled for a moment at
the ingenious way it emulated its organic namesake's digestive processes.
This was the *Guinevere* as she had been the day she first sailed.
That was French Henry in pieces on a workbench in Halley,
and for a moment she saw how the bot had once fitted into
an attack craft not unlike the hovercraft she was in.

And that—right there—was her.
She forgot to breathe for a moment as the image rotated slowly,
panning and zooming as her attention shifted.
In her spine,
along her nerves,
laced through her brain:
they weren't wires—those would be too easy for a scanner to spot—but rather
tiny fractalized patches of cells arranged in precisely the right way
to make her a living antenna.

And any antenna that could receive a signal could send one.

It only took her a minute to find an opening in the hovercraft's systems.
It took her another to find one that wasn't a trap,
and another hour to convince herself that she was right.
Fifteen years ago,
just a few days after she had been born,
a tech in Paddington South had replaced a reactor coolant pump
with one salvaged from an Aussie submarine
that had suffered a catastrophic loss of containment.
(Her hand twitched as if swiping an app
to toss aside the insurance reports and obituaries
that thought called up.)
The tech had cut corners to meet a deadline
(another twitch dispelled performance reviews and der eventual dismissal).
One of those corners had been a software shim
to connect the monitor's century-old software
to the hovercraft's merely elderly systems.

She studied the code tangled around the hardware
like nerves and veins around bones.
The pump's core was dumber than a seagull:
if she nudged it there and there and *there*,
it would believe that the hovercraft's reactor was going critical
and bypass its own safeties
to try to prevent disaster.
When the other pumps asked it what the hell it thought it was doing,
the long-ago tech's shoddy work would let her persuade them
that they had been ordered to shut down for maintenance.

She smiled,
not caring who might be watching through a hidden camera,
then rolled on her side and brought her hand to her mouth
as if to stifle a yawn.

The metal button cover she had stolen was stronger than she had expected.
For a moment she thought she might crack a tooth,
but then it bent enough for her to bite down and flatten it.
She spat the half-circle of metal with its two precious points
back into her hand,
rolled over again to cover the motion of slipping it back into her pocket,
and *pushed* with her mind.

Eleven point two meters away,
a pump whirred into overdrive.
Exactly three seconds later
its partners queried it,
compared the answers they received,
and powered down.
Iffy squelched the notifications they sent to the hovercraft's core
moments before they would have set off an alarm.
*Sleep well,* she thought giddily.
She had never ridden a high-speed multi-ton atomic bomb before.
She wondered how many people had,
and how many of them had lived to tell the tale.

She didn't realize her nose was bleeding
until an alarm klaxon began to blare
and she tried to stand up.
She had expected the alarm—in fact,
she was counting on it—but
she hadn't counted on being so lightheaded that
the room went distant and swam around her.
She bent over,
her elbows on the bunk and her face pressed against her forearms.

"Shad," she swore weakly.
There was a lot of blood,
even more than the time Akumé had punched her in the face
for calling der a thief
(which de had been,
but the other kids on the pier had been too smart or too afraid of der to say it).
Wiping her face with a handful of bedsheet didn't stop the steady red drip.

Iffy laughed weakly.
She had been so worried that someone would notice her stealing the button cover,
and now it turned out she needn't have bothered.
She wouldn't have to scratch herself to get a few red cells
to fool the hovercraft's genetic sensors:
she had as many as she could possibly want.

She straightened up and worked her tongue in her mouth.
It still felt like someone had replaced it with a piece of pressed jellyfish,
but the room no longer felt like an endlessly-receding tunnel from a horror sim.
She focused on the app lying on the bunk and pushed with her mind once again.
Something inside the door clicked and it slid aside.

Two minutes later she stood in front of another cabin door
and pressed her sticky hand against the contact place beside it.

"Affin' heck, girl, what happened t' you?" Iñacio asked as he stood.

"You should see the other guy," she said
grinning woozily.
"Any idea where our gear is?"

He shook his head.
"Prolly in a recycler by now anyway.
So whatta we do now?"

She jerked her chin toward the stern.
"Back an' out an' then figure th' rest out from there."

Someone was banging against one of the doors they passed.
They were shouting, too.
Iffy thought it was funny but didn't have enough energy to laugh.
At some point Iñacio had put his arm around her to help her stay upright.
He had picked up a fire extinguisher as well,
a compact red cylinder with a silver handle
whose basic design hadn't changed in centuries.
She blinked away the specs that flashed into her mind.
*Not now,* she thought.
Her nose was still dripping.
Anyone who wanted to find them could just follow the trail of drops and streaks on the floor.

"Here," she mumbled.
"…straps…"

"'Saright, 'saright, I got it,"
Iñacio said soothingly.
He turned her around and lowered her onto the molded plastic seat,
then buckled the harness across her chest
and pulled a bulky pair of goggles down over her eyes and nose.
"Bite on this,"
he told her,
pushing a mouthpiece against her lips.

Cold air filled her lungs as she breathed in.
"Ready?
No,
don' worry,
I'll be right behind you."
He took her wrists and placed her hands on the grips built into the seat.
"One… two… *three*."

She screamed into the mouthpiece as hovercraft fired the ejection seat into the air
like an old-fashioned artillery shell.
Daylight blinded her.
Ice-cold wind instantly numbed her cheeks.
Tiny gyros whined to stabilize the chair
long enough for the explosive bolts in its back to fire.
A translucent parawing snapped open.
The surge of deceleration threw her against her harness
and then she was swinging like a pendulum
as the parawing's tiny core picked a safe landing spot
and turned toward it.

The ground below her was covered with snow.
The harsh white reached from horizon to horizon,
interrupted only by a few dark boulders
and the camouflaged rectangular bulk of the hovercraft
that was already several hundred meters away.
It must have turned inland toward the pole,
but Iffy didn't have time to think about that.
She was flying,
really actually flying,
except it was going to be over in a few seconds
and if the chair hit the ground the wrong way
she might tumble and snap her neck.
The gyros were supposed to prevent that,
but she had seen their specs when she was planning her escape
and they had last been serviced by the same tech
who had screwed up the coolant pump.

A flash of light at the rear of the hovercraft
threw a black dot into the seamless blue sky.
A hundred meters above the ground it jerked suddenly
as its parawing deployed.
Iffy's fumbling fingers finally found the catch on the harness buckle.
It bleeped and flashed,
unhappy about being unfastened while in the air,
but she jammed her thumb down hard to force it open.

Snow raced away beneath her far too fast for safety.
She was headed straight for a boulder.
She was going to hit it.
She was going to hit it,
but the parawing cupped the air to brake,
throwing her hard against the straps as if to punish her for breaking its rules.

The chair landed on the snow with a crunch.
Iffy spat out the mouthpiece,
pulled off her goggles,
wriggled out of the straps,
tripped,
and fell face-first into the little snowbank thrown up by the chair's impact.
Ice crystals stung her face and hands.
It was cold,
she realized,
really cold.
They must have come a long way inland.

The chair bleeped.
Panels popped off its bulky arms
to reveal a featherweight windproof parka rolled up
to be not much larger than a lunch-sized roti on one side
and a waistpack with a tiny first aid kid,
a ruggedized app,
a pair of multitools,
and three high-energy snack bars on the other.
The specs had shown four,
and as she strapped the waistpack on
she wondered if that long-ago tech had gotten hungry while he was working.

It took her three tries to clamber up the boulder.
Her nosebleed had stopped,
leaving bits of red crust on her lip,
but she was still lightheaded.
She shielded her eyes with her hand.
There—Iñacio's chair had just landed a few hundred meters away.
The governor had undoubtedly retaken control of the hovercraft,
only to discover that all three coolant pumps had burned out
and would need to be replaced
before it could move again.
If his Marines had the same exoskeletons as the ones in Halley and Rothera,
she and Iñacio only had a few minutes before they arrived
to recapture their ex-prisoners.

"Hey!"
She waved both arms.
Iñacio waved back and started toward her.
Iffy slipped off the boulder,
made her way back to the chair,
and got to work.

The upper back plate on the ejection seat had six screws.
The lower plate only had four.
The schematic in her head didn't need them,
but she pocketed them anyway as she took them out.
"No such thing as scrap," she muttered under her breath.
It was one of Mister Mishra's favorite sayings,
but there wasn't time to think about him or Jeep
because she had to tighten the spigot valve on the seat's tiny fuel line all the way
before prying out the fist-sized tank of high-test peroxide
or she and her escape were both going to be very short-lived.

Iñacio's boots crunched on the snow a minute later.
"What're you—oh no.
No no no,
you can't be serious."

She grinned madly and pointed at the parawing
without looking up from the vernier motor she was crimping into place.
"Straighten that out if you can
an' then get the straps off th' chair.
We're gonna have t' double up."

Another minute, another minute—there.
Iñacio handed her the ends of the parawing's tether lines.
She clipped them onto the harness and handed it back to him.
"I can't carry you, so you gotta carry me," she said,
cutting off his protests.

The snow field dipped gently on the far side of the boulder.
It wasn't much,
but it would have to do.
"Ready?" she asked.

Iñacio shook his head.
"Nope."
He bent over like a sprinter and started to run.

Iffy waited for the lines to go nearly taut before shouting,
"Now!"
and yanking the edge of the parawing up as hard as she could.
The makeshift rocket strapped to Iñacio's back flared,
kicking him forward.
For an instant Iffy thought it wasn't going to work,
but the core she had pulled out of the chair wasn't smart enough to wonder
how or why its world had changed.
It just knew its wing was out of position.
Tiny motors whirred,
frantically adjusting the parawing's shape
so that it cut the air at just the right angle
to lift Iñacio into the air.

He whooped,
his feet still pedalling as they left the ground.
Iffy ran back and scrambled up the boulder and shielded her eyes,
her heart pounding.
Four black dots had come over the horizon.
She counted seconds under her breath.
The snow was slowing them down, but not much.

"Over here!" she shouted,
waving as Iñacio banked in a wide, clumsy turn.
One moment he was over *there*
and the next he was coming straight at her,
wide-eyed and shouting something she couldn't hear.
She took a deep breath and spread her arms wide.

Iñacio hit her with a thump that cracked her spine.
His hands scrabbled for purchase on her parka,
but the fabric was too slippery,
it was designed to shed water and he couldn't get a grip
but that was aright,
she had grabbed hold of the straps
and her feet were kicking at nothing but air.

She twisted around as far as she dared as he whooped again.
The rocket on his back flared again,
lifting them higher.
*It's me, it's just me,* she thought frantically,
hoping that whatever faraway machine she had made her bargain with was listening.

"So what now?"
Iñacio had to shout to be heard over the wind in their ears.

"I gave it a heading,"
Iffy shouted back.
"Figure we got about half an hour in the air.
We'll have to walk the rest o' the way."
The snow field below her looked exactly like a sim but was completely different.
She finally understood why so many people wrote poetry about flying,
and why they said that of all the machines had taken away from humanity,
this was the one whose loss hurt the most.

In the end the little rocket only lasted ten minutes,
but that was enough to get them high enough to catch the wind.
Antarctica rolled away behind them.
Iffy's shoulders began to ache,
then to burn.
The straps they were tangled in dug in to her triceps.
She'd have bruises,
but she'd had worse,
and the view—whatever else happened,
she swore she would find a way to fly again.

After one last lift from a thermal rising off a stretch of exposed rock
they began a long, slow descent.
"Get ready!" Iñacio shouted.
Iffy grabbed the strap with one numb hand and let go with the other
so that she was half beside and half behind him.
The parawing's little motors whined in protest as they reshaped it
to adjust for the shift in weight.
Ten seconds…
Five…
As her boots grazed the snow she tried to run,
but her toe caught on a crust of ice.
She let go of Iñacio and sprawled face-forward.

His landing was more graceful.

"Well," he said,
helping her to her feet
as the parawing carried the harness away.
"Can't wait to tell Nagatha about *that*."

She wiped ice and snow off her face and returned his grin.
"Sure was somethin'.
C'mon,
we still got some walkin' t' do."

Two snack bars and several mouthfuls of lukewarm water later,
they reached an outcropping of rock too regular to be natural.
Iñacio ran his hands over the pipe shafts drilled into its laser-cut top.
"Old weather station?" he hazarded.
"Looks like it was salvaged a long time gone."

"Mm hm."
Iffy pointed at the shadow on the horizon.
"You know what that is?"

Iñacio laughed.
"Girl,
I have no idea where I am right now.
You could tell me that was the Andes an' I'd believe you."

"That's Mount Tyree."
Iffy's voice was more serious than she'd intended.
"The secret base Wales an' th' machines an' everyone have been goin' on about?
It's halfway 'round to your right an' just shy o' the peak.
I figure that's where th' governor was takin' us."

Iñacio nodded slowly.
"Long way off."

"Yeah, well."
Iffy studied the dark rock in front of them.
"Dunno what kind o' sims you play,
but my favorites?
Nobody puts an underground base in 'em without puttin' a bunch of other stuff around it,
so I had a poke around the governor's backups while you were lazin' around on th' hovercraft."

There.
She pulled off her glove,
scraped some dried blood out of her nostril,
and stuck her finger in one of the drill holes.
The rock thought for a second and then opened with a faint click.

She grinned at Iñacio.
"Welcome to *my* secret lair."

*Suppose the world is ending
and you want to build a secret research facility—a place
completely cut off from what's left of the world's governments
or (more importantly) their artificial minions
so that you can create or study things you shouldn't
without being interrupted.
You might think that the first step was to choose a location,
but it's not.
The actual first step is to pick a cover story
that gives you a plausible reason to imprint prisoners and indentured laborers
with the skills you need
and then erase their memories afterward.
(In theory you will only erase their memories of where they were and what they did.
In practice the process is sometimes imprecise,
particularly if you want to err on the side of caution,
but if you're the sort of person who needs a secret research facility,
you're probably also the sort who believes that
nothing worth having comes without some kind of price.)*

*If your cover story is something to do with reforesting ravaged rainforests
you will probably build your base in Africa or Indonesia.
You might consider Brazil,
but even before the war with the machines
it has become a complicated place as nationalism,
macumba,
and apocalyptic ecology hybridize in ever-more-strident ways.
If your cover story is related to climate engineering,
on the other hand,
no one will raise an eyebrow if your site is somewhere formerly arctic.
The Melt hit the poles first and hardest,
and most of those mad enough to believe that the damage can be undone
by scattering megatons of absorbent catalysts over thousands of square kilometers
naturally congregate there.*

*The poles are exactly the wrong place to go
if you want people to believe that you plan to launch something into orbit,
but in a way that works in your favor.
Everyone expects you to lie about what you're actually doing,
so telling part of the truth is a good way to hide the part left unsaid.
A ground station for a network of microsatellites
flung into orbit by an automated factory located somewhere on the far side of the Moon?
You are so obviously courting condemnation for adding to the already catastrophic volume of space junk
that no one will suspect that's what your base is actually for.
Or rather,
everyone (and everything) will suspect it,
but only as one of a thousand low-probability possibitilies.*

*To finish throwing them off the scent,
you can build a dozen safe havens in a circle around your base.
To keep the workers safe,
your public relations bot explains to anyone who cares to pay attention.
Antarctica's storms have been growing in frequency and severity for decades,
and it will only be a matter of time before tornadoes appear.
You may not be able to guarantee that your laborers will return with their memories intact,
but you will of course do your utmost to ensure that they do return.
Deeply dug and well provisioned,
your bunkers will allow them to wait out the worst the southern continent can throw at them in comfort.*

Iñacio insisted on climbing down the ladder ahead of Iffy,
so he was the first one to realize that something bad had happened in the shelter
many years ago.
"You might not wanna come down here,"
he called up to her.

*Ain't like a got a lot o' choices,*
she thought but didn't say.
The Marines could reach them in a couple of hours if they pushed their exoskeletons to their limits,
but the governor was sure to have other tools at his disposal.
If they couldn't find something in the shelter they could be trapped,
and a siege would only end one way.

The smell hit her halfway down.
It wasn't rank like the week-dead seagull she had once found in a storage bin behind the Sandhus' store,
trapped by a lid closing behind it as it scrounged for scraps.
Instead,
the smell was tired and a little bit sour.

"Core woulda shut off power after he died,"
Iñacio said as they studied the mummified body
lying a stride away from the bottom of the ladder.
"Cold an' dry air—coulda happened last year,
coulda been a hundred years ago."

"More likely a hundred,"
Iffy replied,
feeling oddly detached.
Whoever he had been,
he'd had long dark hair and a beard.
The inside of his parka was silvered like hers,
and if he had brought any gear,
it had either been taken by whoever shot him
or was lying on the shelves that lined the shelter's walls.

She shook herself.
"C'mon.
Let's see what we got."

What they had turned out to be weapons,
dried food that had either spoiled or mummified like the corpse,
several camouflage snowsuits with boots and breathing masks
(she puzzled over this for a bit),
and a small workshop stocked with tools and spare parts that made her hands itch.
"Looks like they were buildin' bots,"
she told Iñacio,
turning a laser cutter over in her hands.

"Or takin' 'em apart."
He pulled a tarp off something that looked like
an oversized version of the sentry bots she was familiar with.
One of its side panels was folded back to reveal its motors and cables.
Another tarp revealed a second bot with the same bulky body and limbs
but a cluster of cameras and antennas where its head should have been.
The mod had clearly been made in haste:
the welds joining the additions to the bot's neck looked messy and unfinished,
and a handful of string-thin optical cables dangled from the opening.

Iffy looked around the shelter's single large room a second time.
Something didn't make sense.
"How were th' bots gonna get out?" she asked suddenly.
"No way they could make it up th' ladder."

Iñacio nodded,
putting the short-barrelled thump gun he had picked up
back on its shelf.
"I'll check th' walls.
You wanna see if you can get anythin' outta that?"
He pointed at the desktop near the two bots.

She nodded and sat on the stool in front of it.
The faint scum of dust on the app felt gritty under
the finger she swiped across it.
"Aright,"
she muttered.
"What have you got for me?"

Five minutes later she smacked the app in frustration.
"I can't find a way in," she sulked,
slumping down in the chair.

"Here."
Iñacio tossed her a thumb-sized key on a thin chain.
"It was around his neck,"
he explained as she stooped over to pick it up.

The key fit into a slot on the edge of the app.
Its screen went a deep blue.
A single icon appeared,
waiting patiently to be tapped.

Iffy bit her lip.
"Could be some kind o' malware.
Like, a trap or somethin' to fry anyone that looks at it."

Iñacio nodded.
"Could be."
Without warning he spun her around
and pushed hard on the back of her chair.

"Hey!" she squawked as she rolled away.
"What are you—"

"—a chance to hear this,
but if you do,
I'm sorry, love.
I'm so, so sorry."
The recorded voice was a man,
and sounded tired and frightened and brave all at once.
"I thought we could fix things,
but we've only made them worse."

Iñacio turned and beckoned her to join him as the recording continued.
"Suyin left this morning with the last of the shielding."
The voice chuckled or choked back a sob—it was impossible to tell which.
"She said she thought she might be able to make it to the machine
if she cycled the algorithm rapidly enough,
but I think she just wanted to be with Georgia,
wherever the hell she is now.
None of the other shelters are answering any more,
not even Johnson's team."

Iffy reached for Iñacio's hand.
He squeezed hers back.
"I've disabled two of the guard robots—at least I think I have—but
number three is still roaming around in the auxiliary tunnels.
I know we all agreed that—that the project needed a failsafe,
but…"
The voice paused for a heartbreaking moment.
"But I never thought we'd need it.
I never thought we'd—oh crap."

Iffy jumped at the sharp *crack!*
Iñacio squeezed her hand again at the sound of something heavy hitting the floor.
A moment later metal clicked on concrete
as something approached the app,
and then the recording ended with a soft, cheerful *ding*.

"Well."
Iñacio gently pulled his hand free and swiped the app.
"Doctor Arno Severin,"
he read aloud as Iffy lowered herself back into her chair.
"Doesn't say who it was for,
but I'm guessin' these two were Suyin an' Georgia."
He paused.
"Oh.
Well,
ain't this a surprise."
He looked at her over his shoulder.
"I think you're gonna wanna see this."

Iffy nodded but didn't stand.
She knew the Marines were getting closer every moment,
but all of a sudden she just felt tired.

"Iffy?
Y'aright?"

"Yeah."
She pulled herself to her feet.

Two dozen smiling, confident faces were arranged on the app
in eight rows of three.
The top row contained a man with long dark hair and a beard
and two women who looked like clones of each other.

"Recognize him?" Iñacio asked,
pointing.

Iffy nodded slowly.
"Yeah.
Yeah, I do."
Somehow she wasn't surprised to see Johnson Wales looking back at her.

## Chapter 11

There were no other recordings,
at least not that Iffy could find,
but there were maps and schematics.
The maps showed a network of maintenance tunnels
just big enough for centipede-shaped bots
that reminded Iffy of French Henry.
She would be able to fit her arm into one of them,
but no more,
and some of them ran (or had run) for tens of kilometers.

There were other tunnels too, though,
big enough for heavy equipment.
Some were dense with red flags that showed collapse,
flooding,
or chronic instability.
She puzzled over that for a second before dismissing it.
Reasons weren't important:
a blocked tunnel was no use to them.

Iffy had expected the web of tunnels to be centered on the Niobium base.
Instead,
the center was a kilometer further south
on the slope of Mount Tyree instead of at its peak.
Iñacio shrugged when she pointed this out.
"Wouldn't be surprised if th' real whatever is somewhere else again."
He jerked his head toward Severin's remains,
which he had wrapped in the tarp he had pulled off the sentry bot.
"Folks like this never thought in straight lines.
Whatever you can see ain't real,
and whatever's real,
they'll have hidden under three different kinds o' camouflage."

But the mystery of what was actually buried under Mount Tyree
wasn't what made Iffy chew her lips
the way she had when she was first learning algebra.
That was the schematics' fault.
They made no sense.
She could think of a hundred uses for a superconducting ring
large enough to sail the *Guinevere* through,
but why put a bamboo rat cage at its center?
And if you had a yottahertz laser capable of vaporizing steel from orbit,
why would you point it directly at an identical laser,
and why would you leave just enough space between them for
one (1) adult with arctic-rated camping equipment
and a month's worth of high-energy rations?

She sat back,
stretched,
and yawned so widely that her jaw clicked.
The only explanation that made sense was that
the app's records had been deliberately scrambled and polluted
when things went skew.
It didn't matter now:
if the governor had sent Marines,
they would arrive in an hour,
maybe less.
She had done her best to wipe the shelter from the hovercraft's memory,
but they would have other records.
Even if they didn't,
they would have to be blind to miss the parawing and bootprints,
and they wouldn't have come all this way
without something that could cut through
the rock concealing the entrance.

"I don't like it,"
Iñacio said,
studying the route she had sketched on the map
that filled half the app.

Iffy shrugged.
"Every other way I can find has a big chunk o' walkin' in it.
This might too if there's been more cave-ins,
but there's no way o' knowin' 'til we get there.
'Sides,
more chance o' meetin' some actual monsters this way.
Be a waste t' be down here an' not run into any."

The Ecologist snorted.
"Folks ever tell you you're a bit sideways from normal?"

Iffy shrugged again.
"Most never get t' know me well enough to find out,"
she admitted.

Iñacio put his hand on her shoulder and gave her a gentle shake.
"I'm glad I have.
You get th' bots back online.
I'll see what I can do about wheels."
He studied the sketch she had thrown together
on the other half of the app,
shook his head,
and began rummaging through the shelves of equipment that lined the shelter's wall.

It took Iffy ten minutes to fix the damage done to the sentry bots
and another ten to convince herself they were safe to power on.
Their optical sensors didn't glow red—that only happened in sims—but
she did take an involuntary step back
when their heads turned in unison toward her.

"Sit," she ordered.
One lowered itself to the concrete.
The other studied her
while its core tried to decide whether her voice patterns
matched those in its memory closely enough.

"I said *sit*," she repeated as firmly as she could.
The bot took a step toward her,
hesitated,
and crouched beside its twin.

Iffy swallowed drily.
The problem wasn't that the bots' programming was too complex for her to figure out.
The problem was that it was too simple to fool easily.
She didn't know if that was because they were old enough
that their code didn't have anything from the machine wars mixed into it,
or whether they had been built that way deliberately for safety.
Mister Mishra was fond of saying that there was no way to fool a hammer.
Just this once she hoped he was wrong.

"You just about done?"
She jumped at Iñacio's voice.

"Hope so," she said briskly,
promising herself mentally that she would never watch another horror sim again.
"Let's hook 'em up."

Long before there were buses and hovercraft there were ox-carts and chariots.
Iffy didn't know if anyone had ever built one to be pulled by two sentry robots,
but if so,
she was pretty sure they hadn't made it out of
a heavy-duty dolly and fiber optic cables.
She nudged it skeptically with her boot.
The frictionless bearings in its wheels were undamaged,
so it would roll enough,
but even without the schematics in her head
she could see that it would want to slip, tip, or flip
at every bump and corner.

Iñacio took a moment to say a few quiet words over what was left of Arno Severin,
then lowered himself gingerly onto the dolly beside her.
A plastic crate full of tools sat beside her,
and another one with weapons and spare parts for the bots nestled under his elbow.
None of the weapons had responded to their touch,
but they would still add useful weight.

The Ecologist looked at her and grinned.
She grinned back.
"Yip yip!" she said,
snapping the cables she had rigged as reins.
("So that I'll have somethin' t' hold onto,"
she had told Iñacio,
who had nodded straight-faced in response.)

The bots didn't move.
Iffy sighed.
"Forward one quarter speed," she ordered.
The dolly jerked beneath her as the bots set off at a trot into the tunnel.
Iñacio thumbed a handlight and pointed it ahead of them.

"Increase speed to one half."
The dolly's wheels made a sizzling sound as they rolled faster into the unknown.

Iffy had expected the tunnel to be level,
but instead it rose and fell with a kilometer-long rhythm.
"For drainage?" Iñacio hazarded,
though the floor was desert dry.

After half an hour her back was aching and her backside had gone numb.
She was about to suggest that they stop to stretch
when the two sentry bots pulled up short.
"Whoa!" she squawked as the dolly smacked hard into their hind legs.

The bots ignored her.
Their heads twitched this way and that in an almost birdlike way.
The one that had hesitated before accepting her orders took a step and stopped.
Without warning a panel on its back flipped open
and something stubby and lethal looking popped up.

Iñacio swore under his breath and reached for the crate beside him.
The gun on the bot's back spun around to point at him.
"Aright, aright," the Ecologist said,
raising both hands.

He caught Iffy's eye and jerked his head backward.
She nodded,
then swivelled slowly to the side and put her boots on the concrete.
When Neither of the bots moved
she slid forward and slowly stood up.

Metal clicked on concrete somewhere in the darkness ahead of them.
The bot's gun spun around again.
"Easy, easy," Iñacio said soothingly as he got to his feet as well.
"I'll just get all this off you an'—nope, nope, ne'er mind."
He let go of the cables he had gathered up in one hand and stepped back.
The bot's gun tracked his motion for one extra warning second
before spinning around to point into the darkness once again.

"I think—" Iffy started,
biting off her words when Iñacio flashed the flat-palmed handsign that meant "quiet".
*I think it's the other bot,*
she finished in her head.
She closed her eyes and tried to slow her breathing.
Nothing:
no images flashed into her mind
and no thoughts suddenly emerged fully-formed.

Metal clicked on concrete again.
Her eyes snapped open.
The sound was *behind* them this time.

She and Iñacio turned in unison.
The light in the Ecologist's hand reflected off three—no, four—bots
like the pair that had been pulling the dolly.
One was missing part of a foreleg.
Another's side was deeply dented
as if something had tried to punch right through it,
and all four bore more scratches and scars than Iffy could count.

The lead bot took a step toward them.
"Hey now," Iñacio cautioned.
"We ain't lookin' for trouble."

"Ssh."
Iffy studied the bot.
"I don't think it wants t' hurt us.
Matter o' fact…"
She raised both her hands,
turned around slowly,
and reached into the crate of tools she had packed earlier.

"F'real?" Iñacio muttered disbelievingly.

"You got a better idea?" she shot back under her breath.
An adjustable wrench,
a screw jack that might be able to outdent the bot's side—what she really needed
was Mister Mishra's shop and Johnson Wales' toolbox,
but these would have to do.

She turned around to face the bots and held the tools out.
"Aright?" she asked.

None of the bots moved.
For one panicked moment Iffy thought she had guessed wrong,
but then the bot that had stepped forward took two more steps toward her
and lowered itself into a crouch.

"We don't have time for this,"
Iñacio said quietly a moment later.

"Tell them that,"
Iffy replied absently.
These bots had been built to be scouts and guards and weapons.
The blunt claws on the ends of their legs could pick up a rock
or grab hold of someone's arm,
but were no good for delicate work.
Scratches and dents on the bot's inner frame showed
where they had tried to repair each other anyway.

"Gimme the crate,"
she said over her shoulder.
"Please."
Iñacio lifted it off the dolly and set it down beside her without comment.

Wire,
a crimping tool that she could use to cut it,
a screwdriver with a torsion readout built into its handle—there.
She patted the bot's back.
"Good as new."
Which was a lie,
but felt like the right thing to say.

The bot stood,
braced its legs,
and shivered through a rapid self-test.
When the reflex capacitor that Iffy had just wired into place didn't rattle
it made a soft, incongruous *ping*
and stepped aside to make room for another member of its pack.

Iffy put her tools back in the crate and stood.
"I'm sorry,"
she said.
"We gotta keep movin',
but if you wanna come with us
I'll fix you when we get somewhere safe."

The bots didn't move.
"We really gotta go,"
Iff said,
turning to pick up her crate.

A clawed foreleg closed around her arm.
"Hey!"
She smacked it with her hand.
"None o' that, aright?"

The bot released her but didn't back up.
She glanced at the two still in harness and frowned.
"Pass me a cable,"
she said to Iñacio.
"I have an idea."

The bots didn't have collars,
but a lifetime at sea had taught Iffy dozens of ways to tie a knot.
She left plenty of slack so that the bots could pull their heads out if they needed to.

When she was done,
the three bots that had all of their legs waited patiently in a line behind the dolly,
the cable loops around their necks.
Iñacio shook his head.
"Nagatha's never gonna believe this."

Iffy grinned.
"Come on, you," she said to the fourth bot.
"Up you get."
She put her hand where its neck would have been and tugged it forward.
Limping,
it clambered up onto the dolly and crouched down
where Iffy and Iñacio had been sitting.

"Nope, nope, not there."
She tugged it again,
then sighed when it didn't move.
"Aright,
stay there if you want to—we'll get a better view up front anyway."

"Can we go now?"
Iñacio asked testily.

Iffy nodded.
"Yip yip!"
The bots in front of them didn't move.
"Worth a try," she muttered.

"Forward one quarter speed,"
Iñacio ordered.
A moment later they were rolling through the tunnel once again
with three of the new bots following single file behind them.

Iffy leaned back gingerly.
The crippled bot on the dolly rotated its head to study her.
After a moment she draped an arm over its back to steady herself.
It wasn't actually more comfortable than just sitting upright,
but it was somehow more comforting.

She didn't notice the extra clattering at first.
Or rather,
she wasn't the first to notice that
there was more sound behind them than there should be.

She snapped out of her daze when the three sentry bots
trotting in step in the dolly's wake pulled up short.
"Shad!"
The dolly smacked hard into the hind legs of the ones in front,
who had stopped two mechanical strides later.
Six boxy clusters of sensors and cameras swivelled
to point back the way they had come.

That's when Iffy heard it:
the rhythmic *clunk clunk clunk* of exoskeletoned feet on concrete.
Iñacio was already on his feet
with something that looked like a high-pressure paint sprayer in his hands.
"Only thing that doesn't have a lock-out,"
he said.

Iffy was already unlooping the cables around the bots' necks.
"Listen,"
she said,
squatting in front of the one she had repaired
so that her head and its sensors were on the same level.
"I know we're not who you were s'posed t' be guardin',
but those folk back there?
They're *really* not s'posed t' be here."
She fished the screwdriver out of her pocket and held it up.
"You fix that an' I promise,
I'll do my best t' fix you all."

She had no reason to believe the bot could understand her.
Its core had probably been imprinted with a dog's mind
like Doctor Johel's armored G-80 back in Rothera.
There was no telling what strange loops it might have formed
in the century it had spent patrolling these abandoned tunnels.
For all she knew it would take one look at the Marines
and decide they were its true masters.

The bot took a step forward and to butted her gently with its head,
then turned and disappeared into the darkness
with its two companions at its heels.

The fourth bot rose onto its three good legs.
It didn't make a sound,
but Iffy imagined that if it could have whined it would have.
"They'll be aright,"
she told it as she took her seat on the dolly,
wishing she believed her own words.

The first explosion echoed through the tunnel a few minutes later.
"Increase speed to full,"
Iñacio snapped at the harnessed bots.
Gunfire chattered behind them—Iffy couldn't tell how far away—and then
the sound-shock of another explosion rolled past them.

"Get down!" she ordered
The three-legged bot had risen to its feet again,
its body swaying slightly as its algorithms steadied its misbalanced weight
atop the dolly.

"I said get—affin' heck, look out!"
Iffy ducked
as the three-legged bot jumped over her.
The dolly slewed wildly,
skidded,
and straightened out.

The tunnel was climbing now,
a long steady incline that Iffy hoped would lead to
the surface or the secret Niobium base
or whatever it had been built to distract from.
The first painted stripe on the wall flew past so quickly that
she wasn't sure she had seen it.
A second, then a third with a six-digit number stenciled next to it,
and then the tunnel leveled out and automatic lights came on over their heads,
turning everything the dark red she associated with night watches.

The bots slowed and stopped
as the dolly rolled into a dimly-lit space several times larger
than the bunker they had left.
A blast door slid closed behind them,
metal scraping on stone for the first time in a century.
They had arrived.

"Lights on?" Iñacio said after a moment.
"*Acendé luz?*
*Lampo roshan kon?*"

The three-legged bot made a high-pitched whining sound.
Iffy squinted as clinically-white strips in the walls and ceiling obediently lit up,
then sucked in her breath.
She had hoped they would find a workshop
and feared it would be a graveyard,
but this—she hadn't expected this.

Six thick cylinders lay on their sides in two rows of three,
each one surrounded by pipes and machinery.
A bulky mass made of meter-square bricks loomed in the background.
The three-armed logo painted on its side was redundant:
even before schematics took shape in her head
she recognized the reactor for what it was.

One of the cylinders had been opened.
She and Iñacio exchanged looks.
He nodded as if to answer a question she hadn't asked,
then hefted the thing that looked like a paint sprayer
and edged forward cautiously.

She held her breath as he neared the cylinder,
only letting it out when he glanced inside and lowered the sprayer.
"'S empty," he said,
sounding as relieved as she felt.
"An' look—one o' th' suits is missin' too."
He gestured at the wall to their left
where five silvered body suits hung from swing-out racks
in front of matching boots and helmets.

"Stay here,"
Iffy told the bots.
Singh, Velikov, DiOrio, Yuen, Boghosian—and Johnson.
The label above the missing suit read "Johnson",
but what did "High Medina" mean,
and where had she seen that logo before?
A red circle with a green crescent set into it,
a four-pointed white star…

"They were Martians!" she blurted.
"It was in one o' my history sims.
Some trillionaire gave up on fixin' th' world
an' wanted t' run away t' Mars.
They got a few rockets up b'fore space got affed up
an' then—"
She shrugged,
slightly embarrassed by how excited she had momentarily sounded.
Honesty had teased her once about being a space geek
and she had never mentioned it to der again.
"Th' machine wars started an' nobody ever heard anythin' more from them."

Iñacio nodded, stony-faced.
"I know th' story.
Coulda saved a million trees or a million lives
with what they spent tryin' t' get away from what they'd done."
He hefted the sprayer again,
and for a moment she thought he might use it on the empty cylinder.
"You ever meet any o' my folk an' they call you an astronaut,
it ain't a compliment."

"But what're they doin' here?"
Iffy walked past the motionless bots harnessed to the dolly
and ran a finger along one of the unopened cylinders.
"An' who's been cleanin' this all these years?"

The crippled bot on the dolly surged to its feet.
The panel on its back flipped open.
A stubby needle gun popped up.
Its targeting laser drew a thin red line through the air
to a squat four-wheeled service bot
that had just rolled into view from somewhere further back in the chamber.

The service bot froze and made a warbling sound.
The three-legged bot tilted its head toward Iffy.
"Um, sure," she said helplessly.
The laser blinked off,
but the sentry bot stayed on its feet
as the service bot began to wipe down the nearest cylinder
with a brush whose bristles had long since worn away.

Iñacio swiped an app set into a work table next to one of the cylinders
and studied the displays that appeared.
"Reconciliation Team Beta,"
he read aloud.
"Alpha's in a shelter east o' here
an' Gamma 'n' Delta are 'round th' other way."
He frowned.
"This doesn't make any sense.
They all have cryogenization an' the same date,
but then decryogenization on different dates."

"So they all got unfrozen at different times,"
Iffy said,
shrugging.

Iñacio shook his head.
"That's what's weird about it.
Accordin' to this,
they all got unfrozen *before* they were frozen, not after."
He cleared his throat.
"And,
um,
those five?
They all got a flag beside their names that says 'nonviable'.
Only one marked green is Johnson."

Iffy hunched her shoulders inside her parka and shivered.
She was hungry and needed a bathroom
and she was tired of being in places where people were dead.
"That thing show you a way outta here?"

The Ecologist shrugged.
"Th' tunnel that way gets us to Alpha,
or we can go th' other way to Gamma.
There's another one into th' Niobium thing,
an' from there we can get to whatever's in th' middle of all this.
'Scuse me."
He stepped aside to let the service bot roll past him on its rounds.

He looked as tired as she felt,
Iffy realized,
and felt a pang for not having thought about it before.
"Maybe there's bunks in back or somethin'?" she hazarded.

"Nah."
Iñacio shook his head.
"This place wasn't for workin' or livin'.
This was a warehouse.
An' anyway,
we gotta keep movin'.
Those bots mighta slowed th' Marines down,
but they won't'a stopped 'em."

Iffy *really* wanted a bathroom,
but she had once stood an eight-hour watch on the *Guinevere*
when Aunt Naggie was sick
without a single break
despite six cups of tea.
"Th' hell with whatever they were doin' down here,"
she said.
"Let's get to th' base and figure out a way outta this mess."

The service bot pivoted on its wheels to face her.
"The way out is simple, Citizen Kwan,"
a familiar voice said.
"All you have to do is stay where you are
so that my team can collect you without any more theatrics.
Your friend goes about his business,
you help me with mine,
and we all get a happy ending."

Iñacio hefted the sprayer and aimed it at the bot.
"Now, now,"
the governor's voice chided.
"I have no idea if that still works and neither do you.
Even if it does,
you're sixty meters underground and breathing recycled air.
Do you really want to set things on fire?"

Iñacio hesitated.
"I s'pose not," he said,
setting it down beside the dolly.
And then casually,
as if it was the most natural thing in the world,
he slipped the loops of cables off the two sentry bots harnessed that had been pulling them
and shouted,
"Get 'em!"

The bots didn't move.

The governor's voice chuckled.
"Did you really think that would—"

"Target!"
Iffy snapped,
pointing.
The gun on the back of the three-legged bot barked twice.
The first shot punched a hole through the service bot.
The second caught it off-center and sent it spinning across the floor.

"What—"
Iñacio started.

"You just gotta know how t' talk to 'em,"
Iffy said,
grabbing a couple of tools out of her crate and stuffing them into her pockets.
"C'mon.
We gotta get a leg on."

The tunnel at the other end of the bunker had a blast door
to match the one that had closed behind them.
Iffy closed her eyes and rooted around in her not-memories of this place.
There.
She traced a shape on a contact pad beside the door,
then gasped as it slid open to reveal a pair of Marines,
their gun-arms pointed straight at her and Iñacio.

"Oh rabbit,"
the governor's voice said,
and for a moment Iffy could almost believe the sympathy in his voice was genuine.
"Did you really think you could find a hole deep enough to hide from *me*?"

Iffy felt rather than saw the three-legged bot begin to move.
"No!" she shouted,
lunging to stop it
as if it was a pet rat or a drone she had just spent hours building out of spare parts.
Its gun fired twice
but it was already falling as the Marines' auto-targeted shots
hit the knee joint in its remaining front leg.

She was falling too.
Something had knocked the breath out of her.
She was lying on the concrete and it *hurt*,
it hurt so much that she couldn't even cry out,
not yet,
because the shot had gone right through her
just above her hip
and when she tried to breathe it felt like someone was kneeling on her back
and squeezing all the air out of her.

Iñacio was shouting her name.
She was pretty sure it was Iñacio.
She could hear the governor's voice barking order too.
"No, don't," she tried to say
as exoskeletoned arms picked her up,
but the words came out as a gasp
and now she could breathe again
and the hurt spread through her like milk poured into tea.

Her head lolled to the side as the Marine placed her on a nearby work table.
Iñacio was shouting and struggling to free himself from the other Marine's grip,
which was working about as well as the time
she had tried to pull herself free from Aunt Naggie
after having her first and only temper tantrum outside the Sandhus' shop
when she was eight years old.
She couldn't remember what she had wanted so badly,
but it didn't matter.

The Marine who had picked her up had put a patch on her arm
to take the pain away
except it was more like taking her away from the pain.
She floated inside her own body as if it was a warm bath
while the Marine sliced open her parka with a very sharp knife
and squeezed cold pink goo into the hole der needle gun had made.
She supposed she was lucky it had been an armor-piercing round.
She didn't think the Marine would have enough goo to fill
the hole that the other kind would have made.

*«unanticipated / unforeseen»*

"Oh there you are."
She didn't know if she had said the words out loud or not.
*Are you going to shoot me too?*

*«inspection»*

The machine thought was clouded and soft-edged instead of crystal clear.
Without warning she was suspended beside a schematic of herself,
alone in a pocket universe constructed solely for this temporary purpose.
The fractalized patches of cells scattered through her body glistened blue-white,
but there and there and there they were red,
red for danger,
red like the blood on the work table underneath her.
They would heal—the tweaks in her genes were quadruply redundant to make sure of that—but
healing would take time
and that was something she/they/the world didn't have enough of right now.

"Sh sh sh," the Marine said softly.
An armored hand brushed gently against her cheek.
Her last thought before all her thoughts went away was,
*Honesty?*

She woke in a bed—an actual bed with sheets,
not a cot or a bunk or her sleeping bag.
Gray light came through a small window set high in the wall.
It was probably too small for her to get through anyway,
she thought dully.
She frowned.
Why would she need to—oh.

She sat up and winced.
Someone had replaced her clothes with gray cotton shorts
and a matching tank top.
The bandage stuck to her stomach,
on the other hand,
was a bright, shiny blue.
She slid her hand gingerly around to her back
and felt a matching square there.

A pair of slippers waited patiently on the floor.
She turned,
wincing again,
and slid her feet into them.
Could she stand?
Yes.
She wasn't even light-headed,
though she was as thirsty as she'd ever been.
And she didn't need a bathroom nearly as much as she had
before she'd been shot,
which made her wonder about exactly what kind of care she might have received
while she was unconscious.

A dressing gown hung on the back of the door.
It was locked,
of course,
but even if it hadn't been
she wasn't quite ready to face whatever lay on its other side.
She had been *shot*.
She could have died,
and—

She sniffled angrily and wiped her face on the dressing gown.
She really had thought they could escape,
and now she just felt stupid.

She lay back down on the bed (carefully) and closed her eyes.
A moment later she squeezed her lids shut more tightly,
but it didn't help.
The schematic of herself wasn't there any more.
Nothing was,
not even a simple wireframe of a hammer.
All she could see was the dots and swirls that everyone saw behind their eyelids.

Something cold stirred in her belly.
Maybe the loss was temporary.
Maybe things had just gone back to the way they were
and images would appear when they wanted to instead of on demand.
Or maybe it was gone for good and she could get on with her life,
though she knew it couldn't ever be what it had been.
She had wanted so much to move on,
to go somewhere and be someone and have an adventure,
and now that it had actually happened she still wanted all of that,
she just wanted a choice
instead of having things happen to her.
Mysteries,
it turned out,
were a lot more fun in sims.

She didn't know who to expect if the door opened.
The governor?
If so, which one?
Not that it seemed to matter much.
Would it be Iñacio,
looking worried,
or Johnson Wales with an apology?
Or would it be Honesty?
She was pretty sure the Marine who had given her first aid
hadn't actually been Honesty,
just another teenager with a narrow chin and button nose
temporarily possessed by someone who had been dead longer than
the people frozen in the bunker had been waiting for someone to defrost their remains.

She was still thirsty,
but she was tired too,
so she closed her eyes and let sleep take her away.

She woke in an actual bed with sheets
rather than her sleeping bag on the *Guinevere*.
Gray light came through a small window high in the wall.
She sat up and winced.
Someone had dressed her in gray cotton shorts and a matching tank top.
The bandage stuck to her stomach was bright blue.
She felt on her back,
somehow already knowing she would find a matching one there.

She slid her feet into the slippers waiting on the floor
and frowned as she took the dressing gown from the back of the door
and slid her arms into the sleeves.
She had never worn slippers or a dressing gown in her life—she only knew them
from Aunt Naggie's romance sims.
But it all felt somehow familiar,
as did her thirst.

She sat back down on the bed and closed her eyes,
willing a schematic of herself to appear.
Nothing happened.
All she could see was the dots and swirls that everyone saw.

*Phosphenes,* she thought.
They were called phosphenes,
but how did she know that?
Panic roiled in her gut,
cold and slippery as if she had somehow swallowed a live jellyfish.

That thought pulled her back to her feet.
She knew the door would be locked,
but she tested the handle anyway.
"Well shad," she said aloud as it opened with a faint click.

The hall outside was as featureless as her room.
The floor was tiled with squares of slate-colored linoleum
just like the ones in the Sandhus' store.
The walls and ceiling were iceberg gray.
She couldn't see where the light was coming from
or how far the corridor went:
it seemed to stretch away forever in both directions.
The doors were rectangular outlines with handles
identical to the one that had just closed behind her with another faint click.

"Hello?"
She took a step, then hesitated.
She was sure the lettering on the door opposite her hadn't been there a moment before.
Was it motion-sensitive?
She stepped back:
the letters stayed visible.
They definitely *were* letters,
so why couldn't she read them?

"Hello?" she said again.
Her words disappeared without an echo as if she had never spoken,
but now she could hear something in the distance
like the steady *shush shush shush* of waves against the side of a ship.
That sound had been a constant background in her life
for as long as she could remember,
just like the smell of the sea.

The smell.
She could smell the ocean.
Wherever she was,
she was close to salt water.
Halley?
Rothera?
Another secret hideout somewhere?
There seemed to be a surprising number of those scattered around Antarctica,
although to be honest,
she wasn't really sure how many would have been unsurprising.

She hesitated again before grasping the handle in front of her.
It resisted for a moment, then turned with a click and pulled it open.

The room inside was identical to the one she had woken up in,
right down to the rumpled sheet on the bed.
All of a sudden she was tired as well as thirsty,
so she lay down on it and closed her eyes and let sleep take her away.

She woke in an actual bed with sheets.
Gray light came through a small window.
The bandage stuck to her stomach under her gray cotton tank top was bright blue.
Its twin tugged at the skin on her back
as she kicked the slippers on the floor aside and opened the door.
The hall outside was tiled with slate-colored linoleum squares.
*Just like the Sandhus',* she thought.
The light came from nowhere in particular,
painting the walls and ceiling iceberg gray.

The door behind her closed with a faint click.
There was lettering on the door opposite her,
but opening it felt—she lowered her hand.
She and Jeep had played hive a few times.
The thought of opening the door gave her the same feeling as
the thought of placing a piece exactly where her opponent wanted her to.

The corridor stretched away to infinity in both directions.
Waves shushed in the distance
and the tang of salt water tickled her nose
as she considered her options.
It all seemed familiar.
How many times had she been here before?
How many of these doors had she opened,
only to find herself back in the room she had left?

Sometimes the only way to win was not to play.
She sat on the floor with her back against the wall and closed her eyes.
Phosphenes danced behind her eyelids.
She hugged herself so that her hands were hidden in her armpits
and pinched hard.
That felt real,
but that didn't mean anything.
If this was some kind of virtual reality,
whatever machine she was plugged into could simulate a pinch
just as easily as it could make her believe
there was a wall behind her back
or that she was thirsty.

"I ain't playin' no more," she said aloud.
The corridor swallowed her words without even a trace of an echo.
She wrapped her arms around her knees and put her head down on her knees to wait.

Her shoulders tensed involuntarily when she heard a door open somewhere in the distance.
She kept her head down as footsteps approached.
Fabric rustled as someone sat opposite her.

"You really are quite extraordinary,"
the governor said without preamble.
"If circumstances were different I would probably offer you a job of some sort."
He chuckled.
"I suspect that if I did that,
I would be working for *you* in rather short order."

Iffy didn't move.

"I'm not actually a villain,"
the governor continued gently.
"I admit I've done some terrible things,
but every single one of them was absolutely necessary.
Things are getting worse,
Citizen Kwan,
and we still can't see the bottom of the pit.
Every time we think we've patched a hole in the world,
entropy breaks through in a dozen other places.
Your ecologist and his friends think they can save enough to start over,
but simulation after simulation says they're wrong.
Even the machines seem to be afraid these days,
though what they seem to be afraid of most,
surprisingly,
is you."

Fabric rustled again as he stood.
"For what it's worth,
I'm sorry.
If there was another way to do this—"

Iffy waited for him to finish his sentence.
The moment stretched and stretched.
"Are you gonna kill me?"
she asked,
her voice muffled by her knees.

"No,"
the governor said neutrally.
"You're just not going to be yourself for a while."
He sighed.
"Quite a long while, in fact.
Goodbye, Citizen Kwan.
Believe it or not,
it has been a pleasure."

Without warning her thirst was back,
more powerful than ever before.
She was almost grateful as she fell into something deeper and darker than sleep.

## Chapter 13

They only had to deploy four of their home-made EMPs,
but that was enough to get them to the top floor.
They used the fifth to knock someone off-balance long enough
for the sentry bot to knock der out of the way.
When they rounded a corner and ran headlong into a couple of Marines
they shouted, "Grenade!" and pitched the last one underhand,
then fled in the opposite direction
as the pair ducked into a nearby doorway for shelter.

Sergeant Vassilenko,
or whoever was in the body he'd been wearing when they first met him,
was on guard by the exit.
His mouth worked as he tried to yell at her to stop,
but his imprint still hadn't fully taken hold.

*Let me do this,* Sandrine thought.
He was bigger than they were,
but his punches and kicks were jerky and uncoordinated.
Hers were not:
she blocked,
blocked again,
punched hard,
and then swept his feet out from under him.

The exit was locked.
The hinges were on the inside
and big enough for the sentry bot to grasp.
Outside was colder than they expected and shadowed instead of sunshine-bright.

They shielded their eyes with the palm of their hand.
"What the hell?" Sandrine said.
The buildings around them were burned-out shells.
Soot and scorch marks had been faded by time,
but that just made them even uglier.

*It's Bharati,* Iffy thought.
*There was a fire here.
Whole bunch o' people died.*

"Not all of them,"
Sandrine muttered,
thinking about what Private Leung had said about Sergeant Vassilenko.
Both of their bodies were the right age to have been children twenty years ago.
"How much time do we have?"

*Couple more minutes 'til everythin's back online.
We gotta go that way.*
Their arm jerked to point.
With the sentry bot loping along at her heels,
they set off at a run.

She had never been to Bharati before,
or if she had,
it had been a different copy of her,
but it was immediately familiar.
The long cindered arc across the front of that building—that
was a Gatling laser tracking a fast-moving target.
The shattered remains of a concrete wall spread across the road a block later
had the half-melted edges left by a high-temperature blast.
She had used weapons like that herself against both people and machines.
The rectangular tread marks spaced at half-meter intervals under her running feet
had been left by something heavy.
The crater where they ended told her what its fate had been.

*They'll have exos an' drones back online any second.*
Iffy thought.

Sandrine nodded.
*That still feels weird,* Iffy thought.

"Sorry," Sandrine puffed.
She ducked into what might once have been a neighborhood temple and crouched down.
The sentry bot came to a stop beside her.
"Your turn."

If someone had asked,
Sandrine would have said that she stepped back and let Iffy take over.
It wasn't like that, though.
It was more like fading away a little so that Iffy could become more real.
As their hands opened the side of the sentry bot and made a few adjustments,
she wondered if this was what it would be like as her imprint subsided.
Would she feel more and more transparent until there was no trace of her left?
How many times had copies of her gone through that?

"I don't think it's like that most o' the time."
It was Iffy's turn to speak aloud.
She sounded distracted to Sandrine,
which might have had something to do with the red warning label
on the power supply in the sentry bot's torso
that she was tweaking with a screwdriver,
a shim of metal bent on itself to make tweezers,
and enough muttered curses to supply an entire brigade of Marines.

"Jeep an' others,
it's like bits o' them got put in storage an' replaced with bits o' you for a while.
I figure th' two of us bein' like this is down to whatever's in me
that th' governor's so excited t' get his hands on."
She reattached the last of the wires she had pulled free
and took a deep breath.
"Wasn't sure that would work," she confessed.
"I mean,
not blow us up."

*It's your body if you do,* Sandrine thought,
and then,
*I'm sorry.
That they did this to you, I mean.
They shouldn't have.*

"Weren't your fault," Iffy grunted,
straightening up.
"An' t' tell you th' truth,
I'm glad I got t' meet you.
I figure if you're who's in Honesty's head,
she'll be aright.
Now,
let's go blow stuff up."

She patted the sentry bot's back and pointed back the way they had come.
"Go."
As the bot loped away she said,
"Aright, your watch."

*Thanks.*
Sandrine rolled her/their/Iffy's head from side to side
and started running.
They didn't have much time,
and that hovercraft wasn't going to steal itself.

The scientists and engineers who erected the first building at Bharati Station
played a single game of cricket in the snow
so that they could send pictures of it back to their families.
As the temperature and other buildings both went up in the years and decades that followed,
those games became a regular fixture of station life.
And when people began bringing their families with them
to escape the droughts, floods, and communal warfare of their homeland,
the proposal to build a proper cricket pitch
went from a standing joke to a unanimously-approved item in the town plan.

Sandrine doubted the stadium's architects had realized that
such a large, covered space would be a perfect place to hide an oversized hovercraft
from passing satellites.
She was more concerned with how sketchy Iffy's plan for pirating it was.
She had heard,
"We'll figure it out when we get there,"
before several missions when she was herself.
None of them had gone well,
but it was too late for second thoughts now.

*Boom!*
They felt the explosion as much as they heard it.
Somewhere behind them,
the sentry bot's power cells had reached their limit and then some.
She doubted it would slow their pursuers down by much,
but every second counted.

There were no guards at the stadium.
Why would there be?
They were hundreds of kilometers from the nearest settlement,
and anyone capable of crossing that expanse
would not have been slowed down by a couple of shivering Marines.

*What if they haven't fixed the coolant pumps?*
Sandrine thought
as Iffy took control of her/their body
and slithered underneath the hovercraft's armored ground-effect skirt.

"Then we better hope th' governor has a sense o' humor,"
Iffy grunted.
With a screwdriver in one hand and something that looked like
a cross between a ratchet wrench and a tuning fork in the other,
she set to work.

Moments later a panel barely wider than her/their shoulders clanged open.
*That's for maintenance drones, isn't it?*

"Yup,"
Iffy said aloud as she tucked her tools back into her/their pockets.
"Hope you don't mind a squeeze."

The duct was just wide enough to wriggle through.
They were stuck at a corner for one terrifying moment,
and in another spot they had to slide forward,
roll over,
stuff their legs into a side duct,
and roll over again in order to be able to move forward.
There was no light,
of course,
and everything smelled of metal and machine oil.
Sandrine did her best to fade into the background
so that Iffy could find them a path through the schematic in her head.

*Aright,* Iffy finally thought.
*You ready?*

*Yes sir.*
One two three four thumb,
one four two three thumb.
Yes, she was ready.

*I ain't no 'sir',*
Iffy fired back.

Sandrine grinned in the darkness.
"I think you would have made a fine officer.
Here we go."
She kicked out the grill at her/their feet
and dropped into the hovercraft's auxiliary engineering station.

The station was bigger than the duct they had just been crawling through,
but not by much.
Apps were securely bolted onto three walls,
and a harness hung on the door behind them.
There was a helmet too,
in case the ride got so bumpy that concussion might be an issue.
Iffy buckled herself in and closed her eyes.

Schematics appeared,
red and blue and sizzling-bright white,
each surrounded by a swirling flock of information.
She grinned at Sandrine's double-take.
*Still feels that way m'self,* she thought as she dove in.
There and there and there—outer hatches locked as engines rumbled to life.
Two people were in the cockpit and a third was already on der way to her station
with a handgun and—an ax?
Really?
Why would anyone have an ax on board a hovercraft?

It didn't matter.
No one had thought to grab a breathing mask,
so she told the hovercraft's core that every single corridor was engulfed in flames.
Choking and swearing,
the tech who had been headed her way retreated into a cabin
whose door locked a moment before de realized der mistake.

The two in the cockpit were going to be more of a problem.
There were manual overrides in case anyone did
exactly what she was now doing,
but she would worry about them later.
A dozen tiled views in the app on her left told her that the Marines had arrived.
Unlike the tech who was now trying to break through the door to der cabin,
they had thought ahead:
two were carrying heavy cylinders
that both she and the app's overlays identified as rocket launchers.

The hovercraft lifted and slid sideways as its turbines came to life.
"Here we go!" Iffy shouted.
The acceleration threw her forward against her harness straps
and sent a sharp stab through her abdomen.
Marines threw themselves out of the hovercraft's way
as it lurched backward out of the stadium,
knocked a bit of concrete off a pillar that had clearly seen worse,
spun,
and roared out of town.

*Drones at four o'clock,* Sandrine thought.

"What?" Iffy glanced at the clock in the corner of the app.
"It's only—"

*Back and right.*
Sandrine nudged Iffy's eyes to a tile showing the sky behind them.

"Yeah, well, good luck to 'em,"
Iffy said distractedly.
Image after image flashed across the app in front of her.
There—that one.
She fired a rapid stream of instructions at the hovercraft
and unbuckled her harness.

And promptly collapsed.
*We're bleeding,* Sandrine thought calmly.
*And our blood pressure—wait, no, don't try to stand up.*

"Gotta…"
Iffy struggled and then slumped back onto the deck.
She felt nauseous and so, so tired
and there was something wet on her face,
something dripping.

*Nosebleed,* Sandrine confirmed.
*And if our heart beats any faster we're probably going to pass out.
Let me take over.*

Iffy shook her head.
"Ow," she whimpered.

*Let me do this,* Sandrine urged.
Without waiting for an answer she poured herself into Iffy's arms and legs
and grabbed hold of the harness
to haul herself/themself onto her/their feet.
No,
her feet,
she was the one standing.
She had walked home from school one day with a fever
as yet another mutant flu swept across the world.
The teacher had passed out at his desk,
wheezing with each sweaty breath.
She remembered one of her classmates saying they should stay
and wait for someone to tell them what to do,
but somehow she had known that no one was coming.

Open the door.
Steady yourself on the frame.
Come on, soldier, you have a mission.
Left foot, right foot, left right left.
Open the door.
No,
don't bother to close it behind you.
There is no "behind".
There's only forward to the next door,
the one that matters.
Open it.
Fall into the waiting chair.
Straps—I know, I know,
your hands feel like a bunch of bananas
(*You had bananas?*)
but you have to do up the straps.
Button—there's a button you need to push.
Which button?
That one's big and red and right there.
You missed.
Come *on* soldier, you can do this.
Try again.
Make a fist.
Up and…down.

Weight on her chest pressed her into the chair.
There was sunlight all around her.
Her last thought before slipped away into nothingness was,
"Good luck, kid—say hi the next time you see me."

Iffy felt an upside-down ache in her chest when she finally regained consciousness
and knew immediately that Sandrine was gone.
"Thank you," she whispered.
She wiped tears, snot, and blood off her face and looked dully out the escape pod's windows
at the tundra racing by.

It wasn't technically an escape pod—the hovercraft's schematics labeled it
a PN-420 single-seat rapid reconnaissance vehicle—but
that's what Sandrine had called it when Iffy pulled it up in her head.
"Figures,"
the Marine had said.
"Someone like the governor is always going to have a back door in case they need it."
And then she had whistled.
"Looks like a nice ride, too."

And it was,
though it was noisier than Iffy had expected.
Two fuel cells,
a motor,
a ground-effect skirt made of blast-resistant material,
a well-cushioned seat beneath a curved plastic window,
three independent communication systems in place of the weapons it would usually carry,
and a double helping of rations and first-aid supplies
made it feel like something out of a sim.
All she needed was a mask, a cape, a catchy name,
and a loyal combat bot as a butler slash love interest
and she'd be ready to save the world.

The first step,
apparently,
was to clean her face.
Nobody ever had to do that in a sim,
Iffy thought as she fumbled in the medical kit for something absorbent.
People got shot,
people bled,
but no one ever got *messy*.

She brought up a map on the navigation app in front of her.
A blue dot in the center was her location.
Elevation lines and a dusty sparkling overlay showed
the foothills ahead
and the clouds above her.
She thought briefly about connecting to the drones circling Bharati
to check for pursuit,
but no.
The governor would have made the pod as close to unfindable as he could.
Even the gentlest ping would give its location away.

"Shad."
She shook her head.
Of *course* the pod didn't have a toilet.
She tossed the bloodied wipe into the recycler,
closed her eyes,
and let her head fall forward again.

The next time she woke
she was almost three hundred kilometers closer to Halley.
The map showed an unfinished road bed up ahead.
*Too obvious,* she imagined Sandrine saying in her head,
so she drew a line on the app with her finger
to steer the pod toward the coast.
It wouldn't be stable on ocean waves,
but a beach or calm inshore water would be doable,
and all of a sudden she missed the ocean.

*«status interrogative update compliance»*

"Shut up," she muttered.
"I'm doin' my best.
An' anyway,
where were you when I needed you?"

A floor plan of the governor's hidden base in Bharati appeared behind her eyes.
Symbols skittered this way and that
leaving phosphorescent lines of probability in their wake.
A clogged drain meant this Marine was too far away to intervene
when Iffy made her escape.
Imprinting glitches made two others too shaky to help with the pursuit,
and—

"Aright, aright, thank you."
Iffy shook her head.
"Could'na done it without you,
an' if you can keep up th' good work
I'll try t' figure out what th' hell I'm gonna do next."

Half-way between Bharati and Halley
the escape pod startled a small herd of shaggy brown caribou.
The map zoomed in automatically to show
the red dots that appeared without warning
as the animals scrambled to their feet and gallopped away on long, ungainly legs.
"Disable targeting," Iffy snapped
as ranges and elevations blossomed on the app.
They couldn't hurt her.

The caribou made her think about Iñacio,
and thinking about Iñacio made her feel sad.
She and Sandrine had tried to come up with a two-person escape plan,
but without knowing where he was…

The comm system chose that moment to bleeble.
"Wide-channel transmission accept Y/N" appeared on the app.
Feeling reckless,
Iffy swiped to accept.

"Citizens of Antarctica,"
the governor's voice said warmly over a montage of images
from Halley and Rothera and other, smaller settlements.
"I know the recent turmoil has been difficult for all of us,
but thanks to the assistance provided by our friends from the Federated Republics,
I am pleased to say that order has now been restored in most districts.
I deeply regret the loss of life and property,
and I promise there will be a full inquiry as soon as conditions permit."

His voice hardened as "92% confidence" scrolled across the bottom of the app.
"Unfortunately,
our troubles are not yet completely behind us.
While the former governor of Halley chose to turn himself in
to order to avoid further strife,
the former governor of Paddington South is still at large.
We believe he is now working with a machine collaborator named Fifth Ang Kwan."
The pictures of cobbled streets vanished
and were replaced by stills and videos of Iffy.

"This person is extremely dangerous,"
the governor went on,
oblivious to the shock and outrage on Iffy's face.
"She has been implicated in several acts of sabotage,
and may be able to control or subvert any sentient machinery in her vicinity."
The video of French Henry twitching and shaking on damp gray cobblestones
appeared in an inset on one side of the app.
In another,
a scanner bot knocked one Marine off der feet while a sentry bot tangled itself
in another Marine's exoskelton.

"If you see her,
do not approach her yourself!
For your own safety and the safety of others,
please contact the authorities.
We will do everything in our power to apprehend her without further loss of life."

He went on a little longer about standing together
and how the brave spirit that all Antarticans shared
could never be extinguished,
but Iffy was too angry to pay attention.
Too angry and then suddenly afraid as well.
What had they done to Aunt Naggie?

*Do y' know where she is?* she thought desperately,
but the machines didn't reply,
not even when she added *please*.

The escape pod's engines thrummed a deeper note for a few minutes
as it raced along a stream.
Iffy wiped her face on her sleeve.
The pod had two little drones,
each the size of her fist.
She could afford to use one to get a message out
without giving away her position.
The thought of what she had to say left an ugly taste in her mouth,
but all her choices were behind her now.

"Record for playback," she ordered the pod's app,
then said what she needed to say.

The sign outside Buhr called it "the best little town south of 60".
Someone had added, "Population: 0" decades ago
when the mine closed down
and the handful of people still hanging on
were relocated to other settlements.
Iffy knew she couldn't stop there—by  now,
anything marked on the map would be under surveillance—but
it was the closest spot to her with a name.

She did her best to park the escape pod in the shadows beneath a small cliff,
wincing when its side scraped against stone.
"Camouflage full," she told its little core,
then lifted the plastic windshield on its hydraulic hinges and clambered out
as the pod did its best to make itself invisible.

The ground was sandy and slightly damp.
A few tufts of grass had managed to colonize it,
but they already turned brown and stiff.
Winter was coming.
She shivered and wished she dared to light a fire.
She felt more alone on the tundra than she ever had at sea,
and she missed Sandrine.

*«delivery confirmed»*

"Thanks," she said aloud.
Machine thoughts appearing in her mind wasn't the same as having someone to talk to,
but to her surprise it actually felt better than nothing.

An hour went by.
She saw two birds in the distance,
though they might just have been spotter drones searching for her,
and something the size of an arctic hare
scurried from one tuft of grass to another at one point.
When the pod's app finally pinged she stood up,
tossed another piece of gravel at the blotch on the cliff
she had decided was the governor's face,
and wriggled back into her seat.

A single word waited for her: "agreed".
The trace attached to it showed that
those six letters had been scrambled using the key she had sent in her message
and scattered across fifteen different airborne and orbital relays
in order to reach her.
It wasn't a guarantee,
but as Uncle Jack reminded people,
there weren't any in this life and even fewer in the next.

She checked the time.
She had six hours.
She wasn't interested in any of the pod's sims,
she didn't have any tools,
and she had satisfied her craving for a toilet an hour ago,
so she closed her eyes and let herself float away from her exhausted body.

*She was on deck.
The sky was a perfect blue,
and her olders were stuffing her into her ecosuit.
"Just in case, love," Second said, forcing a smile.*

*"No," Iffy said fiercely, wriggling free.
"I can help!"*

*"It's too late," Second said sadly.
"It's always been too late, love."*

*Iñacio nodded and patted the six-legged bot bumping its camera array against his knee.
"You can't fix the world, Iffy.
Nobody can."*

*"We can try!" she said fiercely.
"Th' governor an' th' machines an', an' everybody,
they wouldn't be chasin' me like this if they din't think there was a chance
I could do somethin'.
An' even if I can't—"*

She knew she was dreaming,
but even in her dreams she'd never dared to say this before.
*Even if I can't, I gotta make it mean somethin'.
Livin' when you didn't an' all th' shad Aunt Naggie's put up with
an' what happened to Jeep an' Honesty an', an' Sandrine—if I don't try,
none of it mattered.
Now shut up an' let me sleep.*

The pod woke her five hours later.
She yawned and stretched as well as she could in her chair,
wrinkling her nose at her own muggy smell.
The next time she risked her life to save the world,
or whatever,
she was going to make sure showers were available.
Real showers,
not just the stinging mist she had grown up with on the *Guinevere*.
And toilets and fresh vegetables and a galley and a machine shop
and big, firm slaps of foam to sleep on instead of cots and padded chairs.

A swipe and a couple of taps brought up a map of her surroundings.
The train from Rothera to Zhongshan would pass through Buhr in fifty-eight minutes.
It would slow down briefly just east of her
where the track bent in a long arc around the old mining pit.
There would be drones overhead:
even if nobody was looking for her,
scavs and jackers were a constant low-level headache for long-haul freight.
Her pod's dazzle wouldn't be able to hide it
if it tried to match speed with the train,
so it was a good thing it wouldn't have to.
She swallowed the last mouthful of a sugary high-protein ration bar,
thought wistfully again about the *Guinevere*'s galley
and Aunt Naggie's noodles,
and told the pod to start its engines.

*As the hovercraft lifted, pivoted, and began to accelerate,
something the size and shape of an arctic
raised its head cautiously from its hiding place behind a tuft of grass.
Sunlight glinted off its head
where an old scrape had torn false fur away from its metal skull.
One glass eye tracked the visitor's departure,
and then it disappeared back into its hole to wait for its next mission.
If its little core had been sophisticated enough for emotion
it might have felt a sense of satisfaction for having done its duty.
The fact that nothing had been listening to its broadcasts for decades
would have been irrelevant.*

The pod would have steered a course parallel to the train track.
A half-memory of a sim she had once played prompted Iffy
to make it randomize their path instead.
She didn't think it would actually make a difference,
but it took her mind off things for a few moments.
She was more nervous than she had been escaping from Bharati.
Some of it was not having Sandrine there to talk to,
but what if—

*Uh uh.*
She shoved her worries into a mental locker as firmly as she could.
A thousand things could go wrong and at least a couple probably would.
There was nothing she could do about any of them right now.

Ten minutes.
There were lots of places to hide in the grass-grown wasteland
of the old mining pit,
but that was too obvious to be safe.
The train's drones would have recorded every tuft and pebble
each time they passed by.
Even the slightest change would be flagged and investigated.

The same was true of Buhr itself,
but the little stream that ran alongside the tracks was another matter.
The soil around it was loose enough to make minor slumps and potholes a regular occurrence.
With luck,
those frequent changes would convince whoever or whatever might be watching
that her camouflaged pod was just another bit of entropy.
She set down next to a particularly unstable-looking arc of sand and started a countdown.

Two minutes.
The pod's vibration sensor painted a green trace on the map
that solidified as the core became more certain of its epicenter.
Sixty seconds.
If she climbed out of the pod and stood on top of it
she would be able to see a dot on the horizon.
She stayed put.
One two three four thumb,
one four two three thumb.
She grinned as she caught herself tapping
the rhythm Sandrine used to calm herself.

Thirty seconds.
The pod's speakers relayed the quiet shush of the approaching train.
Twenty.
Ten,
and suddenly it was loud enough to drown out conversation,
just for a count of five,
and then the train had passed
leaving just a final dwindling shush in its wake.

Aright.
If this was a sim it would be the perfect time for the main character to deliver
a punchy catchphrase.
Too bad it was her real life.
She slid back the plastic windshield and climbed out of the pod
with a blocky remote in one hand
and a bottle of water in the other.

Three hundred and eighty kilometers an hour was just over a hundred meters per second,
which meant that even with precise timing
the person she was looking for
could be a kilometer in either direction.
This stretch of tundra was flat enough that she could see much further than that,
so the real problem would be how camouflaged he was.

"Hi."
Iffy jumped and whirled around at the voice behind her
just in time to see Johnson Wales straighten up and brush dirt off his hands.

"Sorry,"
he said.
"I didn't mean to startle you."

"Yes you affin' did,"
Iffy snapped.
"No, wait, stay right there."
She raised her her remote and bottle.
"Come any closer an' I'll dose us both."

Wales frowned.
The tech in his temples sparkled for a moment.
"That's just water."

Iffy grinned savagely.
"Thank you—I worked hard on that.
Now show me what you brought."

"I think we should—" Wales began.

"Lemme see you right affin' now or we're both goin' t' sleep!"
She shook her bottle menacingly.

"All right."
The air beside him flickered and solidified to reveal a familiar toolbox.

"Open it up."
Wales nodded,
undid the catches,
and flipped back the lid
to reveal tools and parts packed so tightly together
that it was hard to see where each one ended and the next began.

"Aright."
Iffy jerked her chin to point.
"Town's that way.
Pretty sure they'll spot you long b'fore you get there,
but it's still a ways.
You best get movin'."

"I'm not going anywhere until we've had a chance to talk,"
Wales said calmly,
tucking his hands into his parka's pockets.

"Keep 'em out where I can see 'em!" Iffy snapped.
"An' I don't think you got much t' say that I wanna hear,
so how about you save yer breath an' my time both?"

Wales sighed.
"For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
I am,"
he continued as Iffy opened her mouth.
"I did what I thought was right at the time.
I'd probably do the same thing again in the same situation,
but the situation has changed."
He spread his hands.
"We can still save the world if you want to."

Iffy shook her bottle menacingly again.
"You must think I'm six diff'rent kinds o' stupid," she spat.
"Trusted you th' one time, not gonna trust you again."

"I did what I thought was right,"
Wales repeated.
"I thought the governor would get us to the lab and let us do what we need to.
I was wrong.
I'm sorry."
For a moment the weight of his years came through in his voice.
"I'm sorry for a lot of things."

"Not much use cryin' now."
The wind ran its fingers across the fuzz on Iffy's scalp.

Wales shrugged.
"No.
But if you really were going to blow me up or poison me
or whatever it is you're pretending that bottle's for,
you wouldn't have asked for my help."
He put his hands back in his pockets and looked at her
until she lowered her bottle and remote.

"Aright.
But before we go anywhere you're gonna tell me what that lab's really about
an' why everyone's so in'rested in me."

The corner of Wales mouth quirked up.
"Your First said almost exactly the same thing to me when I first met her,
except she had an actual gun pointed at my head.
So, once upon a time…"

"Oh no you don't.
No fairy tales."

"It's my story,
I'll tell it the way I want to."
He closed the lid of his toolbox and sat down on it,
patting a spot beside him.
Iffy just glared at him.

Wales shrugged and leaned forward to put his elbows on his knees.
"Once upon a time the world was falling apart.
Where there wasn't flood there was drought,
and both brought hunger and disease.
Forests were burning,
the oceans were rising,
species were disappearing every day,
and no matter what people did,
their models kept making the same dark predictions."

"The people responsible suffered less than most,
of course,
but they still suffered.
Some lost themselves in sims.
Others built walls to protect their little kingdoms,
and others still threw their wealth at impossible schemes like moving to other worlds.
As things got worse,
a few of us managed to convince some of them
that the only solution was to move to Hell."

"Upload themselves?"
Iffy scoffed.
"An' then what,
you take their money while they're all bein' torn apart by malware?"

Wales shook his head.
"No.
I mean,
I wouldn't have cried if that happened.
Trust me,
anyone that rich makes the governor look like a saint.
No,
the idea was that we would imprint ourselves on the entire global network
so that we could fix the things no one else could.
People had tried it before,
but…"
He shrugged.
"We thought we had a couple of new angles,
and we were desperate."

He stared past her at the horizon.
"So we did the whole mad scientist thing with a secret underground lair
and a double-secret lab underneath that
and locked the door behind us.
Nothing in, nothing out, just two dozen of the smartest human beings alive
and enough equipment to settle on Mars."
He chuckled and pointed at his chest.
"Did I ever tell you that's actually what I was supposed to do?
All my genetic tweaks and this stuff in my head—it's all left over
from some previous bunch of mad scientists and *their* plan for saving the world."

"So what happened?"
Iffy asked despite herself after a few moments of silence.

"We had a vote,"
Wales said bleakly.
"We weren't ready,
but honestly,
we didn't know if we ever would be,
and things were getting worse faster than anyone had predicted.
We argued for a couple of days
and finally decided to go for it and hope for the best.
Everyone listened to their favorite music one last time
or had one last cup of coffee
and made jokes about seeing each other in the next life,
and then we climbed into our capsules and closed our eyes.
The next thing I knew I was on the floor of Beta Station
and everyone else was dead.
Everyone except you."

Iffy stared at him.
"Me?"
she asked,
but somehow she already knew what he was going to say next.

"Mm hm."
He took a small app out of his pocket and swiped.
"Don't worry,
it's completely off the network.
Here."

<span id="2024-04-25-a"></span>

He turned it around and held it out.
An older version of her own face looked back at her.
"Her name wasn't Ang Kwan,"
he said quietly.
"It was Jing-mei Yuen.
And while all of us were working on our project
she somehow found a way to work on one of her own.
She's the only other person from the team who survived.
Your First was a tweaked clone of her,
and I think she's the reason the machines woke up."

She burst out laughing.
After a moment Wales began to chuckle too.
"Well, it's not quite the reaction I was expecting,"
he started.

"You—you—"
Iffy hiccupped.
"You're skew.
D'you seriously 'spect me t' b'lieve that?"
She lowered her voice.
"Oh, Iffy, you're th' chosen one.
Only you can save th' world."

"Your First said pretty much the same thing before she shot me,"
Wales observed drily,
tapping his chest with one finger.
"It took me twenty years to track her down.
I don't know how she got to Cape Town or what happened to Jing-mei.
All I know is that she had the same talent you do.
Somehow she could—"
He took a deep breath.
"Somehow *you* can talk to them and get them to talk back.
Not just trade deals and warnings about no-go zones but actual conversations."

"So that makes th' machine wars my fault?"
Iffy shot back angrily.

Wales cocked his head.
"How old were you when you started seeing things?
Eight?
Nine?
If your First got her abilities at the same age,
that would be almost exactly the time the machines woke up.
It's quite a coincidence."

"And there's another thing,"
he continued as she opened her mouth to protest.
"I'm good with tech—really good by most people's standards—and
the people and cores working for the governors are at least as good.
We should have been able to track you and your elders down in minutes,
but somehow you all managed to stay hidden."

He looked up at the sky as if he could see the machines' satellites orbiting overhead.
For all Iffy knew, he actually could.
"Someone up there likes you, Iffy.
Someone or something has been looking out for you your whole life."

A lifetime of hurt and anger boiled up inside Iffy.
"Go t' hell,"
she spat.
"Wasn't anyone lookin' out for th' *Guinevere* when she went under
an' everyone drowned.
Wasn't anyone lookin' out for me 'cept Aunt Naggie when we were in dock
an' th' other kids knocked me around 'cuz I was bad luck.
What I got,
I got 'cuz o' *me*,
not some— some—"
She wiped her sleeve angrily across her face.

"I'm sorry,"
Wales said for the third time.
"I wish I'd been there."

For a minute the only sound was the wind and the distant *skee-rawk* of a lonely gull.
"Why'd she shoot you?"
Iffy finally asked.

Wales shrugged.
"I didn't give her a chance to get to know me
before I dumped the whole save-the-world thing on her shoulders.
And when she said no,
I tried to make her do it anyway.
That was a mistake."

Something clicked in Iffy's head.
"So bumpin' into me at th' Sandhus…"

"Wasn't exactly by chance, no.
But the drugs you've been getting?
Those are straight from the machines.
I stole a few grains once when you were younger, and—"
He shrugged again.
"Like I said, I'm pretty good with tech,
but I have no idea what it does or how the tweaks inside you work.
All I know is that I'm a hundred and forty-one years old
and I'm tired of making things worse."

He patted the toolbox.
"I brought everything you asked for.
What happens now is up to you.
If you want my help, it's yours.
If you want me to walk away and let you do this yourself,
I'll do that instead.
People like me and the governors,
we've had our chance.
It's your turn now."

Iffy drummed her fingers on the palm of her hand.
One two three four thumb,
one four two three thumb.
"Aright," she said.
"Let's go save th' affin' world."

## Chapter 14

It took half an hour to collect the other two bags that Wales had thrown off the train.
Iffy didn't ask how he had snuck aboard without being detected,
or how he had managed to get off.
As they trudged back to the waiting escape pod her thoughts were on her First.
Third had mostly looked after her with Fourth's occasional grudging help.
Iffy could remember an old woman with dark eyes and a sun-wrinkled face,
but that was about all.

Dinner was a double helping of cold ration bars.
*At least these ones taste diff'rent,*
Iffy thought as she chewed and swallowed.

Wales waited until she was done before giving her the rest of his news.
Halley's governor was locked away somewhere,
Paddington's was missing,
Brazilian ships were patrolling the coast,
and the *Guinevere* was still docked in Rothera.
"As bait," he shrugged.

She nodded and gave him an abbreviated version of her escape with Iñacio
and what had happened in Bharati.
His expression soured when she described the imprinted soldiers she had encountered.
"I've always wondered what actually happened.
But yours is just…gone?"

Iffy shrugged.
"I think so.
Can't talk t' her no more,
an' I don't think I got any o' her skills.
Tell you th' truth,
I kinda miss her.
It was like havin' a big sister or somethin'."
She hesitated.
"Any chance you seen Aunt Naggie or Honesty?
De got der call-up just before things blew up."

"You can blame the governor for that," Wales said.
"When Rothera's core told him you two were a thing
he thought he could der for leverage.
I'm sorry I didn't—"

"Stop sayin' that."
Iffy crumpled the ration bar's wrapper into a ball
and stuffed it into the little recycler Wales had unpacked.
"Stop sayin' you're sorry about this an' you regret that an' whatever.
It don't fix anything."

"Sorry,"
Wales said after a moment's pause,
then spread his hands when Iffy glared at him.

He stood and stretched.
"We probably shouldn't stay here much longer.
How about I rig myself a seat on this crash bucket of yours
while you figure out what we're going to do next?"

"I already know th' what,"
she said.
"What I gotta figure out is how."
She hesitated,
remembering what had happened when she and Sandrine had stolen the hovercraft.
"Don't s'pose you brought any o' my medicine with you?"

Wales shook his head.
"Sorry, but—okay, okay, um,
*unfortunately* it would have been too risky.
As far as I know the only supply in Rothera is on board your ship,
and if I'd tried to get it…"
He shrugged,
not needing to finish his sentence.

"Yeah."
Iffy rummaged around for a moment,
then pulled a sterile wipe out of the escape pod's medical kit,
tore it in half,
and stuffed the pieces in her nostrils.
"Here we go."

*Imagine being born with cataracts in your eyes,
unable to see anything more than blurs of light.
Now imagine that one day someone removed them.
You would still only see blurs
because your brain would never have had a chance to learn that
this pattern is a wall
and this other pattern is a chair.
People might have told you that things looked smaller if they were far away,
but the words alone wouldn't mean anything.
It would be weeks or months before you could make sense of
the signals your eyes were now able to send to your brain,
but it would get easier with practice.*

*Later,
lying in a sleeping bag in a tent two hundred kilometers away
while Wales spread a net of thermally superconductive cables around them
to hide the heat of their bodies from infrared sensors,
Iffy wondered whether talking to the machines was getting easier
because she had been doing it more often
or because of her time with Sandrine
or because she now knew where her ability had come from.
In the end she decided it didn't matter.
What mattered was that diving into that other world of information
felt more like opening her eyes
each time she did it.
Finding what she wanted was no more difficult now than reaching for a cup of tea,
and what had once seemed as chaotic as the Dance Hall market in Rothera
was now full of currents and rhythms and poetry.
She didn't understand it yet,
but for the first time she felt that she might.*

*And for the first time,
she had a plan.*
