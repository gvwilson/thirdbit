One step, two, three,
and then something sharp stabbed Iffy's leg.
A jolt of electricity ran through her.
She toppled over,
her muscles locked in place as the lights came back on.

"Yes sir,"
the Marine stand over her said.
"Some sort of pocket EMP.
No sir,
we're still looking,
but we have the girl."
He paused.
"Yes sir, right away.
Yes sir,
we'll have her on the truck as soon as it's done.
Yes sir—thank you, sir."

Strong hands lifted Iffy onto a stretcher.
She felt herself begin to tremble as the electric shock wore off.
*Help me!* she thought as she was rolled down a corridor,
around a corner,
through a waiting room full of frightened people scrambling to get out of the way
and down another long corridor.
*Please, I've changed my mind, I'll do whatever you want, just help me!*

No answer came.

"One, two, three."
The Marines lifted her off the stretcher and onto a cushioned table.
A woman in a white gown flicked a light across her left eye and then her right
as someone else set something cool and heavy across her forehead.
Cuffs clicked close around her wrists and ankles.

"Here, this will help."
A sharp prick stung the inside of her right elbow.
*Please,* Iffy thought one last time
before the whole world went away.

## Chapter 9

Iñacio was much better than her at hive and santorini.
He was better at another game called chess as well,
which was somewhat surprising given how often he suggested moves for Iffy
or corrected the ones she made.
She did some yoga with him,
stretching and breathing to the drone of a duduk
or the ping-pang-pong of a hanpan.
They made the most interesting meals they could from the shelter's stores,
pretended to lose themselves in sims,
and spent long hours staying out of each other's way
in the way that sailors, prisoners, and long-married couples have done
for as long such things have been.

The spiderweb of microwires threaded through the ground around the shelter
brought them news from the outside world,
though they had no way to know how much of it they could trust.
There were Zillion ships in Rothera's harbor,
but were the protests against them few and peaceful
or were the Marines trying and failing to put down an insurrection?
Had Australian troops landed in Halley,
or were the Aussie sailors who happened to be there
just being more rambunctious than usual?
Were the governors at war with each other,
and if so,
which side was Paddington South on?

Fighting was different.

The first time Iñacio said he was going to teach her how to fight,
she thought he meant in a sim.
He grinned at that,
briefly boyish,
then handed her some bandages to wrap around her hands.
He pulled his punches so much that she barely felt them,
but the frustration of never being able to land any of her own
stung more each time he dodged one of her clumsy blows.

"I think you're gettin' the hang of it,"
he said after their first hour.

"Doesn't feel like it,"
she grumbled,
annoyed at the petulance in her voice.
"An' anyway,
I don't see how it's gonna be much use against Marines 'n' machines 'n' whatnot."

Iñacio tossed his hand wraps into the wicker bin they used for laundry.
"Not everyone wears an exo,"
he said.
"An' once you got th' hang o' this,
I'll teach you a couple o' things about bots."

Seven days after they climbed down into the shelter,
Iñacio declared it was safe to open the hatch.
"Just for a bit,"
he cautioned.
"We'll get some air an' then pack up an' head out tomorrow."

The air in question turned out to be colder than Iffy expected.
Summer was coming to an end—the sun was noticeably closer to the horizon,
and she was glad for the gloves built into her jacket.
Aunt Naggie would be—she stopped and took a deep breath.
Aunt Naggie would be cleaning what she could,
getting the *Guinevere* ready to overwinter in Halley's harbor.
The two Mrs. Sandhus would be laying in stocks of pickles and preserves
and storing rectangular bags of rice and noodles
in airtight plastic bins beneath the floorboards of their store.
She hoped Jeep was helping his father,
and Honesty…

"What needs packing?"
she asked Iñacio,
tossing the last of the pebbles she had gathered into the stream.

They left the next morning after a double breakfast and one last shower each.
Iffy had a pack of her own this time,
which she firmly told herself she *wasn't* proud of.

The herd was waiting for them when they climbed out of the shelter's concealed entrance.

## Chapter 10

There were Marines on board Governor Stern's hovercraft,
all apparently imprinted with the same taciturn personality.
Two of them flanked Iñacio
as he disappeared stone-faced into the belly of the hovercraft
while the governor breezily explained to Iffy
that he was a man of his word
and that the Ecologist would be fine.
"Anyway,
it's not as if what he tried to do would actually have worked,"
he said.
Brainwipes worked very differently in real life
than they did in sims.
Deep memories would survive the EMP pulse,
just as a person's original personality survived imprinting.
As for more recent knowledge,
well,
the Shepherds had undoubtedly changed their access codes already,
and their network of shelters and greenhouses weren't actually as secret as they thought.

Iffy expected to be locked in a cell next to Iñacio.
Instead,
a Marine ushered her up steeply-laddered steps to the hovercraft's cockpit.
"Have a seat," the governor said,
gesturing at the padded chair to the left of the one he had been sitting in.
"Oh, and please, do buckle up.
This old thing was built for speed, not comfort."

Iffy limped over to the chair
and lowered herself onto it with a wince.
The governor clucked his tongue.
"I'll have someone take a look at that for you later."
Seating himself and snapping harness straps together across his chest,
he laid his hands on the apps set into the arms of his chair.

The display in front of them came to life.
A dozen views of the surrounding tundra
nestled between status displays like those Iffy had grown up with on the *Guinevere*.
Temperatures and battery reserves,
the rotational speeds of idling engines,
weather reports,
and projections from a hundred independent simulations of the next few moments
waited for attention
like courtiers waiting on a king.

"Where're we goin'?" Iffy asked sullenly.
She had loosened the straps of her harness so that she could wriggle out if she needed to,
but the straps had re-tightened themselves
as soon as she snapped the buckle closed.

"That's an excellent question,"
Governor Stern replied absently
as he rearranged the display with a few flicks of his fingers.
"Where *are* we going?
My others have never had much of an answer.
Truth be told,
I suspect they've never really believed one was needed.
Now, don't mind the noise.
I'm sure you'll get used to it."

The engines beneath them rumbled.
The hovercraft rose like a ship being lifted by a wave,
rotating smoothly on its self-made cushion of air.
Orange status lights blinked and turned green
as the sentry bots climbed back aboard.
"All accounted for, sir,"
said the Marine seated beside Iffy.

"Right, then, tally ho."
The governor flicked his fingers again
and the hovercraft shot forward like a startled seagull.

Acceleration pushed Iffy back in her seat.
Fifty klicks an hour, a hundred… two hundred…
At two hundred and fifty the numbers on the display stopped climbing
and the pressure lifted from her chest.
She took a deep breath and watched the world race by
as the hovercraft bumped and shook toward the horizon.
The only people in the world going faster than her at that preciese moment
were either on trains
or desperate enough to take to the air
and hope the machines' satellites didn't spot them.

The novelty wore off quickly.

Someone did show up
to give Iffy a patch to dull the pain in her knee and shoulder
and speed their healing.
Her eyelids grew heavy
as the drugs and timed retroviral accelerators seeped through her skin.
Even a mug of something thick and sweet that the governor called "chocolate"
wasn't enough to keep them from closing.

At least,
that's what she hoped whoever was watching her would believe.
She had learned how to keep sleep at bay on night watches long ago.
Right now,
she had some thinking to do
and she didn't want to be disturbed.

*Wireframes swam in the darkness.
The hovercraft had been built as a blockade runner in Tashkent
before the start of the machine wars.
Its heart was a reactor originally designed for use in a submarine—she
took a moment to admire the sleek, single-minded recklessness of its design—and
the motors that created its cushion of air
would have pumped fuel at hypersonic speeds
in orbital booster rockets
if history had unfolded just a little bit differently.
The hull plating was angled to deflect the energy of ballistic attacks
and threaded with microfilaments not unlike those in Iñacio's skull
to handle electronic ones.
Ventilation tubes,
triple-redundant optical wiring,
and plumbing liberated from a luxury hotel
slithered between bulkheads.*

*She flipped the wireframe upside down and rightside up,
flew through it,
spun it around.
Any of a dozen rooms or holds could have been repurposed as a cell.
For one moment she thought about reaching out to the hovercraft's core,
but no,
it would be better protected than the railgun back on the pier had been
and anyway,
she still didn't know how she had done that.
She needed a plan if she was going to rescue Iñacio.*

She yawned widely.
The images slipped away as her concentration finally conceded
to the painkillers and reconstructives.
A moment later she began to snore softly.

She woke to the smell of curried noodles,
and for a disoriented few seconds she thought she was back on the *Guinevere*
and late for her watch.
But no,
she was still buckled into her chair in the cockpit of the hovercraft.
She took the plate that the expressionless man in a Marine-blue jumpsuit offered her
and fumbled with the chopsticks
while she waited for her mind to catch up with the rest of her.

The governor was gone,
but the gently undulating tundra on the screens around her looked the same as it had.
Their speed hadn't changed either,
she noticed,
or their heading.
She did a quick calculation in her head.
If they had stayed on their original course,
they must be nearing the coast.
If they followed it east through the Shackletons
it would take them another ten hours to reach Halley,
if in fact that was where they were going.
If they turned right it would take them half again as long to get to
the crater that marked where McMurdo had once been,
and if they headed straight for Paddington South—

She shook her head and scooped some noodles into her mouth,
blowing around them as she realized they were hot *and* spicy.
Going to Halley didn't make any sense,
but since it gave her the least time it was probably what was going to happen.

She chewed thoughtfully,
then looked up at the Marine.
"It's really good,
but can I please have some more onions on it?
An' some more o' that chocolate stuff from earlier?
If that's aright,"
she added hastily.

The Marine looked at her,
his expression still as empty as the tundra.
"Good morning,
Citizen Kwan,"
the governor said pleasantly from a speaker somewhere in the cockpit.
"I'm glad to see you have an appetite."

"It's really good," she said truthfully.
"I'm just used t' more onions."

"Mm.
And of course you'd like to see more of the *Henry Lion*,
I assume."

She shrugged.
"Not much else t' do,
'less you're aright with me talkin' to Iñacio for a bit."

"I'm afraid that's out of the question for now,"
the governor said briskly.
"All right.
Private Norbu will take you down to the galley
and then show you to your cabin.
May I please ask you to forebear any dramatics?"

"What?"
she asked,
fumbling to undo the buckles on her harness.

The governor's voice sighed faintly.
"Don't do anything foolish?"

"Ah.
Sure,
aright."
She wriggled out of the straps without spilling any of her noodles,
then stood up and tested her knee.
Whatever had been in the patch seemed to have set it right.
If she had to run,
she could.
The trick now was having somewhere to run *to*.

As she stepped past Private Norbu
she slipped the metal button cover she had pried off her chair
into her pocket.

The galley was twice the size of the *Guinevere*'s
but much noisier.
The schematic in her head showed her the pipes,
drive shafts,
and optical cables
crammed into the half meter between its floor
and the foamed steel armor on the hovercraft's belly.
She could see three different ways to make trouble if she could reach them,
but she had no way to do that.
Even if she did,
they all had backups that had backups of their own.
The hovercraft was tough by design:
someone could punch a dozen shots from a heavy-duty railgun right through it
without slowing it down.

Private Norbu stood near the galley door and watched her eat.
She ignored him the same way she had learned to ignore shopkeepers
who didn't think an orphan dredger had any place in their store.
She thought briefly about trying to steal her chopsticks,
but by the time she finished her chocolate she had decided it was too risky.
They felt like aluminum,
and she could do a lot with a couple of aluminum rods,
but Private Norbu was right there
and there were probably cameras she couldn't see as well.
No,
the chopsticks were almost certainly a dead end.
The loose screw on the underside of the table,
on the other hand…

Her cabin had a fold-up bunk
and a single shallow drawer set into the bulkhead.
She picked up the app that lay on the neatly-dressed bunk
as Private Norbu closed and locked the door behind her.
It was the same model she had used as a child,
but completely locked down:
she couldn't even get the weather on it,
much less use it connect to Hell.

She kicked off her boots and lay down.
"Lights," she said after a moment.
The room dutifully went dark.

She closed her eyes.
There was no way she had the plans for every piece of hardware on the planet
stuck in her head.
Even if she did,
that wouldn't explain how she was able to talk to the machines
or how they were able to plant ideas in her mind.
She took slow, steady breaths to slow her pulse,
then tried to visualize herself.

Nothing happened at first,
or rather,
hundreds of things that weren't her formed, flew apart, and re-formed behind her eyes.
She saw something that looked like a mechanical musk ox
designed to hide in the herd,
and marvelled for a moment at
the ingenious way it emulated its organic namesake's digestive processes.
This was the *Guinevere* as she had been the day she first sailed.
That was French Henry in pieces on a workbench in Halley,
and for a moment she saw how the bot had once fitted into
an attack craft not unlike the hovercraft she was in.

And that—right there—was her.
She forgot to breathe for a moment as the image rotated slowly,
panning and zooming as her attention shifted.
In her spine,
along her nerves,
laced through her brain:
they weren't wires—those would be too easy for a scanner to spot—but rather
tiny fractalized patches of cells arranged in precisely the right way
to make her a living antenna.

And any antenna that could receive a signal could send one.

It only took her a minute to find an opening in the hovercraft's systems.
It took her another to find one that wasn't a trap,
and another hour to convince herself that she was right.
Fifteen years ago,
just a few days after she had been born,
a tech in Paddington South had replaced a reactor coolant pump
with one salvaged from an Aussie submarine
that had suffered a catastrophic loss of containment.
(Her hand twitched as if swiping an app
to toss aside the insurance reports and obituaries
that thought called up.)
The tech had cut corners to meet a deadline
(another twitch dispelled performance reviews and der eventual dismissal).
One of those corners had been a software shim
to connect the monitor's century-old software
to the hovercraft's merely elderly systems.

She studied the code tangled around the hardware
like nerves and veins around bones.
The pump's core was dumber than a seagull:
if she nudged it there and there and *there*,
it would believe that the hovercraft's reactor was going critical
and bypass its own safeties
to try to prevent disaster.
When the other pumps asked it what the hell it thought it was doing,
the long-ago tech's shoddy work would let her persuade them
that they had been ordered to shut down for maintenance.

She smiled,
not caring who might be watching through a hidden camera,
then rolled on her side and brought her hand to her mouth
as if to stifle a yawn.

The metal button cover she had stolen was stronger than she had expected.
For a moment she thought she might crack a tooth,
but then it bent enough for her to bite down and flatten it.
She spat the half-circle of metal with its two precious points
back into her hand,
rolled over again to cover the motion of slipping it back into her pocket,
and *pushed* with her mind.

Eleven point two meters away,
a pump whirred into overdrive.
Exactly three seconds later
its partners queried it,
compared the answers they received,
and powered down.
Iffy squelched the notifications they sent to the hovercraft's core
moments before they would have set off an alarm.
*Sleep well,* she thought giddily.
She had never ridden a high-speed multi-ton atomic bomb before.
She wondered how many people had,
and how many of them had lived to tell the tale.

She didn't realize her nose was bleeding
until an alarm klaxon began to blare
and she tried to stand up.
She had expected the alarm—in fact,
she was counting on it—but
she hadn't counted on being so lightheaded that
the room went distant and swam around her.
She bent over,
her elbows on the bunk and her face pressed against her forearms.

"Shad," she swore weakly.
There was a lot of blood,
even more than the time Akumé had punched her in the face
for calling der a thief
(which de had been,
but the other kids on the pier had been too smart or too afraid of der to say it).
Wiping her face with a handful of bedsheet didn't stop the steady red drip.

Iffy laughed weakly.
She had been so worried that someone would notice her stealing the button cover,
and now it turned out she needn't have bothered.
She wouldn't have to scratch herself to get a few red cells
to fool the hovercraft's genetic sensors:
she had as many as she could possibly want.

She straightened up and worked her tongue in her mouth.
It still felt like someone had replaced it with a piece of pressed jellyfish,
but the room no longer felt like an endlessly-receding tunnel from a horror sim.
She focused on the app lying on the bunk and pushed with her mind once again.
Something inside the door clicked and it slid aside.

Two minutes later she stood in front of another cabin door
and pressed her sticky hand against the contact place beside it.

"Affin' heck, girl, what happened t' you?" Iñacio asked as he stood.

"You should see the other guy," she said
grinning woozily.
"Any idea where our gear is?"

He shook his head.
"Prolly in a recycler by now anyway.
So whatta we do now?"

She jerked her chin toward the stern.
"Back an' out an' then figure th' rest out from there."

Someone was banging against one of the doors they passed.
They were shouting, too.
Iffy thought it was funny but didn't have enough energy to laugh.
At some point Iñacio had put his arm around her to help her stay upright.
He had picked up a fire extinguisher as well,
a compact red cylinder with a silver handle
whose basic design hadn't changed in centuries.
She blinked away the specs that flashed into her mind.
*Not now,* she thought.
Her nose was still dripping.
Anyone who wanted to find them could just follow the trail of drops and streaks on the floor.

"Here," she mumbled.
"…straps…"

"'Saright, 'saright, I got it,"
Iñacio said soothingly.
He turned her around and lowered her onto the molded plastic seat,
then buckled the harness across her chest
and pulled a bulky pair of goggles down over her eyes and nose.
"Bite on this,"
he told her,
pushing a mouthpiece against her lips.

Cold air filled her lungs as she breathed in.
"Ready?
No,
don' worry,
I'll be right behind you."
He took her wrists and placed her hands on the grips built into the seat.
"One… two… *three*."

She screamed into the mouthpiece as hovercraft fired the ejection seat into the air
like an old-fashioned artillery shell.
Daylight blinded her.
Ice-cold wind instantly numbed her cheeks.
Tiny gyros whined to stabilize the chair
long enough for the explosive bolts in its back to fire.
A translucent parawing snapped open.
The surge of deceleration threw her against her harness
and then she was swinging like a pendulum
as the parawing's tiny core picked a safe landing spot
and turned toward it.

The ground below her was covered with snow.
The harsh white reached from horizon to horizon,
interrupted only by a few dark boulders
and the camouflaged rectangular bulk of the hovercraft
that was already several hundred meters away.
It must have turned inland toward the pole,
but Iffy didn't have time to think about that.
She was flying,
really actually flying,
except it was going to be over in a few seconds
and if the chair hit the ground the wrong way
she might tumble and snap her neck.
The gyros were supposed to prevent that,
but she had seen their specs when she was planning her escape
and they had last been serviced by the same tech
who had screwed up the coolant pump.

A flash of light at the rear of the hovercraft
threw a black dot into the seamless blue sky.
A hundred meters above the ground it jerked suddenly
as its parawing deployed.
Iffy's fumbling fingers finally found the catch on the harness buckle.
It bleeped and flashed,
unhappy about being unfastened while in the air,
but she jammed her thumb down hard to force it open.

Snow raced away beneath her far too fast for safety.
She was headed straight for a boulder.
She was going to hit it.
She was going to hit it,
but the parawing cupped the air to brake,
throwing her hard against the straps as if to punish her for breaking its rules.

The chair landed on the snow with a crunch.
Iffy spat out the mouthpiece,
pulled off her goggles,
wriggled out of the straps,
tripped,
and fell face-first into the little snowbank thrown up by the chair's impact.
Ice crystals stung her face and hands.
It was cold,
she realized,
really cold.
They must have come a long way inland.

The chair bleeped.
Panels popped off its bulky arms
to reveal a featherweight windproof parka rolled up
to be not much larger than a lunch-sized roti on one side
and a waistpack with a tiny first aid kid,
a ruggedized app,
a pair of multitools,
and three high-energy snack bars on the other.
The specs had shown four,
and as she strapped the waistpack on
she wondered if that long-ago tech had gotten hungry while he was working.

It took her three tries to clamber up the boulder.
Her nosebleed had stopped,
leaving bits of red crust on her lip,
but she was still lightheaded.
She shielded her eyes with her hand.
There—Iñacio's chair had just landed a few hundred meters away.
The governor had undoubtedly retaken control of the hovercraft,
only to discover that all three coolant pumps had burned out
and would need to be replaced
before it could move again.
If his Marines had the same exoskeletons as the ones in Halley and Rothera,
she and Iñacio only had a few minutes before they arrived
to recapture their ex-prisoners.

"Hey!"
She waved both arms.
Iñacio waved back and started toward her.
Iffy slipped off the boulder,
made her way back to the chair,
and got to work.

The upper back plate on the ejection seat had six screws.
The lower plate only had four.
The schematic in her head didn't need them,
but she pocketed them anyway as she took them out.
"No such thing as scrap," she muttered under her breath.
It was one of Mister Mishra's favorite sayings,
but there wasn't time to think about him or Jeep
because she had to tighten the spigot valve on the seat's tiny fuel line all the way
before prying out the fist-sized tank of high-test peroxide
or she and her escape were both going to be very short-lived.

Iñacio's boots crunched on the snow a minute later.
"What're you—oh no.
No no no,
you can't be serious."

She grinned madly and pointed at the parawing
without looking up from the vernier motor she was crimping into place.
"Straighten that out if you can
an' then get the straps off th' chair.
We're gonna have t' double up."

Another minute, another minute—there.
Iñacio handed her the ends of the parawing's tether lines.
She clipped them onto the harness and handed it back to him.
"I can't carry you, so you gotta carry me," she said,
cutting off his protests.

The snow field dipped gently on the far side of the boulder.
It wasn't much,
but it would have to do.
"Ready?" she asked.

Iñacio shook his head.
"Nope."
He bent over like a sprinter and started to run.

Iffy waited for the lines to go nearly taut before shouting,
"Now!"
and yanking the edge of the parawing up as hard as she could.
The makeshift rocket strapped to Iñacio's back flared,
kicking him forward.
For an instant Iffy thought it wasn't going to work,
but the core she had pulled out of the chair wasn't smart enough to wonder
how or why its world had changed.
It just knew its wing was out of position.
Tiny motors whirred,
frantically adjusting the parawing's shape
so that it cut the air at just the right angle
to lift Iñacio into the air.

He whooped,
his feet still pedalling as they left the ground.
Iffy ran back and scrambled up the boulder and shielded her eyes,
her heart pounding.
Four black dots had come over the horizon.
She counted seconds under her breath.
The snow was slowing them down, but not much.

"Over here!" she shouted,
waving as Iñacio banked in a wide, clumsy turn.
One moment he was over *there*
and the next he was coming straight at her,
wide-eyed and shouting something she couldn't hear.
She took a deep breath and spread her arms wide.

Iñacio hit her with a thump that cracked her spine.
His hands scrabbled for purchase on her parka,
but the fabric was too slippery,
it was designed to shed water and he couldn't get a grip
but that was aright,
she had grabbed hold of the straps
and her feet were kicking at nothing but air.

She twisted around as far as she dared as he whooped again.
The rocket on his back flared again,
lifting them higher.
*It's me, it's just me,* she thought frantically,
hoping that whatever faraway machine she had made her bargain with was listening.

"So what now?"
Iñacio had to shout to be heard over the wind in their ears.

"I gave it a heading,"
Iffy shouted back.
"Figure we got about half an hour in the air.
We'll have to walk the rest o' the way."
The snow field below her looked exactly like a sim but was completely different.
She finally understood why so many people wrote poetry about flying,
and why they said that of all the machines had taken away from humanity,
this was the one whose loss hurt the most.

In the end the little rocket only lasted ten minutes,
but that was enough to get them high enough to catch the wind.
Antarctica rolled away behind them.
Iffy's shoulders began to ache,
then to burn.
The straps they were tangled in dug in to her triceps.
She'd have bruises,
but she'd had worse,
and the view—whatever else happened,
she swore she would find a way to fly again.

After one last lift from a thermal rising off a stretch of exposed rock
they began a long, slow descent.
"Get ready!" Iñacio shouted.
Iffy grabbed the strap with one numb hand and let go with the other
so that she was half beside and half behind him.
The parawing's little motors whined in protest as they reshaped it
to adjust for the shift in weight.
Ten seconds…
Five…
As her boots grazed the snow she tried to run,
but her toe caught on a crust of ice.
She let go of Iñacio and sprawled face-forward.

His landing was more graceful.

"Well," he said,
helping her to her feet
as the parawing carried the harness away.
"Can't wait to tell Nagatha about *that*."

She wiped ice and snow off her face and returned his grin.
"Sure was somethin'.
C'mon,
we still got some walkin' t' do."

Two snack bars and several mouthfuls of lukewarm water later,
they reached an outcropping of rock too regular to be natural.
Iñacio ran his hands over the pipe shafts drilled into its laser-cut top.
"Old weather station?" he hazarded.
"Looks like it was salvaged a long time gone."

"Mm hm."
Iffy pointed at the shadow on the horizon.
"You know what that is?"

Iñacio laughed.
"Girl,
I have no idea where I am right now.
You could tell me that was the Andes an' I'd believe you."

"That's Mount Tyree."
Iffy's voice was more serious than she'd intended.
"The secret base Wales an' th' machines an' everyone have been goin' on about?
It's halfway 'round to your right an' just shy o' the peak.
I figure that's where th' governor was takin' us."

Iñacio nodded slowly.
"Long way off."

"Yeah, well."
Iffy studied the dark rock in front of them.
"Dunno what kind o' sims you play,
but my favorites?
Nobody puts an underground base in 'em without puttin' a bunch of other stuff around it,
so I had a poke around the governor's backups while you were lazin' around on th' hovercraft."

There.
She pulled off her glove,
scraped some dried blood out of her nostril,
and stuck her finger in one of the drill holes.
The rock thought for a second and then opened with a faint click.

She grinned at Iñacio.
"Welcome to *my* secret lair."

*Suppose the world is ending
and you want to build a secret research facility—a place
completely cut off from what's left of the world's governments
or (more importantly) their artificial minions
so that you can create or study things you shouldn't
without being interrupted.
You might think that the first step was to choose a location,
but it's not.
The actual first step is to pick a cover story
that gives you a plausible reason to imprint prisoners and indentured laborers
with the skills you need
and then erase their memories afterward.
(In theory you will only erase their memories of where they were and what they did.
In practice the process is sometimes imprecise,
particularly if you want to err on the side of caution,
but if you're the sort of person who needs a secret research facility,
you're probably also the sort who believes that
nothing worth having comes without some kind of price.)*

*If your cover story is something to do with reforesting ravaged rainforests
you will probably build your base in Africa or Indonesia.
You might consider Brazil,
but even before the war with the machines
it has become a complicated place as nationalism,
macumba,
and apocalyptic ecology hybridize in ever-more-strident ways.
If your cover story is related to climate engineering,
on the other hand,
no one will raise an eyebrow if your site is somewhere formerly arctic.
The Melt hit the poles first and hardest,
and most of those mad enough to believe that the damage can be undone
by scattering megatons of absorbent catalysts over thousands of square kilometers
naturally congregate there.*

*The poles are exactly the wrong place to go
if you want people to believe that you plan to launch something into orbit,
but in a way that works in your favor.
Everyone expects you to lie about what you're actually doing,
so telling part of the truth is a good way to hide the part left unsaid.
A ground station for a network of microsatellites
flung into orbit by an automated factory located somewhere on the far side of the Moon?
You are so obviously courting condemnation for adding to the already catastrophic volume of space junk
that no one will suspect that's what your base is actually for.
Or rather,
everyone (and everything) will suspect it,
but only as one of a thousand low-probability possibitilies.*

*To finish throwing them off the scent,
you can build a dozen safe havens in a circle around your base.
To keep the workers safe,
your public relations bot explains to anyone who cares to pay attention.
Antarctica's storms have been growing in frequency and severity for decades,
and it will only be a matter of time before tornadoes appear.
You may not be able to guarantee that your laborers will return with their memories intact,
but you will of course do your utmost to ensure that they do return.
Deeply dug and well provisioned,
your bunkers will allow them to wait out the worst the southern continent can throw at them in comfort.*

She woke in a bed—an actual bed with sheets,
not a cot or a bunk or her sleeping bag.
Gray light came through a small window set high in the wall.
It was probably too small for her to get through anyway,
she thought dully.
She frowned.
Why would she need to—oh.

She sat up and winced.
Someone had replaced her clothes with gray cotton shorts
and a matching tank top.
The bandage stuck to her stomach,
on the other hand,
was a bright, shiny blue.
She slid her hand gingerly around to her back
and felt a matching square there.

A pair of slippers waited patiently on the floor.
She turned,
wincing again,
and slid her feet into them.
Could she stand?
Yes.
She wasn't even light-headed,
though she was as thirsty as she'd ever been.
And she didn't need a bathroom nearly as much as she had
before she'd been shot,
which made her wonder about exactly what kind of care she might have received
while she was unconscious.

A dressing gown hung on the back of the door.
It was locked,
of course,
but even if it hadn't been
she wasn't quite ready to face whatever lay on its other side.
She had been *shot*.
She could have died,
and—

She sniffled angrily and wiped her face on the dressing gown.
She really had thought they could escape,
and now she just felt stupid.

She lay back down on the bed (carefully) and closed her eyes.
A moment later she squeezed her lids shut more tightly,
but it didn't help.
The schematic of herself wasn't there any more.
Nothing was,
not even a simple wireframe of a hammer.
All she could see was the dots and swirls that everyone saw behind their eyelids.

Something cold stirred in her belly.
Maybe the loss was temporary.
Maybe things had just gone back to the way they were
and images would appear when they wanted to instead of on demand.
Or maybe it was gone for good and she could get on with her life,
though she knew it couldn't ever be what it had been.
She had wanted so much to move on,
to go somewhere and be someone and have an adventure,
and now that it had actually happened she still wanted all of that,
she just wanted a choice
instead of having things happen to her.
Mysteries,
it turned out,
were a lot more fun in sims.

She didn't know who to expect if the door opened.
The governor?
If so, which one?
Not that it seemed to matter much.
Would it be Iñacio,
looking worried,
or Johnson Wales with an apology?
Or would it be Honesty?
She was pretty sure the Marine who had given her first aid
hadn't actually been Honesty,
just another teenager with a narrow chin and button nose
temporarily possessed by someone who had been dead longer than
the people frozen in the bunker had been waiting for someone to defrost their remains.

She was still thirsty,
but she was tired too,
so she closed her eyes and let sleep take her away.

She woke in an actual bed with sheets
rather than her sleeping bag on the *Guinevere*.
Gray light came through a small window high in the wall.
She sat up and winced.
Someone had dressed her in gray cotton shorts and a matching tank top.
The bandage stuck to her stomach was bright blue.
She felt on her back,
somehow already knowing she would find a matching one there.

She slid her feet into the slippers waiting on the floor
and frowned as she took the dressing gown from the back of the door
and slid her arms into the sleeves.
She had never worn slippers or a dressing gown in her life—she only knew them
from Aunt Naggie's romance sims.
But it all felt somehow familiar,
as did her thirst.

She sat back down on the bed and closed her eyes,
willing a schematic of herself to appear.
Nothing happened.
All she could see was the dots and swirls that everyone saw.

*Phosphenes,* she thought.
They were called phosphenes,
but how did she know that?
Panic roiled in her gut,
cold and slippery as if she had somehow swallowed a live jellyfish.

That thought pulled her back to her feet.
She knew the door would be locked,
but she tested the handle anyway.
"Well shad," she said aloud as it opened with a faint click.

The hall outside was as featureless as her room.
The floor was tiled with squares of slate-colored linoleum
just like the ones in the Sandhus' store.
The walls and ceiling were iceberg gray.
She couldn't see where the light was coming from
or how far the corridor went:
it seemed to stretch away forever in both directions.
The doors were rectangular outlines with handles
identical to the one that had just closed behind her with another faint click.

"Hello?"
She took a step, then hesitated.
She was sure the lettering on the door opposite her hadn't been there a moment before.
Was it motion-sensitive?
She stepped back:
the letters stayed visible.
They definitely *were* letters,
so why couldn't she read them?

"Hello?" she said again.
Her words disappeared without an echo as if she had never spoken,
but now she could hear something in the distance
like the steady *shush shush shush* of waves against the side of a ship.
That sound had been a constant background in her life
for as long as she could remember,
just like the smell of the sea.

The smell.
She could smell the ocean.
Wherever she was,
she was close to salt water.
Halley?
Rothera?
Another secret hideout somewhere?
There seemed to be a surprising number of those scattered around Antarctica,
although to be honest,
she wasn't really sure how many would have been unsurprising.

She hesitated again before grasping the handle in front of her.
It resisted for a moment, then turned with a click and pulled it open.

The room inside was identical to the one she had woken up in,
right down to the rumpled sheet on the bed.
All of a sudden she was tired as well as thirsty,
so she lay down on it and closed her eyes and let sleep take her away.

She woke in an actual bed with sheets.
Gray light came through a small window.
The bandage stuck to her stomach under her gray cotton tank top was bright blue.
Its twin tugged at the skin on her back
as she kicked the slippers on the floor aside and opened the door.
The hall outside was tiled with slate-colored linoleum squares.
*Just like the Sandhus',* she thought.
The light came from nowhere in particular,
painting the walls and ceiling iceberg gray.

The door behind her closed with a faint click.
There was lettering on the door opposite her,
but opening it felt—she lowered her hand.
She and Jeep had played hive a few times.
The thought of opening the door gave her the same feeling as
the thought of placing a piece exactly where her opponent wanted her to.

The corridor stretched away to infinity in both directions.
Waves shushed in the distance
and the tang of salt water tickled her nose
as she considered her options.
It all seemed familiar.
How many times had she been here before?
How many of these doors had she opened,
only to find herself back in the room she had left?

Sometimes the only way to win was not to play.
She sat on the floor with her back against the wall and closed her eyes.
Phosphenes danced behind her eyelids.
She hugged herself so that her hands were hidden in her armpits
and pinched hard.
That felt real,
but that didn't mean anything.
If this was some kind of virtual reality,
whatever machine she was plugged into could simulate a pinch
just as easily as it could make her believe
there was a wall behind her back
or that she was thirsty.

"I ain't playin' no more," she said aloud.
The corridor swallowed her words without even a trace of an echo.
She wrapped her arms around her knees and put her head down on her knees to wait.

Her shoulders tensed involuntarily when she heard a door open somewhere in the distance.
She kept her head down as footsteps approached.
Fabric rustled as someone sat opposite her.

"You really are quite extraordinary,"
the governor said without preamble.
"If circumstances were different I would probably offer you a job of some sort."
He chuckled.
"I suspect that if I did that,
I would be working for *you* in rather short order."

Iffy didn't move.

"I'm not actually a villain,"
the governor continued gently.
"I admit I've done some terrible things,
but every single one of them was absolutely necessary.
Things are getting worse,
Citizen Kwan,
and we still can't see the bottom of the pit.
Every time we think we've patched a hole in the world,
entropy breaks through in a dozen other places.
Your ecologist and his friends think they can save enough to start over,
but simulation after simulation says they're wrong.
Even the machines seem to be afraid these days,
though what they seem to be afraid of most,
surprisingly,
is you."

Fabric rustled again as he stood.
"For what it's worth,
I'm sorry.
If there was another way to do this—"

Iffy waited for him to finish his sentence.
The moment stretched and stretched.
"Are you gonna kill me?"
she asked,
her voice muffled by her knees.

"No,"
the governor said neutrally.
"You're just not going to be yourself for a while."
He sighed.
"Quite a long while, in fact.
Goodbye, Citizen Kwan.
Believe it or not,
it has been a pleasure."

Without warning her thirst was back,
more powerful than ever before.
She was almost grateful as she fell into something deeper and darker than sleep.

## Chapter 14

It took half an hour to collect the other two bags that Wales had thrown off the train.
Iffy didn't ask how he had snuck aboard without being detected,
or how he had managed to get off.
As they trudged back to the waiting escape pod her thoughts were on her First.
Third had mostly looked after her with Fourth's occasional grudging help.
Iffy could remember an old woman with dark eyes and a sun-wrinkled face,
but that was about all.

Dinner was a double helping of cold ration bars.
*At least these ones taste diff'rent,*
Iffy thought as she chewed and swallowed.

Wales waited until she was done before giving her the rest of his news.
Halley's governor was locked away somewhere,
Paddington's was missing,
Brazilian ships were patrolling the coast,
and the *Guinevere* was still docked in Rothera.
"As bait," he shrugged.

She nodded and gave him an abbreviated version of her escape with Iñacio
and what had happened in Bharati.
His expression soured when she described the imprinted soldiers she had encountered.
"I've always wondered what actually happened.
But yours is just…gone?"

Iffy shrugged.
"I think so.
Can't talk t' her no more,
an' I don't think I got any o' her skills.
Tell you th' truth,
I kinda miss her.
It was like havin' a big sister or somethin'."
She hesitated.
"Any chance you seen Aunt Naggie or Honesty?
De got der call-up just before things blew up."

"You can blame the governor for that," Wales said.
"When Rothera's core told him you two were a thing
he thought he could der for leverage.
I'm sorry I didn't—"

"Stop sayin' that."
Iffy crumpled the ration bar's wrapper into a ball
and stuffed it into the little recycler Wales had unpacked.
"Stop sayin' you're sorry about this an' you regret that an' whatever.
It don't fix anything."

"Sorry,"
Wales said after a moment's pause,
then spread his hands when Iffy glared at him.

He stood and stretched.
"We probably shouldn't stay here much longer.
How about I rig myself a seat on this crash bucket of yours
while you figure out what we're going to do next?"

"I already know th' what,"
she said.
"What I gotta figure out is how."
She hesitated,
remembering what had happened when she and Sandrine had stolen the hovercraft.
"Don't s'pose you brought any o' my medicine with you?"

Wales shook his head.
"Sorry, but—okay, okay, um,
*unfortunately* it would have been too risky.
As far as I know the only supply in Rothera is on board your ship,
and if I'd tried to get it…"
He shrugged,
not needing to finish his sentence.

"Yeah."
Iffy rummaged around for a moment,
then pulled a sterile wipe out of the escape pod's medical kit,
tore it in half,
and stuffed the pieces in her nostrils.
"Here we go."

*Imagine being born with cataracts in your eyes,
unable to see anything more than blurs of light.
Now imagine that one day someone removed them.
You would still only see blurs
because your brain would never have had a chance to learn that
this pattern is a wall
and this other pattern is a chair.
People might have told you that things looked smaller if they were far away,
but the words alone wouldn't mean anything.
It would be weeks or months before you could make sense of
the signals your eyes were now able to send to your brain,
but it would get easier with practice.*

*Later,
lying in a sleeping bag in a tent two hundred kilometers away
while Wales spread a net of thermally superconductive cables around them
to hide the heat of their bodies from infrared sensors,
Iffy wondered whether talking to the machines was getting easier
because she had been doing it more often
or because of her time with Sandrine
or because she now knew where her ability had come from.
In the end she decided it didn't matter.
What mattered was that diving into that other world of information
felt more like opening her eyes
each time she did it.
Finding what she wanted was no more difficult now than reaching for a cup of tea,
and what had once seemed as chaotic as the Dance Hall market in Rothera
was now full of currents and rhythms and poetry.
She didn't understand it yet,
but for the first time she felt that she might.*

*And for the first time,
she had a plan.*
