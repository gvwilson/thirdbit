- The raccoons got to Antarctica the same way the polar bears did: human beings trying to build an ecosystem in a hurry. I'll make this clearer.

- I have no idea how Wales escapes in Chapter 8 except we've seen him go into icy water before (in Rothera harbor) and not be bothered. I originally planned for him to offer to take Iffy with him, but have her decline because (a) she wants to stay with Honesty and Naggie and (b) she doesn't really trust him. Does that work better?
  - Wales asks Iffy to go with him but she declines to stay with Honesty.

- I also have no idea how he gets into the secret lab at the end - bit of a rabbit out of a hat, that one.
  - FIXME: some warning that someone else is coming.

- The bargain in Chapter 9 is a reference back to Chapter 6. I need to make this clearer (and make it clearer what exactly the bargain *is*).

- Sandrine fades away: nope, that's just from Iffy (all the people who are imprinted are imprinted separately and react separately). It's a bit of a fudge having Honesty be all right by the time Iffy gets to Halley.
  - Handle this better: Honesty is still partly Sandrine but her injury is weakening the imprint more rapidly (hint at this earlier).

- I had another 1000 words of Iffy in the bunker, but it felt like padding. I don't have anything in particular that I need to have happen then - if you have suggestions, I'm open.
  - I was really just wondering, but it would be a good spot for a bit of reflection. So the readers can catch up, emotionally speaking. And so Iffy doesn't simply careen from crisis to crisis. This can be the part where she's putting together her thoughts about what she wants. She has seen the developing tundra, had interactions with both the animal/machine consciousness and the AI consciousness, and has interacted with a bunch of different human groups, each with its own agenda. This could be the place for Iffy to sort out for herself (and readers) what  she sees as the best way forward. Then there's less need to have her practice/think about her big speech at the end: we'll already know what she's going to say.

- Having Iffy practice her final speech: hm… I shall ponder.
