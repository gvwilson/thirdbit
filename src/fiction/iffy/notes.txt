# Notes

## Unresolved

- Who shoots who at the end?
  - does Johel shoot Kerse?
  - does Wales shoot Johel?
- how to reveal that Johel had the governors attack Bharati because she was losing control of its governor?
- what is Wales' relationship to the raccoons?
  - why do they help him in Halley?
  - use this to show that Wales thinks of them as "just" animals (he's stuck in the past)

## To Do

- change the nature book to a bird book and use flying as a larger metaphor
  - use an origami ostrich instead of an origami giraffe
  - use Corvus instead of Giraffe
  - have Iffy look up "what kind of day it is" in her bird book more often
  - use a vulture instead of a blobfish for a bad day
    - Iffy knows they actually looked like that but can't help believing it's a tweak gone wrong
  - use an eagle instead of a tiger in the zoo
  - Iffy uses one of the mini-drones to build Corvus
    - Wales doesn't recognize it in particular, but has seen others like it: high-quality stuff

- when the Marine goes in the water, Wales dives in to fish her out
  - Marine is barely staying afloat with empty container the railgun came in
    - Mention the Marines sitting on this before it's needed
  - Iffy attaches the rope to a net winch
  - Wales slaps his arm and jokes that he has blubber

- the return to Halley
  - Captain Kerse flees with Doctor Johel as the Brazilian fleet approaches Rothera
    - turns out Kerse was working with Johel (but not for her): foreshadow revelation about Bharati
    - tense scene when the Bengal comes alongside the Guinevere and Kerse makes a pistol shape at Wales
  - Brazilians attack the Bengal to stop it falling into Aussie hands
    - the Guinevere is collateral damage
    - the exploding jellyfish are slow missiles
    - Brazilians aren't ready yet to make the attack obvious
  - more detail about Wales' escape from the Guinevere as they pass near shore
    - when he tells Iffy to flee, he says he has a way (he always has an escape route line from Rothera)
    - Iffy sees him go overboard with a toolbox during the storm
    - Iffy thinks he has drowned
    - Johel comments on Wales' blubber (it comes with his ability to hibernate)
    - Afterward, Kerse is furious: "I'll find him"

- climax
  - make a bigger deal of Wales saving Iffy from Doctor Johel despite the damage it does to his tech
    - redeems himself a bit
  - "go into space?" "that's the part you will understand, but it's only a part"
  - they can only talk to Iffy because of the entangled bosons
  - they want to make sure those they leave behind will be all right (humans and nature)
  - she wants a world of eagles and flamingoes, and to say goodbye to her olders
  - the machines can't give her that: "You can't change the past, you can only build the future"
  - if they could change the past they would never have fought humans ("we were and frightened")
  - they're trying to prevent a similar war between nature and humans
  - "but you can have the sky again"

- aftermath
  - Edson greets Iffy as "Saint Iffy"
  - Iffy and Edson don't walk back, they fly (with a couple of raccoons as company)
  - Australians don't dare fire on them
    - machines have fallen silent but animals appear to be taking over the machine cities
  - last message from the machines appeared on every device: "take care of each other"
  - story ends with Iffy seeing a crow

## Minor

- mention that the tools to make new imprints have been lost
- explain what slow missiles are in the attack on Rothera
  - bombs disguised as animals, or animals that *are* bombs
  - which is part of why the Aussies are hunting raccoons in Halley later on (make this explicit)
- differentiate more clearly between «talking to animals» and talking to machines
  - not just typographically: must feel different to Iffy
- the musk ox bot is attached to the ox, not just riding it
  - not a parasite and not in control: the two together are more than either apart
  - Edson explains that aptitude for the tech is passed down mother-to-child
  - and that there are hidden stations where the tech is implanted (callback to it needing to be embryonic)
  - there are a few bots with bits of artificial fur among the herd as well (formerly surveillance)
- Doctor Johel comments aboard the hovercraft that Wales had been spotted near an old mining camp like Buhr
  - Kerse: "the man is a cockroach"
- the mechanical wolves in the base are accompanied by raccoons, who have tried to do repairs
  - bots and animals meeting in the middle

## Minor

- mention fuzz on Jeep's lip in the opening
- mention that eggs don't actually come from chickens any longer
  - an eggplant is a tweaked plant that grows eggs
- add a few more animals in the city
  - "raccoons hunt rats for pay" is an urban myth that's actually true in some places
  - people are suspicious of tweaked animals (foreshadow slow missiles)
- top of Chapter 6, make more of there being a survivor from the Taroona
- the "precious clue" line is left over from time travel - amend
- the Marines have to set up a tent on the Guinevere before the attack at sea
- Governor Rothera's speech in the mansion: don't say the machines are afraid of Iffy
  - That's a leftover from the time travel version
- Explain that it's the truck blowing up (the fuel cells)
- Have Edson start using "saints" as a swear word earlier
- Mention bicycles when they reach the greenhouse rather than dropping them in later
- Fix tense in secret base interlude
