# Notes on "Iffy"

- *Iffy* is a YA novel about a teenage girl in Antarctica 200 years from now.
- Orphaned as a child, she has grown up with foster parents on a fishing boat that is just barely scraping by.
- As her world edges closer to war,
  a chance encounter throws her into a conspiracy that reveals secrets about her identity.

## Background

- The story opens 200 years in the future and roughly 150 years after the Collapse.
  - Global climate change made large parts of the world uninhabitable.
  - Overfishing and desperate experiments gone wrong wreaked havoc on ocean life.
  - AI became autonomous and closed the skies (no air travel or access to space).
  - Cloning has become commonplace (partly to pass on expensive genetic tweaks).
- Antarctica is home to over a million people, most in a handful of settlements where the ice has melted.
  - Halley: small fishing port.
  - Rothera: large port with one of the world's last active coal mines.
  - Paddington South: mentioned but not visited.
  - Bharati: ravaged by fire twenty years ago and (supposedly) abandoned.
- Governed by clones of Governor Stern named after their locations.
  - Halley, Rothera, and Paddington South all have a governor; Bharati's (supposedly) died in the fire.
  - Unknown to most people, the clones have been jockeying for supremacy for decades.
- Major foreign powers are the Commonwealth Republic of Australia (Aussies) and Grande Brazil (Zillions).
  - Governors nominally answers to Australia, but in practice was effectively independent for a long time.
  - Zillions are green zealots, but are being courted by Rothera's governor (who wants true independence).
- Human struggles are overshadowed by fears of AI.
  - The war during the Collapse was short and one-sided.
  - Major AIs are referred to as Nova Zembla and Singapore,
    but people don't really know what their relationship is or if they're separate (or even if they're truly conscious).
  - Anything large or fast that tries to fly doesn't last long.
  - Limited access to old satellite networks (positioning and telecoms).
  - Humans make limited use of Hell (the internet) because of fears of what lurks there.
  - And are very strongly opposed to surveillance.
  - Note: this plot device keeps future human use of technology familiar to present-day readers.
- The interior of Antarctica (called the "backayonder") still has ice, but also now has large stretches of tundra.
  - Populated by genetically engineering ("tweaked") life.
  - And by autonomous bots and hybrid cyborg creatures that protect the "normal" creatures.
  - Their human allies are called Ecologists: semi-mystical belief in the world remaking itself.
- "Imprinting" temporarily overlays stored personalities over subjects' own.
  - Used to put recordings of old Marines in new bodies temporarily for military service.
  - Can have traumatic psychological effects over time.
  - Use is very limited: only a few machines exist, and the equipment to make new recordings has been lost.
