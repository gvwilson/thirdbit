- The raccoons got to Antarctica the same way the polar bears did: human beings trying to build an ecosystem in a hurry. I'll make this clearer.

- I have no idea how Wales escapes in Chapter 8 except we've seen him go into icy water before (in Rothera harbor) and not be bothered. I originally planned for him to offer to take Iffy with him, but have her decline because (a) she wants to stay with Honesty and Naggie and (b) she doesn't really trust him. Does that work better?

- I also have no idea how he gets into the secret lab at the end - bit of a rabbit out of a hat, that one.

- The bargain in Chapter 9 is a reference back to Chapter 6. I need to make this clearer (and make it clearer what exactly the bargain *is*).

- Sandrine fades away: nope, that's just from Iffy (all the people who are imprinted are imprinted separately and react separately). It's a bit of a fudge having Honesty be all right by the time Iffy gets to Halley - I need to think about how to handle that better.

- I had another 1000 words of Iffy in the bunker, but it felt like padding. I don't have anything in particular that I need to have happen then - if you have suggestions, I'm open.

- Having Iffy practice her final speech: hm… I shall ponder.
