As we'll discover soon, most of Antarctica is still covered in ice (there's even still icecap on Greenland), so the water level has "only" risen about 10m so far, but things are still getting worse.

Regarding machines and government, that should become clearer in a couple of chapters. And yeah, the Internet basically collapsed into a mess of mis-truth and disinformation - I think we're already seeing that. As for cloning, I think that some people who have had genetic modifications (either to eliminate disease or enhancements of some kind) may see benefits in reproducing via parthenogenesis in order to preserve those changes. I'll highlight this when we meet another of the governors (who are some of the very few male clones in existence).

Imprinting: I'm going to have a few things to say about attempts to industrialize education going very, very wrong. Only a few machines are left, and only a handful of templates - nobody has the tech to make more (and of course it was the military that tried using it first).

As for Iffy, Wales, and what's _really_ in that old base: that would be telling... :-)

Glad you're enjoying it,

> So, on the one hand, we have climate change that won't stop and a flooded planet with fewer places for people to live.  Some cities still exist, and some countries (I guess parts of them. For example, for sure the whole humid pampa of Argentina disappeared; it is only 200m above sea level).  I have no idea how that government/state and politics work.  You mention governors of what looks like cities in Antarctica, but also a kind of central government, which seems to be in Australia? .  And some of them are clones. Why? Do people still choose? Or is it a mix of civic-military government?

> Then we also have that machines eventually became conscious and started a war against humans.  But even though they were winning at one point, they stopped, and we don't know why. At the same time, some machines work with (or for) humans, and some others fight with the Zillions, so it looks like some machines still want the war (or the Zillions are doing this alone).  So I wonder if that central core/government is actually human or if the machines are watching us (but just as a matter of curiosity or to check if we are still dangerous for the planet or taking care of us, despite all the horrible things we did to the planet and to ourselves.).

> Something happens with the internet. It seems that there was a lot of junk information, and there were people who did crazy things to be able to connect. There is still some digital communication. Iffy has something like Signal, and there are also video games. The boats, and other stuff with computers (cores) with some AI in them.  But also people?  The trans?  Or people with implants/accessories.

> There were genetic advances, and suddenly, you could make clones and modify people's abilities. But I don't know if this was after the war and because of it or before.  I can imagine millionaires who wanted to be immortal, genetically modifying themselves to last forever, and when they saw that they could not, they cloned themselves.  It could also be that this was done to have stronger and more efficient soldiers (the modifying) or to have soldiers (the clones, because there are very few people in the world).  I wonder if some unmodified people or people are not clones or do not have clones.

> You can also take the consciousness (?) of a dead person and imprint it on another person (I can also imagine people who want to live forever and then mix this technology with their clones). Already, it is used to turn every person over 16 years old into a potential soldier.  Isn't it done with other skills, like medicine or engineering?

> Besides being a clone, Iffy has special abilities, like building very complex machines, because she can calculate many possibilities. Still, her brain looks like a human, and every time she forces it using it to build something so complex, she suffers the consequences with some convulsions.   I wonder if the clones are made from the last clone and if all the experiences lived in the previous existences are passed to the new one (and that is why Iffy remembers things that she never learned or saw), or perhaps she was also inducted.

> Wales is a mystery; what does he want to do?  He want to change everything, but how? Until now, I guess that he has to repair or build (or dismantle) some very complex machinery, and that is why he needs and is so interested in Iffy. But she can be really harmed if she does it, right? But perhaps Wales will promise her a future where people don’t have to be inducted and change (like Jeep and possibly Honesty), and because of that, she will fix/build/dismantle the thing anyway because she has the courage and is a good person.

> And the doctor and the governor, they want things to change? Most of the time, people in power don’t want things to change, so why are they working with Wales?  Perhaps they know about this machinery and wnat more power?
