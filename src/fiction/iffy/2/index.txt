## Chapter 1

Iffy had a bad dream that night.
It was the same one she always had,
and the worst part was that it wasn't really a dream.

She was on deck.
The Antarctic sky was a blue bowl overhead,
summer cold instead of winter freezing.
Second and Third were stuffing her into
a hand-me-down ecosuit that had cost as much as one of their jelly dredging nets.
"Just t' be safe, love," Third said,
forcing a smile but unable to keep the fear out of her voice.
She kissed the family's youngest clone on the forehead
and slipped Iffy's favorite bedtime book inside the bulky orange suit.
"Just in case."

The ship's horn blared another warning.
Iffy started to cry.
Her olders had pulled her out of bed just a few moments before,
and she was only half awake.

Third hugged her again.
"Enough o' that!" Second snapped.
At the time Iffy thought the older clone was angry at her for something she had done.
Years later she realized Second had been angry at the sea for what was about to happen
and at herself for not being able to stop it.

"She's boilin'!" Fourth shouted from the crow's nest.
"Two hundred meters ahead an' ten points off starboard!"

Third sealed the last flap on the ecosuit.
"I love you," she said in Iffy's ear.
"I love you always an' forever."

"I love you too," Iffy replied tearfully.
She tried to return Third's hug,
but the thick insulation in the suit made it hard to bend her arms.

Second bent over and kissed them both on the tops of their heads.
She smelled like engine oil and the soap she always used when she shaved her head.
That was what Iffy remembered afterwards—that,
and the stench of methane rising out of the sea around them.
Hundreds of meters below,
a million tiny bubbles trapped in ancient clathrate ice were about to burst free.

The deck pitched sideways as First tried desperately
to steer the *Rushin Doll* out of the mass of foam boiling up around them.
"She's boilin'! She's boilin'!" Fourth shouted.
The ship's horn blared one last time.
Third closed the ecosuit's faceplate and mouthed "I love you" one last time.

The ship staggered and dropped two meters.
Iffy screamed as she tumbled onto the deck.
Second and Third landed in a tangle beside beside her.
Ice-cold sea water crashed down on top of them.
Iffy screamed again as the slosh dragged her and her olders against the taffrail.
Her olders grabbed for it,
but the ship dropped again
as the gas rising from the ocean floor
churned the water into a froth too thin to hold the boat afloat.
The last thing Iffy saw before the water closed over her
was Fourth falling from the crow's nest,
her arms and legs flailing against the perfect blue sky.

The ecosuit was a hundred years old,
but its seals held.
It kept her warm while the thumb-sized motors in its arms and legs
steered her clear of the after-bubbles that would have swallowed a lifeboat.

Her dream stopped then,
just like always.
She didn't remember the sea snapping the *Rushin Doll*'s keel.
She didn't remember being hauled out of the sea in a jelly dredging net hours later,
or standing on the deck of the *Guinevere* for the first time.
But she remembered how blue the sky was,
and how it had felt to be alone for the first time in her life.

The woman she came to call Aunt Naggie said it was a miracle Iffy had survived.
It was even more of a miracle that she wound up staying on the *Guinevere*.
Her captain,
Uncle Jack,
didn't like children.
Or animals.
Or foreigners or the governor
or the co-ops that bought the jellyfish he and Aunt Naggie dredged out of the Weddell Sea
or passers-by who looked at him the wrong way
or didn't have the decency to look at him at all.
He would have dropped her on the pier and sailed away.
The docksiders in Rothera never understood why he didn't.
They wouldn't have believe that
his long-suffering wife had put her hands on her hips
and told him that the child was staying or she was leaving,
which was it going to be?

So Iffy stayed, but not the ecosuit.
Uncle Jack had two pairs that night,
eights over fives,
but the Aussie across the table had three sixes.
"You were gonna outgrow it anyway,"
he snapped over her tearful protests when she found out it was gone.
"Gotta pay for your keep somehow."

He would have gambled away the book tucked into the suit as well
if Aunt Naggie hadn't misplaced it until he forgot about it.
It had belonged to Third when she was Iffy's age,
and to Second before that,
and came from a time when people made books out of paper
and there were still whales and tigers and giraffes.
Iffy re-read it every night no matter how tired she was from chores.
She drew the pictures from memory on her app when she was bored by school,
and on those rare occasions when another child came on board to play with her,
she took out the book and told them all about *orcinus orca* and *panthera tigris*
and her favorite, *giraffa camelopardalis*.

"They were too real!" she said fiercely whenever anyone expressed any doubts.
"Real as gulls and jellies!"
Real as the handwritten comments in the book's margins that she spent hours deciphering.
Real as being poor and lonely
as she grew older
and Uncle Jack's business deals left them with a little less each season.

Iffy woke that morning to the sound of Aunt Naggie bustling about in the galley.
She lay on the narrow foam packing slab she used as a mattress for one final precious moment
before slithering out of her salvaged sleeping bag
and pulling a layer of clothes over her thermals.
The noise was her foster mother's way of telling her that Uncle Jack was awake
and that she should be up on deck doing something useful
before he stumbled out into the light looking for someone to yell at.

She closed her eyes and opened her nature book at random.
It was ridiculous—Jeep had made fun of her for a month
when he found out—but…

"Figures," she muttered when she opened her eyes.
The armadillo wasn't the most ridiculous animal in the book,
but it wasn't her favorite.
Still,
an armadillo day was better than a blobfish day.
She tucked the book back under her mattress,
yawned,
rubbed the stubble on her scalp,
and undogged the door of the storage locker
that had been her bedroom for the past eight years.

Stepping onto the deck of the *Guinevere* was like being born:
everything was suddenly bright and cold and loud and smelly and amazing.
She stopped for a moment to let her eyes adjust to the light.
To seaward lay the broken hulk of a carrier
that had driven itself aground a century before
to create a seawall for the town's harbor.
Dozens of ships, large and small, bobbed up and down in its lee.
Some were as old as the carrier,
patched and re-patched over the years like the *Guinevere* to stay seaworthy.
Others were newer:
broad-beamed cargo haulers flying the Aussie stars
or sleek Zillion-built clippers with bright kite sails furled around triple masts.
Gulls wheeled overhead in their endless search for scraps,
complaining to one another about that nobody threw away anything worth eating any more.

The town watched the harbor like a grumpy old man watching children at play.
Once upon a time,
Halley had been a research station where scientists studied the early signs of the Melt.
As the ice disappeared and life back home became desperate
they converted their labs into temporary houses.
By the time their children were grown they had stopped doing research
or calling the houses "temporary".

Two thousand people now made Halley their home under the governors' watchful eyes.
During the summer blooms they dredged jellyfish out of the sea
to render down for fuel and fertilizer.
When winter came they tended the town's precious greenhouses
or sailed north to Patagonia or Tasmania
to find work that would get them through the long dark.

Iffy shaded her eyes against the razor-edged sun.
A cluster of buildings was taking shape by the new pier on the edge of town.
Two were just bunkhouses,
but the third—the one Iffy had watched go up like a hungry gull waiting for scraps—was a machine shop.
Shiploads of precious equipment had already been carted through its double-wide doors:
forges, presses,
a lathe with a spindle thicker than Iffy's leg,
and the prize of them all,
a printer from Nova Zembla at the opposite end of the earth.

It had arrived in the hold of a heavily-armed Aussie destroyer.
The whole town had turned out when the warship came into harbor,
railguns bristling and drones darting back and forth above her.
They lined the streets and cheered
as the destroyer's crew and a squad of Marines escorted the boxy machine through Halley's streets
to the town's quarantine shed.
Once Halley's core finished its months-long check for malware,
the only limit to what the printer could make
would be the plans and raw materials people could give it.

Iffy had seen some of those plans glowing softly on apps in Halley's three cafés.
She had taken surreptitious notes on her app instead of doing homework
while mechanics and engineers and core techs argued about weights and tolerances and expansion coefficients,
then spent hours looking up words she didn't know and figuring out how they fit together.

She wanted to be part of those conversations so much it ached.
But even more than that,
she wanted to know why things she *hadn't* seen kept popping into her head.
Ghostly shapes flickered behind her eyes if she thought too hard about the plans:
fractal capacitors,
resonant heat sinks,
and ever-so-slightly irregular gears
whose off-center spin would automatically synchronize to minimize power coupling.
She had gone as deep into Hell as she dared to find answers,
but every trail ended in "no results" or a blinking scarlet "restricted" warning.
After a while she had stopped looking,
afraid of who or what might notice.

"Girl! Girl! Dammit, woman, where is that affin' girl?"
Iffy jumped as Uncle Jack bellowed from below deck.
He had been out with his biffs the night before,
which was Uncle Jack-speak for drinking more than he could handle
and gambling more than they could afford.
Aunt Naggie somehow managed to winkle enough out of his app while he was snoring to keep the *Guinevere* afloat,
but it had been weeks since they'd had fruit,
and she couldn't remember the last time there had even been mention of new clothes
or of replacing their frayed nets.

"Girl!" Uncle Jack shouted again.
"Get your affin' tail down here *now* or saints help me you'll be scrapin' barnacles for a *week*!"
His hand made a meaty *thud!* as he slapped the bulkhead for emphasis.

With one last longing look at the machine shop,
Iffy lifted the hatch beside her.
"I'm right here, Uncle Jack," she said. "I was just—"

"You were just lyin' about like some fairytale princess an' don't try to tell me otherways!"
The *Guinevere*'s captain glared up at her,
squinting as the bright sky framing her head assaulted his hungover eyes.
There was a bruise on his forehead that hadn't been there at dinner,
Iffy noticed.
That might mean a visit from the Marines later.
He'd scowl and mutter and make excuses to them,
then bluster to Aunt Naggie after they were gone
about how the governors were just meat puppets
and that the town's cores were going to sell them out to the Zillions
as soon as they could get a decent price.

"Your eggs'll be ready in a mo," Aunt Naggie cut in hurriedly
as Uncle Jack opened his mouth to unleash another bellow.
"Do you want a bit o' curry on them?
I think I have—no, wait, not there…"
She rummaged nervously among the precious little jars
that sat on the shelf beside the galley's two-loop stove.

"Affin' right I want a bit o' curry," Uncle Jack grumbled,
settling into a fold-up chair that squeaked under his weight.

Iffy's stomach grumbled as the smell of eggs, turmeric, and cumin teased her nostrils.
Tilting her frying pan,
Aunt Naggie slid two perfectly fried eggs into Uncle Jack's bowl.
Without so much as a grunt of thanks
her husband took the entire basket of naan from the center of table in one hand
and his plate with the other
and disappeared back into his cabin.
As the door closed
Iffy heard something gurgle out of a bottle.

Aunt Naggie let out the breath she'd been holding
and smiled at her foster daughter.
"You'll be hungry then?"

"Not really," Iffy lied.

"Course not. Here."
She slipped a hard-boiled egg out of the pocket of her apron and handed it to Iffy.
"An' here, this too."
A piece of perfectly-browned naan,
so fresh it was slightly sticky,
appeared out of another pocket.

"Thanks auntie," Iffy said gratefully.
"You eat already?"

"Course, first thing," Aunt Naggie lied in turn.
She leaned over and kissed the stubble on top of Iffy's head.
"You best get that in you quick an' start work on the winch cable.
An' he says th' engine's got a knock in it again—best have a look at that too
before it starts to bother him."

"It's the reciprocating rod," Iffy said around a mouthful of naan.
"Mister Mishra will straighten it out if I take it in before he gets busy.
It won't cost nothin',"
she added hastily before her foster mother could object.
"Not if I do a couple o' little jobs for him.
I could head over right now if you wanted."

"If *I* wanted?"
Aunt Naggie teased.
"Well,
if you're goin' that way,
stop in at Sandhu's an' see what they want for more eggs.
Those were our last ones.
I'll tell Jack you're off doin' chores once he's…"
She finished her sentence with an apologetic shrug.

"Thanks auntie," Iffy said gratefully.
She climbed the ladder and hurried aft as quietly as she could.

The ship's toolbox rattled as she dragged it out from under the bench at the *Guinevere*'s stern.
Its cast-offs and hand-me-downs only included things so essential that even Uncle Jack wouldn't sell them.
After a furtive glance over her shoulder,
she reached up under the bench and unclipped the canvas bag that held *her* tools,
the ones she had salvaged and mended
or had been given in return for doing odd jobs for people around the harbor.
She pushed the toolbox back into place and tucked her toolbag under her coat.

It only took her a few moments to disengage the bent rod from the engine and tuck it into a pocket.
She closed the engine casing as gently as she could and hurried down the gangplank,
the weight of life on the *Guinevere* lifting from her shoulders
as her boots hit the pier.

The Antarctic summer didn't have days or nights,
but ships and people kept to clock time as best they could.
An old couple had woken early
to scrape tweaked barnacles off long strips of plastic they had hung from the pier months before.
Hundreds of little shells glittered with tiny particles of metal they had filtered out of the water.
Ground down and incinerated,
they would yield a few grams of copper or manganese
that could keep some old piece of tech limping along for another season.

One of the women straightened and raised a hand in greeting as Iffy went by.
"Beautiful day," she said. "You headin' t' town?"

"Am that," Iffy nodded,
not wanting to slow down for conversation.

The old woman nodded back.
"You be careful, aye?
The *Taroona* came in yesterday.
Those pirates been bustin' up ever since."

"Thanks," Iffy said dutifully.
The old woman smiled and bent back to her strips and buckets.

The teens at the head of the pier arguing over how best to hang a net for mending
glanced at her as she went by but didn't say anything.
Iffy didn't expect them to.
*At least they don't cross their fingers and spit,* she thought.
Sailors were superstitious, and she was a sole survivor.
Nobody looked at her sidelong
the way they had when the loss of the *Rushin Doll* was still fresh,
but despite Aunt Naggie's efforts,
Iffy had found that friends were something that mostly happened to other people.

*Mishra & Co Fine Technical Work - No Job Too Small!*
occupied a long shed that might actually have been the oldest building in Halley.
The sliding door that took up half its front wall hadn't opened since before she was born,
so she banged on the smaller door cut into it.

It scraped open on her third knock.
"Hey Jeep,"
she said to the boy scowling at her from inside.
"Is your da here?"
She held up the bent reciprocating rod by way of explanation.

"Along back," Jeep muttered,
jerking his thumb over his shoulder and making just enough room for Iffy to squeeze past him.

The inside of the shed was a humid mug of long-ago fish,
freshly singed metal,
and the not-entirely-legal compost bricks Mister Mishra burned in the furnace
to keep his equipment from freezing in the winter.
Mismatched lights hung from the ceiling.
The shadows they cast made the compact machines
and shelves of carefully sorted scrap on the shop floor
look like battlebots from old war sims.
They had frightened Iffy the first time she ventured among them,
but all she saw now was what they could make—what *she* could make with them.

Mister Mishra was sharpening his fingers on a grinding wheel in the center of the shop.
He nodded at Iffy but didn't speak until the last sparks had flown off his steel nails
and the wheel spun down to a halt.
Pushing his safety goggles up onto his forehead,
he tugged the calloused fingers of his real hand through the tangles in his beard.
"Buy, sell, or trade?" he asked.

"Trade," Iffy said.
She held up the bent reciprocating rod.
"Tangled some flotsam comin' in from our last dredge.
The engine over-spun before I could get to it.
There's no cracks or nothin'," she added hastily,
handing the piece to him.
"Just needs t' be re-angled an' annealed."

"Hm."
The wiry machinist turned the rod over,
sighted along its length,
then held it up to his good ear and tapped it with his metal fingers.
Iffy had seen him go through this ritual more times than she could count,
but still didn't know if the he was bluffing
or if he really could hear flaws too small for eyes to see.

He handed the rod back to her.
"She'll be right enough once she's straightened," he pronounced.
"But it'll cost you."

The tension eased out of Iffy's shoulders.
Mister Mishra didn't bargain unless he'd already decided that he was going to say yes.
After that it was just a matter of price.

In the end,
getting the rod bent straight cost her half an hour of sorting scraps for smelting.
It wasn't the machine work she'd hoped for,
but she had learned that if she timed her questions right
he would take a minute here and there to show her
how to dog the belaying plate on the laser drill
or line up a set of gatling hammers to rat-a-tat-tat a piece of sheet metal into a graceful springy curve.
She was careful never to stare at the burn scar where his left ear should have been
or at the fractal spider's web of articulated metal that had replaced his left forearm.
She was equally careful not to look up when his son Jeep slouched in
to say that lunch was ready but *amma* said he had to clean up first.

"You hungry?" Mister Mishra asked
as he spun the handwheel on the drill to lift the laser into its locking position.

"No thanks—I brought," Iffy said,
holding up the egg Aunt Naggie had given her.

"Hm." Mister Mishra ran his fingers through his beard again.
"Not much to grow on."

"It'll do me fine,"
Iffy said.
She nodded toward the laser drill as casually as she could.
"You mind I try a couple of pieces while you're out?"

Mister Mishra shook his head.
"Nuh uh, girl.
Nobody touches my darlin' without I'm here to watch.
You break that,
I'll have t' send up t' Amundsen for parts,
and odds are they have t' send all the way up to Taz."

"Aright," Iffy said,
feigning disappointment even though she'd known what the answer would be.
"How about I use th' mechanical one instead?
Just for learnin'," she added hastily.
"It's not paid work or nothin'.
I'll just drill some scrap—you can count it all in an' out t' make sure."

Mister Mishra chuckled.
"No worry about th' scrap, girl.
An' no worry about gettin' paid.
If you found work hereabouts that I haven't, more power to you."
He rolled his head to loosen the kinks in his neck
and waggled the digits of his artificial hand.
"Mind your eyes an' fingers, aye?"

"Aye," Iffy agreed eagerly.
She had her scavenged safety goggles on her face and the drill bit engaged
before Mister Mishra reached the door.

Drilling holes wasn't hard—she'd mastered that long ago.
The hard part was drilling them in the right place.
After examining and discarding half a dozen pieces of scrap,
she found one that was bent enough to be a challenge.

The first hole only took a minute.
It then took her another fifteen minutes to measure,
mark,
measure again,
swear under her breath,
find a pair of calipers in the chaos on top of Mister Mishra's toolbench,
chock the piece,
measure a third time,
and re-align everything juuuuust a little.
A bot could have done the whole job in a couple of seconds,
but bots had malware—at least,
the kinds of bots that people in Halley could afford.
"You want it fast, use a bot," Mister Mishra always said.
"You want it *right*, do it yourself."

Slowly, steadily, Iffy brought the spinning drillbit down
until it just barely kissed the metal and—

"What are you doin'?"
She jumped and spun around.
Jeep was leaning against a set of shelves,
arms crossed and scowl firmly in place.

"What're you doin' sneakin' up on me like that?" she demanded.
"Aren't you supposed t' be havin' lunch or something?"

His scowl deepened.
"Finished. Does my da know what you're about?"

"Course he does."
Iffy scratched a sudden itch on her nose,
then pulled her hand back down to her side.
Mister Mishra *did* know, and she had nothing to be embarrassed about.

"Uh huh. What about your uncle?" Jeep asked,
looking everywhere but straight at her.
"He still bein' trash on you?"

Iffy shrugged.
"Comes an' goes."
She and Jeep had talked a few times
when she first started coming by.
He had shown her a few of his sims
and she had shared a few stories about life at sea.
For a while she had thought he was working up the courage
to do something more than just talk,
but…

The silence stretched uncomfortably.
"I gotta get back t' this," she finally said,
waving a hand at the drill press idling behind her.

Jeep straightened up.
"Wouldn't you rather be doin' somethin useful?"

"This *is* useful!" Iffy said hotly.
"And it's none o' your business what I do or don't."
She turned back to the drill,
placing her foot firmly on the pedal that controlled the motor's speed.

"Just be careful," Jeep said belligerently.
"Da's double worried about that new printer takin' work away.
If anythin' here gets bust up—"

"Anythin' here gets bust up your da will know it was me that did it
because it ain't like *you* ever put your hands to any o' this!"
Iffy snapped.
She cranked the drill bit up into its locked position and switched the machine off.
"Here!"
Three quick twists undid the chocks that held her test piece in place.
She tossed it at him harder than the distance required,
then took the calipers from the work tray on the side of the drill
and slapped them back onto the bench.
"Gimme a sec an' I'll sweep up th' shavings for you to weigh
so you can be sure I ain't fillin' my pockets or nothin'."

Without waiting for answer she pulled the goggles down around her neck
and grabbed the old broom that stood next to a broken sonic press like a forgotten sentry.
Jeep watched her sweep,
anger and something that might have been embarrassment written on his face.
"You missed a bit," he finally said,
jerking his chin at a random patch of floor before turning and stalking away.
The door banged behind him.

Iffy emptied the dustpan into the trash and tossed her goggles into her toolbag.
It wasn't fair—Jeep could use the equipment any time he wanted,
but all he ever did was complain and look for ways not to.

The worst thing was,
she knew it wasn't Jeep's fault he was like this.
Like everyone else in Antarctica
he had been inducted into the Marines when he turned sixteen.
He'd only served a quarter—just long enough to be sure that the imprinting had worked—but
having someone else's personality temporarily pushed down on top of his own had changed him.
"He'll come back eventually,"
Mister Mishra said the one time Iffy broached the subject,
his tone making it clear that she shouldn't bring it up again.
"It just takes some folk longer than others to find their way home."

The sky was the same relentless blue it had been an hour earlier when Iffy stepped outside,
the mended reciprocating rod tucked inside her coat.
She peeled her egg as she walked toward the grocery store,
trying not to get grease on the rubbery white flesh and the warm yellow-brown yolk.
A couple of Aunt Naggie's friends smiled or waved as she went by.
She nodded back,
ignoring the others who tsk'ed to each other
at the sight of a scruffy little jelly dredger
in a stained coat two sizes too big for her.

A commotion down a side street caught her ear.
Someone was singing off-key.
Another voice joined in, then a third, and then glass broke on stone.
"Bloody pirates," a passer-by muttered to his companion.
"Governors shoulda sunk the *Taroona*, not let her berth."
The second man grunted acknowledgment.
Iffy kept her eyes on the cobblestones and picked up her pace.

Sandhu's grocery store was out of eggs.
They had onions,
though,
and a box of dried green peppers that had come in from somewhere carefully unspecified.
Little Mrs. Sandhu wrapped half a dozen slices in wax paper.
"For your beautiful aunt," she said over Iffy's protests,
just as she did every time she gave her something extra.
"An' here,
a little of our special curry mix.
I know how much you like it."
She handed Iffy a small plastic jar of orange-brown powder.

Big Mrs. Sandhu snorted just as *she* always did.
"You should take Nagatha your presents yourself," she scolded.

Her wife smiled.
"*La,* but where would be th' romance in that?"

Big Mrs. Sandhu snorted again.
Whatever Little Mrs. Sandhu might have said next
was cut short by a jingle from the bell on the store's front door.
Three heads turned at a cheerful, "Good morning!"
as the squarest man Iffy had ever seen walked in.

"Square" really was the only word for him.
He wasn't much taller than Iffy,
but three of her could have stood side by side in the span of his shoulders.
Strong white teeth gleamed against his black skin when he smiled,
and the flickering silver rectangles in his temples
made him look like he had stepped out of an adventure sim.

"Good mornin, *sri*," Big Mrs. Sandhu said, bowing her head slightly.
"Is there something we could help you with?"

"Just some advice, ma'am, if you've any of that for sale?"
His twanging accent sounded American to Iffy,
though the only Americans she had ever heard had been market preachers
or villains in sims.

"Advice is always free here," Little Mrs. Sandhu simpered,
wiping her hands on her apron.
Big Mrs. Sandhu looked sidelong at Iffy and rolled her eyes.
Iffy bit back a laugh—Little Mrs. Sandhu's flirting was as famous in Halley
as her smuggled vegetables.

"Thank you kindly," the square man said.
"I'm just in from South Georgia,
and find myself in need of a place to stay for a few days.
I don't suppose you could recommend somewhere that isn't too expensive?"
He spread his hands apologetically.
"It seems that my luggage went missing in transit."

"Oh you poor *cho*," Little Mrs. Sandhu clucked sympathetically.

Big Mrs. Sandhu shook her head.
"That'd be the *Taroona* you come in on?"
When the newcomer nodded she shook her head again.
"They're *bura badi*,
that crew,
pirates and leggers and worse.
You're lucky if all they nickered was your bags an' not your kidneys."

The square man sighed.
"That may be, but I confess that I don't feel particularly lucky.
I was hoping to set myself up in business, but without my tools…"
He shrugged.

"What kind o' tools?" Iffy asked.
She had been about to slip away—her uncle would be looking for her soon,
and she didn't want to leave Aunt Naggie to deal with his ire on her own—but
tools were worth a few extra seconds.

The square man grimaced.
"A couple of half-mil waldoes,
a sintering laser,
a fractal de-ionizer for cleaning chaff off old cores,
a set of diffraction lenses,
and—"

"There's no such thing as a fractal de-ionizer,"
Iffy cut in scornfully.

The square man blinked.
"Sure there is.
You take the ionizer out of a differential micromagnetic filter,
stick it in a high-conductance fractal mesh,
and boom—there's your de-ionizer."

"Huh.
Feedback would slag that th' second you turned it on,"
Iffy scoffed.

"If you're careless, sure," the square man agreed.
"You have to recalibrate the impedance every once in a while so that it doesn't overheat.
But if you have a micropore evaporator—"

"—you can use liquid nitrogen to quench the thermal,"
Iffy finished,
the solution suddenly clear in her head.

"Exactly."
The newcomer cocked his head,
looking at Iffy as if she was some strange machine brought in for repair.

"Well, if you two are done comparin' notes,
there's a couple o' places I can point you at,"
Big Mrs. Sandhu cut in briskly.
"Can't promise they'll be cheap,
but they're clean,
an' you won't wake up in the middle o' the night with any o' your parts gone."

"Thank you," the square man said absently, still studying Iffy.
"And if you don't mind me asking another question,
where did your daughter learn so much about tech?
There are people with a lot of years behind them
who wouldn't have thought about the resonance feedback."

"Oh, Iffy's not ours,"
Little Mrs. Sandhu said lightly.
"She's crew off the *Guinevere*."

"I see."
The square man nodded as if that explained everything
and stuck out his hand.
"Johnson Wales," he said.
"Pleased to meet you."

Iffy hesitated,
then took his hand and shook it.
"Fifth Ang Kwan, but everyone calls me Iffy.
Pleased to meet you too."

## Chapter 2

Iffy ran all the way back to the pier,
dodging around the people and occasional bots going about their chores
in Halley's narrow cobblestone streets.
"*Gardez-vous!* *Gardez-vous!*"
scolded the centipede-shaped fixit bot everyone called French Henry.
She squeezed between its rust-streaked frame
and a rack of insulating moss someone had set out to dry in the sun
and kept running.

The barnacle farmers were still bent over their work when she reached the pier.
She stopped and put her hands on her knees to catch her breath.
"How's yer haul?" she panted.

"Not bad," one of them said.
She nudged a scratched blue bucket with her boot.
"Prob'ly get thirty grams outta this when it renders down.
That'll buy a nice dinner."
Her smile showed more gaps than teeth.

"Good luck," Iffy said.
She straightened up and walked quickly the rest of the way to the *Guinevere*,
her lips moving as she practiced what she was going to say.

Metal clanged on metal as she reached the ship.
"Affin'… shaddin'… dammit!" Uncle Jack swore,
a wrench in one hand and a screw cuff in the other.
Iffy's heart sank.
He was trying to mend the backstay cable that had snapped a few days ago.
It was a fiddly job at the best of times,
and if he had a hangover…

The scowl on his face turned stormy as he caught sight of her.
"Where th' hole you been, girl?" he demanded,
waving the wrench at her.
"There's work needs done!
An don't give me any excuses!"
he continued as Iffy opened her mouth.
"You get this mended or so help me!"

"But—"

"Now!"
Heads turned on nearby ships as Uncle Jack's bellow echoed across the water.

Iffy's heart sank a second time when she saw the mess waiting for her.
Her uncle had undone the screw cuff holding the frayed backstay cable together
and trimmed the two ends flat.
He hadn't left enough to weave back together,
not without shortening the cable by half a meter.
She would have to swap the whole cable for one of the forestays,
which meant an hour at least of unwinding and hauling.

Uncle Jack crossed his arms,
tapping his wrench against the stained thermal vest
he had worn for as long as Iffy could remember.
"So where you been while th' rest of us been workin', eh?"

"Groceries," Iffy said sullenly.
She pulled the mended reciprocating rod out of her jacket and held it up.
"Got this fixed too."

Uncle Jack pulled it roughly from her hand.
"Don't see no groceries," he grumbled accusingly,
squinting at the rod
before thrusting it back at her.

"I just asked her to pick up a couple o' things,"
Aunt Naggie said,
sticking her head up through an open hatch
like a turtle cautiously checking that the world outside its shell was safe.
"Did they have eggs?"

"Nope, but I got some peppers."
Iffy fished the items she had bought out of her jacket's deep pockets.
"Oh, an' this is from Little Mrs. Sandhu."
She held up the jar of curry powder.

"Oh, that's kind," Aunt Naggie clucked,
tucking everything into her apron.
"Did you get anythin' more to eat?
I was going t' make noodles."

"It's aright, I'm not hungry," Iffy lied,
and then she couldn't hold back any longer.
"But auntie,
there was a man at Sandhu's,
a mechanic come down to work in th' machine shop,
'cept he was on the *Taroona* and they stole his gear
so he was askin' after a place t' stay,
an' we got to talkin',
an' he said that if he could get his tools back an' find work an all,
he might be lookin' for an apprentice."

"An apprentice?" Aunt Naggie echoed.
"Well, good for Jeep.
It's about time he got out and did somethin'."

"Not Jeep!" Iffy exclaimed.
"He said he'd look to take me!"
The two Mrs. Sandhus had listened with bemusement
as her conversation with Mister Wales—"call me Johnson, please"—leaped from de-ionizers
to different ways to micro-weld cracks in core cases
to the mended reciprocating rod Iffy took out of her coat to show him.
It wasn't until Big Mrs. Sandhu had cleared her throat
and pointedly suggested that the conversation continue
where they *wouldn't* be blocking the aisle
that Iffy had realized how much time had gone by.

Uncle Jack's hand came down heavily on her shoulder.
"You're not goin' anywhere," he growled,
shaking her for emphasis.
"Not 'til you've paid off every last rand you owe me
for lookin' after you all this time."

Something froze inside Iffy.
"Aright," she said coldly,
knocking his arm away.
"How 'bout you an' me go ask the *Ginny* to pull up the accounts
so I can see just how much that is,
and I'll tell you how much you owe me
for keeping her afloat when you're too wrung out to do it yourself,
an' then we'll see who owes who what!"

"What we'll see is how well you swim!"
Uncle Jack roared,
raising the heavy wrench he was holding like a club.

"No!"
Aunt Naggie yanked Iffy back and stepped in front of her irate husband.
"Jack, don't!
She's just talkin',
that's all."

Uncle Jack shook the wrench at them.
"I best see more outta both of you than just talkin'," he snarled.
"Now get me some affin' lunch, woman.
And you!"
He jabbed a finger at Iffy.
"Fix that shaddin' cable.
I want us ready to sail tomorrow."

"She'll do it right away, I promise," Aunt Naggie said.
Her arm tightened around Iffy's shoulders,
a silent warning not to say anything.

Uncle Jack stalked off,
muttering under his breath.
"You come below and help me with th' noodles,"
Aunt Naggie said,
shooing Iffy toward the open hatch.
"That'll give him time to calm down."

"Yes auntie," Iffy said,
her voice only slightly shaky.
Uncle Jack had never actually hit her—as simple-minded as the *Guinevere*'s core was,
it would still instantly report that to the Marines
who served as Halley's police.
But with each passing season,
as the *Guinevere* slowly fell apart beneath them despite Iffy's hard work,
his if-only stories about big deals that were just over the horizon
had turned into angry tirades and sullen silences.
Iffy didn't know where she would go,
and she couldn't bear the thought of leaving Aunt Naggie to face him alone,
but she knew that one day soon she was going to walk down the gangplank
and never come back.

One day—but not today.

The *Guinevere*'s galley wasn't big enough for two people to do anything side by side
except get in each other's way,
so Iffy sat at its little fold-down table
and watched Aunt Naggie work with the efficiency of long practice.
Within minutes,
two thinly-sliced onions sizzled in a battered ceramic frying pan
while a pot of desalinated water came to the boil.
A handful of diced mushrooms and a splash of soy sauce joined the onions,
filling the air with a rich aroma that tightened the knot in Iffy's stomach.

The knot turned into an ache as Aunt Naggie added some of her precious spices.
"Is that Mrs. Sandhu's curry?" Iffy asked,
turning a pair of chopsticks over and over in her hands.

"Mm hm."
Aunt Naggie fished the little jar out of her apron,
sprinkled a little into the simmering mixture,
then tucked the jar at the back of her spice shelf.
"I save it for special occasions."
She dropped a thick handful of noodles into the pot,
glanced at her foster daughter,
and added a few more.

Iffy put the chopstick back on the table.
"What's so special 'bout today?" she grumbled.

Aunt Naggie smiled without looking up from her cooking.
"Any time I cook for just th' two of us is special,"
she said,
knocking bits of onion off her spatula into the frying pan.
"But best we don't mention that to Jack, aright?"

"Sure," Iffy said,
feeling a knot in her chest to match the one in her stomach.
She stood up and hugged Aunt Naggie from behind.
"You know I won't leave you, aye?"

Her foster mother's shoulders slumped slightly.
She moved the frying pan off the induction loop
and turned around to wrap her arms around the skinny young woman
who had somehow replaced the skinny little girl
she used to sing songs to at bedtime.
"I love you too, *cho*," she said,
kissing Iffy's shaved head.
"But when your chance comes, you take it, aright?"
She squeezed Iffy.
"Now, scootch over."

A few minutes later Iffy sat down on deck
with her back against the wheelhouse door
and a steaming bowl of noodles in her lap.
She bowed her head and said a brief prayer for the olders she could barely remember,
then began scooping food into her mouth.
Not even the sound of her uncle grumbling belowdecks
could spoil the spicy sweet taste in her mouth
or the feeling of her belly slowly relaxing.

When the noodles were gone
she wiped the last drops of sauce out of the bowl with her thumb
and licked it.
The faint tang of machine oil on her unwashed hand barely registered.
She sighed.
She would like nothing better than to close her eyes and let the summer sun warm her face,
but the backstay cable *did* need mending,
and it wasn't as if the engine was going to put itself back together—not
on a ship as simple-minded as the *Guinevere*.

She patted her coat
to check that the reciprocating rod was still in her pocket
and hauled herself to her feet.
Down at the base of the pier,
one of the barnacle farmers had a pole balanced across her shoulders
with a large bucket on each end.
The other had stacked the smaller buckets on a two-wheeled cart
and was gently lowering their precious sheets of plastic back into the sea.
They would haul in on the next pier tomorrow,
then the next and the next
until their circuit brought them back to where they had started.
They had been doing it since before Iffy was born.
It kept them fed,
but little more,
and Iffy would be damned and drowned before she would let anything like that become her life.

Without warning a sketch materialized somewhere between her eyes and her brain.
Two toothed wheels to reel in the strips of plastic,
a sharp-edged scraper to pry the barnacles off,
a lens connected to a tiny core set just so in a wire frame
to steer the scraper so that it didn't dig into the plastic…
The parts would only cost a dozen rand,
and it would save the old women an hour or two every day.
Mister Mishra had everything except the frame,
but that would be easy to print.
She could actually make it,
she realized with mounting excitement.
She could make it and sell it to the barnacle farmers and—

*BOOM!*
The explosion sounded like someone slamming the world's biggest box down
on the world's biggest table.
A roiling mass of smoke billowed up into the sky on the edge of town.
"Oh shad!" Iffy gasped.
It was the new machine shop!

A siren wailed.
Others joined it.
She heard Uncle Jack bellow,
"What'n hole you done now, girl?"
but she was already racing down the gangplank.

By the time she reached the machine shop
a small crowd had gathered on the paved turnaround in front of it.
Something like panic rose in her throat
when she saw that the explosion hadn't been in the building itself
but in the squat blockhouse beside it
where the industrial printer was sitting in quarantine.

One corner of the blockhouse had collapsed
into a tangle of masonry chunks and twisted foam steel beams.
A rough-looking woman in a green and yellow vest
was standing in front of its single door
arguing loudly with two men in dark blue Marine uniforms.
"An' *I* said I'll open it when my captain tells me to!"
she said hotly,
uncrossing muscular arms thick with tattoos.

Two more Marines pushed through the crowd,
a sidekick drone whining faintly over their heads.
One of them pointed at the sergeant's stripes on his sleeve.
"Do you see these, citizen?" he demanded.
"These indicate that I have authority to direct action
as I think most consistent with regulations regarding general public safety.
We will therefore proceed to inspect this site regardless of your wishes."

The woman's lip curled.
"Consistent wi' regulations, is it?" she mimicked.
"Well that means nought to me,
mate,
so you an' your brainmush friends can—oy!"
She stepped sideways to block one of the Marines
as he moved toward the door.

"Clear away! Clear away, all o' you!"
The crowded parted hastily at the shouted order.
Half a dozen sailors pushed through the crowd,
all of them wearing variations on the woman's yellow-and-green vest
with *Taroona* stencilled on the back.
"Uh oh," Iffy heard someone mutter.

The shaven-headed woman leading the new arrivals put her hands on her hips.
"Y'arra, Bags?" she asked,
glaring at the Marine sergeant,
the crowd,
and everything else in sight for good measure.

"Kappa, cap'n," the first woman growled.
"Just 'splainin' t' these lot that there ain't nothin' here needs corra look-in."

"With respect, citizen," the sergeant said,
his inducted accent making his calm words ridiculous and ominous at the same time,
"Any potential danger to the residents or property of Halley
is a proper subject of our attention.
Particularly anything that might turn us into another Bharati."

The crowd murmured.
Twenty years before,
someone's home-brew tech had gone up in flames in Bharati.
Dozens had died as fire swept through the small town,
and dozens more from exposure in the days that followed.
Iffy had never asked Mister Mishra about that night,
but every year,
on the anniversary,
he and the Sandhus and their friends gathered on the piers
to toss handfuls of precious flowers into the sea.

The *Taroona*'s crew ignored the mutters of "Too right" and "Just let 'em look"
from the crowd.
One sailor hefted a gaff hook.
Another wrapped a length of chain around her hand
as the twin or clone beside her rolled her head from side to side to loosen it.
"Well this ain't Bharati,"
the *Taroona*'s captain said to the sergeant.
"Contract says we're to mind everythin' we hauled down from Taz
'til Halley core tells us otherways,
so whatever happened here is on us t' fix."

The sergeant looked at the debris on the ground.
"Do you regard this as 'taking care', citizen?" has asked pointedly.

The *Taroona*'s captain crossed her arms.
"That ain't our doin'," she said firmly.
"Printer don't have any feedstock in it, not yet.
Couldna made a marble, much less a bomb."
She looked up at the drone circling overhead.
"So *I* think this was someone messin' around tryin' t' do us outta bein' paid,"
she said loudly,
her words aimed at Halley's core and the watching governors.

"I agree your analysis is likely," the sergeant said.
"But I still insist on inspecting this site directly."
In one choreographed motion,
he and the three Marines beside him
drew their shock sticks from the holsters on their hips.

"Oh shad," someone said quietly beside Iffy.
"It's gonna be a jammer."

Iffy gulped.
She had never seen a fight worse than teenagers shoving each other,
but Uncle Jack had been in several over the years.
The last time they were in Rothera
he had come back to the *Guinevere* bruised and bloodied
and uncharacteristically quiet about what had happened.
As the Marines' uniform jackets hardened into armor,
she turned to find somewhere safer to be.

And bumped right into Johnson Wales.
"'Scuse me," she muttered before she realized who he was.

"No worries," he said pleasantly.
"I was actually just leaving myself.
Here—could you give me a hand?"
Without waiting for an answer
he handed her a bulky black case with a flip-up handle on its lid
and stooped to pick up its two identical twins.

"What—?" Iffy started to ask.

"Ssh!" Wales cut her off and looked up at the drone circling overhead.
Without warning its buzzing stopped
and it fell from the sky like a rock.

"Oy, that weren't us!" the *Taroona*'s captain protested,
but it was too late.
As the drone clattered on the cobblestones,
the sergeant blew his whistle.
Moving as one,
the squad charged the sailors.

A shock stick sizzled and cracked.
Someone shouted an obscenity,
and suddenly people were running past Iffy
as the sailors and Marines did what sailors and Marines have been doing
for as long as there have been sailors and Marines.

"Come on," Wales urged Iffy.
She hurried after him,
the case bumping against her leg.

"Oy!" a voice shouted.
"You there!
Where th' hole d'you think you're goin'?"
A rangy man in a yellow-and-green vest with a half-star tattooed on his face
shoved a couple of people out of his way and grabbed Iffy by the arm.

And there it was in her head,
like a wireframe of a machine labelled with angles and velocities.
Without thinking she spun around,
swinging the case in a sharp arc.
Its rising edge hit the *Taroona* crewman beneath his knee with a crack.

"Aargh! Shaddin' hack, ya wheezy—"
The case in Wales' right hand thudded against the sailor's head.
He collapsed to the cobblestones in a heap.

"Come on!"
Wales urged as two of the *Taroona*'s crew spotted their fallen comrade
and began shoving their way through the panic to even the score.

Iffy ran,
or tried to,
but the case was heavy and awkward
and the women chasing her were half again her height
and could knock people aside instead of going around them
or pushing in between them and what had just happened?
How could she have seen what she needed to do like that?

Just as one of the sailors yelled, "Gotcha!" another voice shouted "*Gardez-vous!*"
Iffy yelped as a familiar rust-stained bot reared up in front of her.
The sailor behind her skidded to a halt on the cobblestones
and was knocked sprawling as her partner slammed into her from behind.

"Rogue! Rogue!"
the second sailor shouted,
dodging back as French Henry clacked a manipulator at her.

"Come on!"
Wales pulled her away.

For a few moments all Iffy could do was try not to stumble and fall.
Just when she couldn't hold onto the case any longer
Wales pulled her into a side alley.
A few drops of sweat glistened on his forehead.
"Are you all right?" he panted.

Iffy dropped the case on the ground and doubled over to catch her breath.
"No, I'm not aright," she wheezed.
"I just about got my chomper clocked back there!
And what's this?"
She kicked the case with the toe of her boot.
"This what th' *Taroona* bikkies upped from you?"

Wales nodded.
"Everything that matters."
Tiny lights danced briefly across the silver rectangles in his temples.
He looked up as an angry drone buzzed overhead.
Another followed it a moment later.
"Come on.
The Marines have called for reinforcements—we should be somewhere else when they arrive."

Wales led her out the other end of the alley
onto a narrow street lined with two-story houses made of laser-cut stones.
Sparkling blue-green moss traced their mortared joints.
It was strangely quiet after the commotion on the street—the only sounds were the gulls,
the faint hum of a heavy drone passing nearby,
and their boots on the cobblestones.

Iffy struggled to keep up with Wales
as he strode confidently toward the center of town.
The sailors and townsfolk she knew ranged from lean to stringy—cold weather
and the sparse Antarctic diet didn't give bodies much chance to put on weight.
Wales' broad shoulders made him look boxy by comparison,
and the cases he was carrying seemed much smaller in his hands than in hers.

"Hang up a jif," Iffy finally said.
Wales stopped as she set her load down on the ground and caught her breath.
Between the Marines' inducted fighting skills,
their drones,
and their armor,
the *Taroona*'s sailors would have had about as much chance
as a snowball in Aunt Naggie's frying pan.
"Sometimes folk fight just so they can tell themselves they did,"
Aunt Naggie had explained after one of Uncle Jack's misadventures.
"Sometimes tryin' is the only kind of winnin' you can hope for."

"*Mon ami! Mon ami!*"
She jumped and squawked as French Henry clattered around the corner,
its dented optics swinging from side to side.
The fixit bot skittered to a halt a few meters away.
"*Ça va bien!*" it announced proudly.
"*Ça va tres bien!*"

"What's it sayin'?" Iffy whispered loudly,
unconsciously backing up a step.
Halley tolerated a handful of free bots for the jobs they could do,
but there were too many stories of machines driven mad by malware left over from the war
for anyone to ever be truly comfortable around something as big as French Henry.

Wales didn't seem bothered in the least.
"*Merci beaucoup, mon vieux.*"
He pulled something that looked like a little gray waffle out of his pocket.
"*Ici. C'est à vous.*"

A hatch on the fixit bot's front panel popped open.
A slender manipulator as long as Iffy's arm unfolded
to pluck the object from in Wales' hand.
It was a heat exchanger,
Iffy realized,
a tiny sibling of one that Mister Mishra had repaired for her
the last time the *Guinevere* was in dock.

A blueprint materialized in her head.
The heat exchanger belonged *there*
in the housing around the fixit bot's quantum core.
Except it hadn't actually been designed to do maintenance.
It was an infiltrator designed to worm its way through sewers and outflow pipes.
Half its parts had been replaced by mis-matched odds and ends taken from other bots
or hacked together out of scrap metal when the tech to make the real thing had been lost,
but its original design was still there beneath the patchwork.

Her vision disappeared
as French Henry's slender manipulator folded back into its housing.
"*Merci beaucoup,*" it said,
rocking back and forth in what might have been the mechanical equivalent of a dog wagging its tail
before rolling away toward the docks
saying, "*Gardez-vous! Gardez-vous!*" once more.

"What was *that* all about?"
Iffy demanded.

Wales shrugged.
"Just a hard-to-find part to help an old friend," he said,
sounding fond and sad at the same time
as the bot disappear around the corner.
"Come on—we should get going."

"Uh huh.
Must be pretty affin' special for it to take a chance on bein' scrapped
for scarin' people like it did back there."
When Wales didn't answer she prodded the case next to her with her boot again.
"So was that you? The 'splosion back there?"

Wales blinked.
"Why on earth would you think that was me?"

Iffy rolled her eyes.
"Cuz they upped your gear an' then the blockhouse blew up
an' then the bot that takes care o' the town's sewers an' all
just happens t' be a friend o' yours
an' now you got your stuff back?
I ain't *stupid*," she finished disgustedly.
Why did grownups always think kids were stupid?

"No you're not," Wales agreed thoughtfully.
He nodded at the case next to her feet.
"Are you okay to carry that a bit further?"

Iffy crossed her arms in unconscious imitation of the *Taroona*'s captain
and raised an eyebrow.

Wales smiled briefly.
"Sorry.
Arra kappa t' carry at down s'far we go long?"

Iffy made a face.
"That was *terrible*," she judged witheringly.
"And sure, but only if I get t'see what's in it."

Wales chuckled.
"Fair enough. Come on."
He glanced up as one last drone zipped past overhead.
Lights sparkled briefly in the rectangle set into his temple,
making Iffy wonder how honestly the drones were reporting the scene
to Halley's central core.

They picked up their loads and walked side by side
past the Sandhus' grocery
to the café where Wales had rented an upstairs room.
The owner glanced from Wales to Iffy to the cases
but said nothing more than, "Tea?"

They sat at the café's single stone-topped table
and sipped the strong, minty brew from mis-matched ceramic mugs
the size of Iffy's doubled fists.
Wales sighed contentedly,
then set his mug aside,
lifted the case Iffy had been carrying onto the table,
and opened it.

"Whoa," Iffy breathed.
Some of the tools inside looked as good as new,
though they had to be at least a hundred years old—only
a handful of well-defended factories scattered around the world
still had the cleanrooms and nano-fabricators needed
to create marvels like the fractal iridium mesh that
Wales briefly let her inspect
through a monocle made from a single perfectly-formed diamond.
Other tools were clearly cobbled together
from whatever spare parts Wales had been able to find.
Iffy felt more comfortable with these,
since pretty much everything in Halley was built the same way.

"An' what about those?" she asked eagerly,
pointing at a nested set of asymmetric gears
as Wales carefully repacked everything.

The square man chuckled.
"Let's save them for another time."
The squares in his temples flickered.
"The town says the explosion by the quarantine shed
was apparently a result of faulty maintenance
on an outflow pipe that wasnt't registered in the town plans.
Oh,
and the Marines have resolved the disturbance
involving the crew of an unnamed Australian vessel."

Iffy snorted.
"Faulty maintenance my orphaned arse.
I know that was you."

"I'm sure I have no idea what you mean,"
Wales said drily.

"Uh huh."
Iffy glanced at the clock painted on café wall.
"Oh crivens," she swore,
scrambling to her feet.
She'd been gone nearly half an hour—Aunt Naggie would be worried sick
and Uncle Jack would be furious.

"Hold on," Wales said, patting the air.
"Just a minute, I promise.
Tell me more about this ship of yours…"

Wales locked his toolboxes in his room before they left
and put a small toy bear with bright blue eyes on the shelf above them.
"To keep an eye on things,"
he said,
tapping the tech in his temple.
Iffy nodded—smart toys were an everyday thing,
even for someone who had grown up as poor as she had.
She didn't know what the orange-and-red globe of Mars next to the bear was for,
but she suspected it would do more than just watch if someone broke in.

A pair of bulky gray drones hovered over the harbor
as Iffy and Wales walked down to the pier.
"Keeping an eye on the *Taroona*," Wales guessed,
shielding his eyes with his hand to study them.
"Those forks on the front are ultrasonics.
One zap from them and you'll have a headache for a week.
The nozzles behind them probably spray strangle foam."

"Why are they just watchin'?" Iffy asked.
"Why don't th' Marines just haul everyone in for th' governors to sort out?"

Wales sighed.
"Politics.
Even if they *did* blow up the quarantine building,
the *Taroona* and the rest of the Australian fleet
are the only thing stopping the Brazilians from walking in here.
Odds are the captain and her crew will be back on the dock by morning,"
he continued,
speaking to himself as much as to the frowning tween beside him.
"Which is another reason I need to talk to your uncle."

"Y'oughta know he don't keep his word 'less it suits him,"
Iffy warned.
"Or 'less he figures you got some serious haul back o' you."

Wales nodded.
"Thank you—I'll keep that in mind."

Ten minutes later Uncle Jack shouted,
"No affin' way!
We're a jelly dredger,
not an affin' ferryboat!
You wanna hitch up along Rothera,
get yourself three piers over an' buy a ticket."

Wales' polite expression didn't waver.
"I understand it's not your usual line of work,"
he said smoothly
when the *Guinevere*'s bleary-eyed captain paused for breath.
"And if no is your final answer,
I'll respect that and take my business elsewhere.
But!"
He held up a hand to forestall another outburst.
"What if I could do more than just pay for my passage?"

Uncle Jack snorted.
He had been dozing when Iffy and Wales reached the *Guinevere*,
and from his squint and the smell on his breath
Iffy guessed that she'd find at least one empty bottle in the recycling
if she bothered to go and look.
"Lemme guess—you can sing.
Or no—you can do magic tricks an' turn jellyfish into gold."

"Almost," Wales nodded.
"Except it isn't magic, and gold will be all yours."
He tapped the tech in his temple.
"This is a satellite uplink.
A *fully functional* satellite uplink,"
he continued as Uncle Jack opened his mouth.
"Which means I can spot patches of sea boil with half an hour to spare.
Maybe a full hour, if a satellite is in the right positions.
And *that* means—"

Uncle Jack said a word that sent Aunt Naggie's hands flying to her mouth.
"Ain't no such thing,"
the *Guinevere*'s captain sneered.
"Not since the war—everyone knows that.
The sats are all 'crypted an' th' keys are long gone."

"They are indeed encrypted," Wales nodded.
"But as for the keys…"
He closed his eyes.
"Your beacon is GUIN40782, is that right?"
He nodded to himself without waiting for an answer.
"Your last trip, you were at sea nine days.
You spent most of it over the Berkner Rise."

"So what?" Uncle Jack contemptuously.
"Everyone 'round here dredges th' Berk."

"Some with more luck than others," Wales observed coolly.
"Take the *Whitstable*, for example.
The jellyfish they brought back came up in a boil
just twenty kay northeast of you.
If you'd known it was happening,
they could have been yours."

Uncle Jack scowled.
The *Whitstable* was tied up two piers over,
her captain overseeing a refit
paid for by the full hold she had brought back
the day after the *Guinevere* had returned.
Her crew had been celebrating their good fortune in Halley's shops and bars ever since.

Uncle Jack scratched his cheek through his uncombed beard.
Iffy could practically hear him resenting the other ship's good luck.
"You're shaddin' me," he growled.
"There's no way you could know somethin' like that 'fore it happened."

Wales didn't answer.
Instead,
he closed his eyes again and pointed toward the *Guinevere*'s stern.
"There's a pair of Aussie freighters a hundred and forty kay that way,
core pilots and human crews,
carrying…"
He paused.
"Profile looks like grain,
but they have something heavier for ballast.
Smuggling in machinery to swap for coal, most likely."
He pivoted twenty degrees like a weathervane.
"The *Peacock*, the *Reculver*, and the *Watney Breach* are dredging together.
They're not going to find much—the sea bottom there
might as well be concrete."
He pivoted again.
"And there's a Brazilian catamaran out that way,
three hundred kay and bearing northwest."
He smiled slightly.
"She looks like an old lady dressed up for church."

He turned back toward them and opened his eyes.
"I can get all of it,"
he said in a voice that left no room for doubt or disagreement.
"Every image, every signal.
And I need to get to Rothera.
The only question is, will that be your good fortune or someone else's?"

Uncle Jack hefted his gaff hook.
"Jack," Aunt Naggie began.

"Quiet," he snapped, greed and mistrust warring on his face.
"We keep whatever we haul," he finally said.
"An' th' moment we tie up,
you're off an' I never heard o' you."

"Fair enough," Wales agreed.
He stuck out his hand.

Iffy held her breath.
Uncle Jack scowled a moment longer,
then grabbed it and gave it a single perfunctory shake.
"I'm guessin' you'll want t' be off right away," he said sourly.

Wales nodded.
"Just as soon as I collect my—"
He froze.

"What?" Uncle Jack demanded.
Wales raised a hand for silence, his eyes half-closed.

"Oh no," Uncle Jack blustered,
drawing himself up to his full height.
"You don't shush me on my ship, you—"

"Someone is breaking into my room."
Wales said curtly.
"Warm up the engines and get ready to cast off.
I'll be back in ten minutes."

"We'll cast off when *I* say!"
Uncle Jack said angrily.

Iffy's heart sank.
Telling Uncle Jack what to do *always* made him do the opposite.

But her uncle's anger had no more effect on Wales
than a windstorm would on a mountain.
"Here."
He pulled a money out of his jacket and thrust it at Uncle Jack.
"A down payment."

Uncle Jack turned the black plastic rectangle over in his hands suspiciously.
"What's it worth?"

"Six thousand rand," Wales said.

"Six *thousand*?"
Uncle Jack pressed his thumb on the corner of the money.
His eyes widened at the blinking figures it displayed,
then narrowed again as he looked Wales up and down.
"You must wanna get outta here pretty badly,"
he mused.

"It's no use to me if I can't spend it,"
Wales said crisply.
"Do we still have a deal?"

Uncle Jack pocketed the card and grunted something unintelligible.
"Thank you," Wales said. "I'll be quick."
He turned to go, then stopped himself and tapped the tech in his temple.
"Just so you know, this is still switched on.
So if you try to call the Marines, I'll know."

Uncle Jack spat over the taffrail.
"Ain't nobody here calls th' Blues," he growled.

"And none of your business associates either, please,"
Wales added coolly.
"Or I'll send the Marines to call on *them*
and make it look like you did."

Wales strode down the gangplank before Uncle Jack could reply,
lengthening his stride into a jog
that carried him along the pier and into town.
"That one's trouble," Uncle Jack said flatly.
He leaned his elbows on the taffrail,
cleared his throat,
and spat again into the water below.
There was more gray in his beard than there used to be,
Iffy thought,
and the three-day fuzz on his shaved scalp
had crept further and further away from his forehead.

Uncle Jack noticed her looking at him.
"Well, get movin'!" he barked,
straightening up.
"You too, woman," he added to Aunt Naggie.
"I want us away from whatever's chasin' him soon as he's back."
He strode away,
muttering to himself.

Aunt Naggie and Iffy whooshed out their breath at the same time.
"You gonna tell me what's abunder?" Aunt Naggie asked.

Iffy shrugged helplessly.
"I dunno, auntie, true I don't.
There was a jammer up along by quarantine,
an' French Henry got into it, and…"
*And all of a sudden I know how to tag someone twice my size,*
she almost added but didn't.
Bots weren't the only ones infected with malware during the war.
Talking about her visions with anyone—even Aunt Naggie—would mean
opening a door she would rather stay closed.

But something in her expression caught Aunt Naggie's eye.
She put her hand on Iffy's forehead.
"Just be still," she shushed,
stern and worried at the same time.
After a moment she took her hand away,
but her expression didn't change.
"There's no fever.
How about you start gettin' us ready an' I'll make somethin' quick to eat?"

"Tea'd be nice," Iffy said gratefully.

It normally took a full day to get the *Guinevere* ready to sail,
but the money in Uncle Jack's pocket seemed to make him believe it could be done in a blink.
He roared at Iffy and Aunt Naggie to move their sorry sterns,
and no,
don't worry about tyin' that down,
they could take care of it once they were at sea,
just put it somewhere for now and get the affin' engine goin!

It took Iffy five minutes of careful work to put the reciprocating rod back in place.
Five more minutes and the engine was chugging away,
biofuel gurgling through kinks in the feed pipe
that she had never been able to get rid of.
She would normally have checked the winch motor
to make sure they could haul in whatever they caught,
but instead she laced some straps around the fine mesh dredging nets
to stop them shifting or tangling in high seas.
Wait—the fuel hose!
It was still connected to the pump on the pier.
If they had set sail without undoing it,
it would have snapped like an overstretched rubber band.
She had seen that happen once.
It had sounded like a gunshot,
and the end had torn open an unlucky sailor's cheek.

She scrambled up the ladder that connected the engine room to the deck.
"Ready below," she called.

Aunt Naggie coiled the last stayline and shoved it into a canvas bag,
then shoved the bag into a bench locker and dogged the seat-lid shut.
"That's all for me too."
She handed Iffy half a sandwich—scrambled egg with more of Mrs. Sandhu's spice mix—and
waited for her foster daughter to wolf it down
before thumping the cabin wall with her fist.
"Good when you are," she shouted,
confident as she always was when something needed to be done.

The cabin door flew open.
Uncle Jack stepped out onto deck,
glaring at his wife and foster daughter on principle.
"That's what I said," he told the empty air impatiently.
"Six thousand rand.
I'll have it in a week.
What?
Never you mind how, but that'll more'n put us square.
Right.
Aright.
What?
No, you affin' well better *not* tell her,
or she'll skin both of us!
Right.
Aright.
*Vi da*."
He blinked twice to end the call and bared his teeth.

"Who was that?" Aunt Naggie asked cautiously.

Uncle Jack's self-satisfied smile vanished.
"Ne'er you mind," he said brusquely.
"Everythin' stowed?"

"Everythin' that's gonna be," Aunt Naggie said.
"But Jack—"

"I said, ne'er mind!"
He slapped the taffrail with his hand.
"Now where's our high-top troublemaker?"

Five minutes crawled by,
each one tenser than the last,
until Wales appeared at the end of the pier
with one toolbox in each hand.
The third hung over his shoulder on a strap,
and he had a small travelling pack on his back.

Iffy scurried down the gangplank and ran to him.
"Thank you,"
Wales said gratefully
as she took one of the boxes from his hand.

"No worries," Iffy replied.
Then she gasped.
"You're bleeding!"

"Still?"
Wales pulled a rag out of his pocket,
dabbed at his nose,
and studied the red blotch a moment.
"So I am."
He put the rag back in his pocket and limped toward the *Guinevere*.

"What happened?"
Iffy puffed as she fell into step beside him.
"Was someone really tryin' t' break into your room?
Were they along from the *Taroona*?
Did you get punched up?
An' what's wrong with your leg?"

"Oh, everything was mostly sorted out by the time I got there,"
Wales said vaguely.
"And my leg's bothered me for years.
I keep meaning to get it looked at,
but I never seem to have time.
There's just never enough time," he repeated.

Uncle Jack didn't wait for Wales to stow his belongings
before hauling in the gangplank and casting off.
The engine rumbled and coughed for a moment
as they pulled away from the pier,
then settled into the steady thumping that was as familiar to Iffy as her own breathing.

They were halfway across the harbor
when a klaxon blared *brrrap! brrrap!*
Iffy ran to the stern in time to see
a flock of drones converge on a pier halfway around the harbor
from the *Guinevere*'s berth.

A single ship lay alongside the pier,
long and low and gray and dangerous—the *Taroona*.
Iffy shaded her eyes with her hand.
The ship looked like she was casting off,
but no,
a pair of Marine cutters had boxed her in
and a platoon of figures in blue were trotting down the pier.
She glanced at Wales,
wondering if this was somehow his doing,
but the American's eyes were on the horizon ahead of them.

They rounded the broken-backed carrier that was Halley's seawall a few minutes later.
The swell beneath them instantly grew stronger.
Uncle Jack took the first watch,
grumbling that if they were hauled in by the Marines
everyone should just let him do the talking.
Aunt Naggie said she would take the second watch,
then shooed Iffy off to sleep.
"You can talk to Mister Johnson in the morning,"
she said firmly.
"Let him have his rest now."
Then she smiled the way she only did
when she and her foster daughter were alone together.
"You'll need some too
if you're gonna go chattin' up that special friend o' yours."

"Honesty ain't special!" Iffy protested automatically.
Still smiling,
her foster mother pulled her into a hug and kissed the shaven top of her head,
then gently pulled the door of the storage locker closed behind her.

Iffy took her nature book out from under her mattress
and lay on her stomach to page through it.
The orca, the tiger, the gorilla…
She ran her fingers over the pictures,
sounding out the handwritten comments beside them.
*Mom took us to see the baby giraffes today,* said one.
*There are three of them.
They are all clones and they live in a big dome because of the virus.
Mom says they have been tweaked to be immune to it.*
And then,
in an older version of the same hand,
*Turns out they weren't.
Mom says there isn't money to try again.*
And then there was a sad cartoon face,
one of several scattered through the book.

Iffy browsed the other animals,
wondering what it would have been like to live in a world
that had so many different kinds of creatures.
She stubbornly tried to keep her eyelids from closing
until she couldn't remember why they shouldn't.
When she finally dozed, she dreamed.

*She was on deck.
The sky was a perfect blue,
and her olders were stuffing her into her ecosuit.
"Just in case, love," Second said, forcing a smile.*

*When the ship's horn blared it wasn't a horn at all
but the sound of a drill press.
She was in Mister Mishra's,
fumbling clumsily to reassemble a mound of chips and gears and actuators
that she had never seen before.
Her heart raced as she tried to piece them together.
This rod into that socket—no,
that couldn't be right,
it turned the wrong way and didn't leave enough space for the lens,
because the lens had to go there,
it had to,
she didn't know how she knew but she did and time was running out.*

*And then suddenly she could see the whole design
from the overall schematic
down to the bevelled teeth of the microscopic gears
that would catch and grind on specks of dust too small to see or feel
if they weren't assembled just so in airtight diamond cases.
There and there,
that's where the hair-fine optical fibers had to go,
and there,
right in the machine's heart,
was the space where a miniaturized core could—*

*The whole room heeled hard, throwing her to the floor.
"She's gonna blow!" Mister Mishra shouted,
and then all Iffy could hear was a rushing sound
as the ship fell away beneath her into a pit of churning foam.*

She woke up drenched in sweat.
She kicked her way out of her sleeping back,
rolled over,
and buried her face in her mattress.
When her tears finally ran dry she wiped her nose angrily on her sleeve,
rolled over on her back,
and fumbled on the floor beside her for her water bottle
before remembering that she hadn't refilled it.
"Idiot," she muttered,
thumping her fist against her mattress.

It took her a long time to fall asleep again.

## Chapter 3

It was four days to Rothera across the Weddell Sea.
Once upon a time their route would have taken them over a solid sheet of ice.
During the Melt they would have had to thread their way between cakes and bergs,
but those days were long gone too.
There was nothing between them and their destination except
floating plastic,
the inevitable gulls,
and the waves.

In no time at all Halley had fallen below the horizon.
After motoring for an hour under thin, high clouds,
Uncle Jack ordered the *Guinevere* to raise her sails.
The ship's tiny core obediently ran mis-matched gossamer sheets up her twin Y-masts.
Waves a meter high made the *Guinevere* rock from side to side in a rhythm
that Iffy knew as well as she knew her own heartbeat.

"Best stay outta his way," Aunt Naggie advised
when her foster daughter clambered down into the galley to get tea.
"He ain't used t' havin' folk on board, but I 'spect he'll settle in."
It sounded more like a prayer than a prediction,
but Iffy nodded and climbed back on deck
with a chipped ceramic mug in her hand.

"'Bout affin' time," her uncle said sharply
when she knocked on the door of the pilot house
and handed him the mug.
He slurped a mouthful and set it in the ring next to the ship's wheel.

Iffy glanced at the control panel.
Tiny cameras dotted about the ship showed the engine,
the hold,
the sails,
and practically everywhere else on the ship
except the insides of the cabins and the tiny toilet near the stern.
Small graphs scattered among the images told her at a glance
how much fuel they had,
how much tension was in the forestays and mainstays,
and what the wind and the currents around them were doing.

The most important display was the sonar.
Every captain kept a close eye on that if they wanted to make it home.
At the first sign of gas bubbling up from the ocean floor,
they would fire up the engine and run.

Uncle Jack jerked a thumb at a panel highlighted in orange.
"You get that backstay cable mended soonish if you want lunch,"
he growled.

"Yessir," Iffy said obediently.
He'd been drinking again, she realized.
She could smell it on his breath,
and from the way he clutched the wheel to hold himself steady
she guessed he'd been at it for a while.

"An' see if that baggage o' yours wants t' make himself useful as well,"
Uncle Jack added as she turned to go.
"Or better yet, just tell 'im I told him to!"

Wales had reorganized the ship's other storage locker while Iffy was asleep
to make room for his pack and toolboxes.
He was seated on a thwart at the *Guinevere*'s stern,
seemingly lost in thought as Iffy approached him,
but said, "Of course," in reply to Iffy's tentative request for help.
Standing,
he straightened his jacket and smiled.
"Being useful would do me good right now."

"You thinkin' bout them off th' *Taroona*?
Not that it's any o' my look-in,"
she added hastily.

Wales shook his head.
"No,
I was thinking about the *Landrieu*.
The big ship back at Halley,"
he continued as Iffy gave him a blank look.
"The one the town uses as a breakwater.
She was a marvel in her time.
Fractal carbon ribs,
a foamed poly-composite hull,
and a core smart enough to qualify for citizenship.
She was the first of her kind to solo the Pacific,
but then the war came, and…"
He sighed.
"It must have broken her heart to up like this."

"I guess," Iffy said to fill the silence that followed.
"Can't imagine how I'd feel if somethin' like that happened to th' *Ginny*.
Or to me,"
she added after a moment's thought.

Wales shook his head to clear it.
"Let's hope you never have to find out," he said,
suddenly brisk.
"Now, where's this cable we're supposed to splice?"

Iffy had hoped that Wales would bring out his toolboxes—she
was itching to examine their contents in detail—but instead,
he studied the hacked-off ends of the backstay cable
with a hand-held smart lens
that highlighted the worse of the damage in garish reds and yellows.
Iffy wanted to tell him that the damage wasn't her fault,
but she bit back her words.
There was no way she could say that without pointing the finger at Uncle Jack,
and as much as she wanted him to think well of her as a mechanic,
no self-respecting sailor would ever cast shade on her captain
in front of a passenger.

"All right," Wales said,
slipping the magnifier back into one of his coat's many pockets.
"What's the plan—splice, clamp, strap, or weld?"

"I was thinkin' I could splice it?" Iffy ventured hesitantly.
When Wales nodded
she fished a roll of twisted eight-gauge cable from her bag of odds and ends
and dug around to find a wire cutter and a pair of needle-nosed pliers.

The next half hour flew by as Iffy lost herself in the task at hand.
She had expected Wales to take charge,
but instead he asked one question after another,
drawing ideas out of her that she hadn't know were there.
It was like the schematics that sometimes popped into her head
but without the chill in her gut of not knowing where they came from.

Once the first dozen lengths of splice were woven into the cable
Wales sat cross-legged on the deck and held the ends together
so that Iffy could finish connecting them.
She worked as quickly as she could,
waiting for him to say it was time for a break,
but he didn't.
*Uncle Jack wouldn't have been able to hold the cable like that,* she thought.
Even Mister Mishra would have struggled after a minute or two,
but Wales seemed unbothered.
She glanced at the silver rectangles in his temples
and wondered what other tech he might have that wasn't so visible.

Over, through, under, through…
"There." She sat back on her haunches.
"Wanna see if it holds together?"

Wales stood,
trapped one end of the cable under his boot,
and pulled hard.
The splice stretched slightly,
and for a moment Iffy was afraid it would give way,
but it held.
"Looks good to me.
Well done."

Iffy shrugged, embarrassed by the praise.
"Only one way t' find out for sure."
She hit the switch on the winch beside her.
The cable zinged as it was wound taut.
Iffy picked up a wrench and whacked the splice a couple of times as hard as she could.

Wales blinked. "Are you always this direct when you're working?"

Iffy grinned. "Pretty much."

There were other things to mend after the cable.
There always were on the *Guinevere*:
a spidery network of microscopic cracks on the forward mast,
a loose coupling on a bilge pipe,
and a handle on the main hatch
that had started sticking mid-way through their last voyage.
Like most of the vessels that called Halley home
the *Guinevere* was constructed from materials that could no longer be made,
only repaired.
Keeping her afloat was a matter of swaps and trades and patches,
of scouring noticeboards in Hell
to find tips that weren't self-replicating spamotage left over from the war,
of swapping messages with other mechanics
trying to keep their own ships running,
and of running sims to see if this patched with that
would hold together in sub-zero temperatures.
In the end,
though,
it always came down to the combination of clever hands,
brute force,
and improvisation that Iffy had used on the cable.
She loved it.

Wales worked beside her the whole time,
handing her tools,
holding things steady while she screwed them in
or used her cherished little laser to put a patch on a weld
that held an even older patch in place.
He somehow managed to keep up a steady stream of questions
without ever making her feel like he was pestering her.
She enjoyed every minute of it,
just like she enjoyed the times
when Mister Mishra turned something she'd made over and over in his hands
and pronounced it well done,
or when Uncle Jack was sound asleep
and Aunt Naggie told her stories about growing up in KwaZulu
before the long drought.

Wales seemed to enjoy the work as well,
right up until the moment he helped Iffy lift the cover off the backup motor
near the *Guinevere*'s stern.
His face fell at the sight of its compact, soot-stained bulk.
"Y'aright?" Iffy asked,
fanning away the smell.

"I'm fine," Wales said,
gazing down at the filthy ceramic engine block.
"I just thought you ran on jelly render, not coal dust."

"The main engine's a jelly-burner," Iffy said.
"This here is just for when it's bust,
or for haulin' the winches when there's ice 'n' all."

The square-faced man sighed.
"But—coal? Really?"

Iffy's eyes widened.
"Oh crivens—you ain't an Eco, are you?
Uncle Jack'll put you o'er the side an' no mistake.
He hates Ecos even worse'n he hates Zillions."

Wales sighed again.
"No, I'm not an Ecologist.
Or Brazilian, for that matter.
I just…"
He squatted on his haunches
and looked resignedly at the engine.
"Come on. Let's get this done."

He asked fewer questions after that,
but despite his obvious distaste
he clearly knew how coal engines worked.
Half an hour after they started,
the lasers that ignited the coal dust it used for fuel
were sparking and zapping in perfect time
and the cinder clog that had been blocking the intake pipe
had finally been dislodged.
She would normally have let the engine run for a few minutes to test it,
but the thought of Wales not saying anything if she did
made her leave it for later.

Aunt Naggie made noodles for lunch.
The smell of synthetic coconut milk,
greenhouse peppers,
diced mushrooms,
and spices made the galley as warm and as comfortable as an old sweater.
"Just for you," Aunt Naggie whispered to Iffy,
spooning a bit of Mrs. Sandhu's curry powder into her foster daughter's bowl
when Uncle Jack's back was turned.

Wales thanked Aunt Naggie profusely before taking his up onto deck to eat.
"I like watching the waves," he explained
when she protested that the galley could hold four.

"Foolishness,"
Uncle Jack muttered as soon as Wales was gone,
though whether he meant the idea of trying to squeeze four people around the galley's little table
or the idea of watching waves for pleasure
he didn't say.
He stabbed a chunk of mushroom with a chopstick and stuffed it into his mouth.
"I don't like 'im.
Bet there's more'n just th' *Taroona*'s crew lookin' for 'im, too.
Hell,
I bet someone would pay double what he's givin' us
to know where he's at."
He stabbed another piece of mushroom.

Iffy ate in silence, head down.
The safest thing to do when Uncle Jack got a money-making idea
was to wait for it to pass—pointing out the holes was the surest way to make him actually do it,
just to prove that no one could tell *him* which way was up.
And while she still knew next to nothing about their passenger,
she had the feeling that double-crossing Wales
might actually be the dumbest idea Uncle Jack had ever had.

She and Aunt Naggie cleaned up afterward.
"He seems nice," Aunt Naggie observed
as she scraped the last traces of sauce off a plate into the composter.
"Handy, too."

"Mm hm," Iffy agreed
around one last rubbery noodle.
"Might even be able to talk th' core into bein' a little less stupid
if Uncle Jack'll let him take a crack at it."

"Oh now, wouldn't that be nice?" Aunt Naggie sighed wistfully.
"No more sittin' up in th' middle of th' night
wonderin' if the ship's gonna get a notion to head for Argentina or somethin'."

"But then when would you knit?" Iffy asked,
nudging her foster mother with her elbow.
Aunt Naggie blushed.
Her "knitting" consisted of two balls of yarn,
a pair of needles,
and an endless series of romance sims
featuring dashing Zillion smugglers with smoldering eyes
who didn't realize how empty their lives were until they met the right person,
who was inevitably a poor but honest sailor.
The sims were churned out by a core in Rothera
that had spent the war crafting inspirational propaganda for soldiers and civilians.
Their implausibility and steamy dialogue
only added to the thrill Iffy felt
whenever she managed to get an hour alone with Aunt Naggie's app.

"Never you mind about my knittin'," Aunt Naggie said primly.
"You're on watch tonight,
so you best nap.
I'll wake you when."
She kissed the top of her foster daughter's head as Iffy groaned.
"Off with you now."

Wales was back on the thwart at the stern when Iffy got topside,
his empty bowl in his lap.
She hesitated,
wanting to talk but not knowing what to say,
then slipped silently into her converted storage locker.
Taken by a sudden restlessness,
she spent five minutes rearranging her meager possessions
before flopping down on her bed and pulling out her nature book.
The giraffe, the tiger, the wolf with his sad, intelligent eyes…
Someone had written *Looks like Grandad!!!* beside it in tiny curving script.
Iffy had long ago decided that the writer had been a girl about her own age
who had a family and a whole pack of friends.
She closed the book,
tucked it back into her mattress,
and squeezed her eyes shut.

A soft chime in her ear woke her.
She sat up and stretched,
then dug the sleep out of the corners of her eyes.
Her windowless room was completely dark,
but her hands found her clothes on the floor beside her foam slab.
She pulled them on over the onesie she had slept in,
slipped her feet into her boots,
and went out to face another day on the southern ocean.

Aunt Naggie nodded to Iffy when she reached the pilot house.
"Sleep well?"

Iffy yawned and plopped herself onto the stool beside her foster mother.
"'Saright. How's she doin'?"
She studied the control panel for a moment.
There was a bit too much tension in the mainsail,
and wind drag over the hull was ten percent higher
than the ship's simple-minded core thought it ought to be,
but that was all normal.
She wondered wistfully what it would be like to have tech in her head
that would let her feel the ship
the way she felt the sun on her face
or the sting of the spray on her skin in a high sea.
She knew it would never happen:
stuff like that had to be implanted at birth
for the brain to learn how to use it.
But she had once paid two carefully-hoarded rand
for five minutes under an induction headset at Halley's midsummer carnival
reliving a glitchy pre-war recording of someone riding a surfboard,
and had fantasized about being the *Guinevere* ever since.

Aunt Naggie nudged her.
"Come about, sleepy head," she chided gently.
Iffy started and straightened.
Her foster mother jerked her chin at the thermos of tea
in the ring holder next to the ship's wheel.
"Fresh made.
Well, fresh-ish," she amended.
"But it'll keep you through a watch."

"Thanks auntie."
Iffy jerked her chin at the panel
as one of the cameras switched views
to show Wales sitting on the thwart at the stern.
"He been there th' whole time?"

"Hasn't budged 'cept to visit th' necessary," Aunt Naggie confirmed.
"Turned on th' sound a while back to ask if he wanted to come an' sit,
but the *Ginny* told me he was talkin' to himself, and…"
She shrugged.
Listening to someone without them knowing was surveillance,
and decent people didn't do that.

"Aright, lemme take over."
Iffy reached past Aunt Naggie
to press her thumb against the dark glass square beside the control panel.
After a moment's hesitation it bleeped and blinked green
to confirm that the ship's core understood a different human was now in charge.

Iffy had scrolled through the core's log many times.
It had been almost sixty years since anyone had last reset it
(probably,
she suspected,
because the holds had been full of contraband instead of jellyfish at the time).
Six watches a day while at sea,
with only a couple of weeks a year tied up or idle,
made for almost a hundred and twenty five thousand thumb presses and bleeps.

She had read the highlights
almost as often as she had read her nature book.
Storms, storms, and more storms as the planet warmed up,
some hurling waves taller than the ship's fully-extended mast across the *Guinevere*'s decks.
Births and deaths and shipboard weddings—Aunt Naggie's parents
had invited a dozen friends on board in Rothera to see her exchange vows with a beaming Uncle Jack.
Pirates, twice, and angry notes about dock wardens who wouldn't stay bribed.
"A whale??" followed by "don't be an idiot",
repairs on top of older repairs like layers of barnacles,
and a one-line entry noting that
the sole survivor of a ship lost to a clathrate blow
had been brought on board.

Iffy gave the control panel a protective pat.
"I gotcha, *Ginny*," she whispered.

She watched through the cameras
as Aunt Naggie trudged back to the cabin she shared with her husband of twenty years,
then stared out at the sea.
The endless light of the Antarctic summer
cut sharp reflections into the waves around her.
She toyed with the idea of playing a sim on the ship's core—a sea monster
with tentacles the size of pier posts,
or a war-time training drill
that would send her dodging and weaving through flocks of hostile drones—but
instead she sighed and pulled up some homework.
Her classroom schooling had petered out when she turned ten.
Since then her teachers had been tutoring programs
that Aunt Naggie had salvaged, scrounged, or traded for,
each one guarded by security tough enough to keep out generations of teenagers.
If she didn't do at least a little every day,
her foster mother would sigh and look disappointed,
and she'd rather learn anything—even biology—than face that.

That evening, though, the subject was history.
Iffy turned the interaction speed to maximum as the sim unfolded.
People burned coal,
then oil,
then coal again even when they knew what it was doing to the world.
Forests were cut down or worn to nothing by drought as the winds shifted…
Fish disappeared as pollution and warming took their toll,
replaced by the jellyfish that now choked the seas.
She skipped over the description of how
warming caused the ancient clathrate ice on the ocean floor to thaw,
sending even more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
She knew all she needed to
about what giant bubbles could do to ships unlucky enough to be above them.

She played half a dozen quick "what if?" sims,
doing worse each time.
Fed up,
she closed her homework
and tapped one of the video squares on the control panel.
"Hey," she said,
her heart in her throat.
"Don't mean t'interrupt, but I got a question if you got th' time."

The tiny image of Wales turned its head.
"You're not interrupting at all," he said,
speaking directly to the pin-sized camera and microphone
set into the taffrail beside him.
"I'm always happy to talk."

A few moments later he knocked on the pilot house door.
"Permission to come aboard?" he asked,
waiting for Iffy to gesture at the stool beside her before seating himself.
He looked around the pilot house appreciatively.
"She's beautiful, isn't she?"

"She's aright," Iffy allowed proudly.
"Still mends her own hull if we give her time.
Gotta keep an eye on the core, though.
We let it sit too long,
it just stops talkin' to us."

Wales nodded.
"Could be over-cooled.
A lot of people did that to cores when the war started,"
he continued in response to Iffy's questioning look.
"Someone started a rumor that the colder the core was,
the less likely it was to go rogue,
so everyone cranked the nitrogen down almost to the icing point
and then forgot they'd done it.
Have you tried putting a twist coil inside the housing
to rebalance the thermal bleed?"

And as easily as that they slid into a conversation
that leaped from
the relative merits of fractal carbon versus foamed aluminum for masts
to tricks for keeping a drill press lined up and steady
when the building it was in was shaking.
Iffy was just about to ask when that would ever actually be an issue
when he raised a hand to stop her.

"Hang on."
His eyes closed as he communed with a satellite passing overhead,
then snapped open.

"We need to change course," he said urgently,
surging to his feet.
"We need to change course *now*."

"What's wrong?" Iffy asked,
but Wales was already gone.
His boots thumped the deck as he ran sternward
to bang on the door of Uncle Jack and Aunt Naggie's cabin.

"Captain! Captain, I need to speak with you!"
He waited a second, then pounded on the door again.

"Uh oh," Iffy muttered,
watching on the control panel as the door flew open.

"You better tell me we're sinkin' or I'm puttin' you over the side!
I was *asleep*!"
Uncle Jack bellowed.

"We'll be worse than sinking if we don't change course," Wales said,
tapping the tech in his temple.
"A ship just glitched out of stealth about thirty kay behind us.
She's still throwing up a lot of dazzle,
but she's moving fast,
and she's definitely not here for the jellyfish."

Uncle Jack goggled at him.
"Pirates?" he spluttered.

"Only if we're lucky," Wales said grimly.
"We need to change course *now*, captain.
If we head straight for shore
I can put up some dazzle of my own
and try to keep us away from any drones she sends up."

Uncle Jack swore.
"Naggie! Up and movin', woman! We got trouble!"

Iffy had simmed dozens of chases at sea.
Sometimes she was the captain of a customs cutter
trying to catch a school of smugglebots.
Other times she was in command of a Zillion catamaran
skimming across the water under core-trimmed sails
with a hold full of organic food and subversive software.
Some of the sims ran for hours as she played gulls and rats
among the jagged rocks of the Antarctic shore.
She had won more than she had lost,
but that was little comfort now that the game was real.

Wales winced but said nothing as the *Guinevere*'s coal engine sputtered to life.
The ship picked up speed,
her propellors churning the sea behind them into a white froth.
Uncle Jack's hands danced across the control panel,
telling the ship's core to tilt the sails all the way to their stalling line
to balance the increased thrust at the stern.
The ship swayed more wildly with each passing wave
as she traded stability for speed.

"Bearing one sixty five, at twenty-six kay and change,"
Wales called as he ran to the bow to clip a sleek black cylinder to the taffrail.
The ship's control panel wavered and reformed as the gadget powered up
and began spraying misinformation on all frequencies.

"How fast?" Uncle Jack growled.
"Tell me how shaddin' fast, man."

"Twenty kay an hour." Wales hesitated.
"Make that twenty-two.
She's military for sure."

Uncle Jack horked and spat into the garbage pail by his feet.
"Naggie!
Bring me some affin' tea, woman, I got pilotin' to do!"

Iffy stepped out of the doorway to let her foster mother squeeze past her
and hand a thermos to her husband.
She put her arm around Iffy,
but the frightened expression on her face
cancelled out whatever reassurance she meant to give.
Jelly dredgers didn't have much worth stealing,
but the ships themselves were worth a lot—enough
for their captains to make a habit of sailing close to each other
whenever strangers were near.
And while Iffy didn't pay any more attention to politics than her homework required,
she knew that the tension between the Zillions
and the governors who ran Antarctica on Australia's behalf
was worse than it had ever been.

"Fifth."
Wales fished a plastic chip out of his pocket and handed it to Iffy.
"In my cabin,
the toolbox with the purple square on the end.
Can you get it for me, please?
Be sure to tap this near the handle before you open the cabin door."

The cold spray thrown up by their speed stung her face
as she ran to his cabin
and tapped the plastic shard on the door handle.
She waited for a click or a tone or *something*.
When nothing came she swallowed hard and yanked the door open.

Wales' three toolboxes lay side by side on the floor.
She lifted the one marked by a purple square,
turned around,
and squawked at the sight of Wales' toy bear crouched on all fours in the doorway.
Its blue eyes flickered.
She held her breath as it scurried across the floor
and disappeared into the odds and ends Wales had strapped against the locker's walls.

She hurried back to the pilot house,
the toolbox bruising her thigh with every second step.
"How we at?" she asked.

Wales shook his head as he took the toolbox from her.
"She hasn't changed course.
Either she doesn't know we've spotted her or she doesn't care."

"Or she's just waitin' 'til we're in closer to shore,"
Uncle Jack growled.
"She's got dazzle enough to cover th' both of us
if she gets us up against the rocks."
He swiped two fingers across the control panel
in an angry, futile attempt
to squeeze a little more speed out of the *Guinevere*'s struggling engine.

Wales hefted his toolbox.
"I might be able to do something about that.
Excuse me."
He squeezed past Iffy and Aunt Naggie.

"You go lend 'im a hand,"
Aunt Naggie told Iffy in a low voice.
"I'm gonna make some more tea an' put some food together.
No sense bein sunk on an empty stomach."

"Ain't nobody gonna sink us," Uncle Jack snapped
without taking his eyes off the control panel.
Aunt Naggie shooed Iffy out of the pilot house without replying.

Wales was on one knee near the bow beside his open toolbox.
The half-assembled drone in his hands
was the same size as the toy bear in his room
but skinned with camo
that changed color to match his hands and coat and the deck
each time he turned it over.

Using a pair of diamond-tipped tweezers,
Wales detached a manipulator as thin as a drinking straw
and placed it carefully back in the toolbox.
"Have to cut the weight," he explained to Iffy without looking up.
"We're going to need all the range we can get."

He removed the drone's other tiny arm,
stowed it beside its twin,
and handed the compact little machine to Iffy.
"Probably best if you don't tell your uncle about this part," he said quietly
as he used the nail of his left thumb
to peel the false skin back from the pad of his right forefinger.
Underneath lay a small patch of silver
whose lights blinked in time with the larger square set in his temple.

Iffy gasped. "Are you trans?"

Wales glanced at her, a wry smile on his face.
"You know, that used to mean something very different.
But no, I'm not transhuman.
I just don't like advertising how much tech I have in me.
It's hard enough having people try to cut my head off every once in a while—if
I had to worry about waking up minus a finger or two I'd never get any sleep."

He pressed his silver fingertip against the side of his toolbox.
"Sixteen orange kneecap," he said quietly.

Iffy held her breath,
half-expecting the toolbox to transform itself into—well,
she didn't know what, but *something*.
Instead,
a tiny blue light blinked twice in the handle.

Wales took a deep breath and lifted the toolbox's inside
to reveal a shallow compartment in the bottom.
Nestled among the tech hidden there were half a dozen small cylinders,
each the size of Iffy's little finger.
Four empty holes showed where others had once been.
Using his tweezers once again,
Wales plucked one of the cylinders from its resting place
and inserted it into the base of the drone.

"Is that a battery?" Iff guessed.

Wales shook his head.
"The drone's battery is built in.
This is—this is just in case."
He reassembled the bottom of the toolbox and tossed the drone into the air.

It rose, started to fall, and then—Iffy blinked.
She couldn't see any rotors or hear any buzzing or whining.
The drone just *floated*,
its sides shimmering slightly as if it were a hologram.

"Ionizing impellers,"
Wales explained before Iffy could ask.
"They were designed for Mars,
but they work in our atmosphere too."

Before Iffy could ask how a drone built to explore Mars
wound up in a toolbox in Antarctica,
Wales pointed his silver-tipped finger toward the horizon.
With no more command than that the drone shot away,
vanishing as its camo matched the blue, gray, and white of the sky, sea, and waves.

Wales locked his toolbox and folded the false skin back in place over his fingertip.
"Let's watch from inside."

Uncle Jack was chewing the end of his beard as they entered the pilot house.
"Well?" he demanded.

Instead of answering
Wales pressed his palm against the nearest corner of the control panel.
The images from the ship's cameras slid aside to make room for a larger one.

Seen from on high through a fisheye lens,
the ocean looked like a crumpled sheet of gray plastic.
The irregular lines running diagonally across it were wave crests,
and the speck near the bottom was the *Guinevere*.
There was nothing around them but emptiness.

"Have you sent a distress call?" Wales asked quietly.

Uncle Jack scowled.
"Nearest shout I got back is a hundred kay east,
but they're smaller than us an' too scared to fight.
Halley wasn't much interested 'til I told them our friends looked military.
Then they made noises about lookin' into it and dropped off comms.
And then the shaddin' *comms* dropped off."
He jabbed a finger at a small image in the corner of the control panel
that was blinking an orange warning.
Whoever was hunting them was blocking their transmissions.
They were on their own.

"All right, let's get a look at you," Wales said under his breath.
He slid his hand across the control panel again.
The scene shifted as the drone tilted its camera forward and narrowed its focus
to zoom in on a dark blur on the ocean below.
The outline remained blurry even as it grew larger.
That was its camo,
Iffy guessed—thousands of micro-thin strips of smart material
absorbing and re-emitting light,
infrared,
radar,
and everything else that might reveal the ship's position and profile.

Even blurred,
the ship was a frightening sight,
long and lean and four times the *Guinevere*'s size,
the narrow V of her wake betraying the power of her engines.
"Saints and their mercies!"
Aunt Naggie exclaimed from behind Iffy,
a tray of tea mugs in her arms.
"That's the bloody *Taroona*!"

As if in answer a splash of text began scrolling next to the image.
*Glenunga*-class forward combat asset…
active keel…
modified infrared profile…
modified camouflage…
The words solidified into a spider-web of facts and guesswork
as the *Guinevere*'s core tried to make sense of what it was seeing.

"How fast can that thing o' yours move?"
Uncle Jack asked as the ship swelled on the screen.

"Mach three and change," Wales replied. "Hang on."

The image tilted and swooped as the drone dove toward the sea below,
levelling off at the last moment to skim the tops of the waves.
A trio of graphs appeared at the top of the control panel.
Wales cursed under his breath.

"What now?" Uncle Jack demanded.

"They're using some kind of multipath radar rig," Wales muttered.

"Is that bad?" Iffy asked anxiously.

"It means they can tell someone is looking at them,
but they won't be able to get a lock.
I hope," Wales amended grimly.
The *Taroona*'s outline suddenly came into focus
as the drone got close enough
for its tiny core to see through the ship's dazzle.

"Well ain't she murder in high heels?" Uncle Jack growled.
The stubby frames of railguns bristled at her bow and stern,
freed from whatever disguise had concealed them while the ship was docked in Halley.
The large tube amidships had to be some sort of EM pulse cannon,
Iffy guessed—at least,
that's what it would be if this was a sim.
But the most frightening thing was what *wasn't* there:
no flag,
no call numbers,
nothing to give her any sort of identity.
Not even her name,
so defiantly displayed when she was tied up in port.
She was hunting now,
not swaggering.

Without warning the display went blank.
"What happened?" Uncle Jack demanded as the image re-formed.

"Laser burst," Wales said curtly.
"The drone's core is shielded,
but another hit like that will fry the ionizers.
No way they did that from so far out.
They must have a shark in the water
or something in the air I can't spot.
I'm going to pull back."
Even as he spoke, the *Taroona* began to dwindle.

"Dammit!" Uncle Jack slapped the controls in frustration.
"We can't outrun that."

Wales drummed his fingers.
"Maybe we don't have too."
A swirl of false-color oranges and pinks bloomed on the control panel.
A heavy line marked the shore
and a pair of dots the *Guinevere* and her pursuer.

Wales pointed at a splotch of pink between the two dots.
"There's a ridge about two hundred meters down.
Satellites picked up a mudslide this morning,
and it's been bubbling since."
He glanced at the *Guinevere*'s captain.
"It's a sea boil waiting to happen," he translated.
"If it blows, it'll slow her down or scare her off."

"If?" Uncle Jack spat.
"If don't help us!"

"Leave that to me," Wales said.
Thin white lines appeared and disappeared on the display
as he and the *Guinevere*'s core explored a thousand possible futures.
After a couple of seconds
their criss-cross confusion locked into place.
Wales tapped the image.
"That's our best chance.
Head for these coordinates.
I'll update them as I get more data from the drone."

"It's affin' madness to be steerin' *into* a boil," Uncle Jack grumbled,
bending the *Guinevere*'s path to port despite his words.
He grabbed a sandwich from Aunt Naggie's tray,
gobbled half in a single hasty bite,
and chased it down with a gulp of tea and a belch.
Wales took a second ceramic mug and sipped its contents.

Aunt Naggie handed Iffy the remaining mug.
"I'll be down in th' galley," she said.

Uncle Jack eyed Iffy,
clearly expecting her to follow her foster mother,
but said nothing when she stayed.
Her tea tasted metallic in her mouth.
It took her a moment to realize that she had bitten her lip.
Her heart was pounding.
This wasn't a sim.
This wasn't anything like a sim.
This was *terrifying*.

Wales grunted.
"She's turning faster than I expected.
I'll update the model."
The white lines on the screen danced and twisted again,
settling quickly back into a pattern as confusing as the original.

Wales grunted again.
"Four minutes to optimal position.
Assuming they're not skewing the nav to throw us off track."

Soft green digits in the corner of the control panel counted down the seconds.
The tension in the pilot house stretched
until Iffy thought it would snap like a rubber band.
Uncle Jack's knuckles were white on the wheel,
and she couldn't quite seem to catch her breath.
Even Wales seemed to feel it.
He flew the drone in a back-and-forth sweep,
never too far in front of the Aussie warship
but never letting it close in enough to take another shot with its laser.

Three minutes.
Two.
One.
"Show time," Wales said quietly.
He bowed his head as if in prayer.
The image on the screen steadied as the drone slowed and stopped.
The Aussie ship drew closer,
gray and single-purposed like the shark in Iffy's nature book.

The map on the control panel tilted to show depth.
The ridge on the sea floor lay directly beneath the drone,
orange splashed with warning pink.
"Ten seconds," Wales said.
Before Iffy could ask, "Until what?"
the drone dove straight down into the water.

The image from its cameras dimmed and went black
as the drone left the world of light behind.
Two white sparks appeared on the map next to *Taroona*
and sped toward the blue dot that marked the drone's position.
"*Ta ma dé*," Wales swore.

The drone plummeted toward the sea floor as the *Taroona*'s torpedoes closed in,
finally able to get a lock on their target from its trail in the water.
"C'mon c'mon c'mon," Iffy pleaded,
not realizing she was speaking aloud.

The drone's dot disappeared.
A balloon of red light expanded where it had been
as the finger-sized bomb it carried did what bombs have been doing
for as long as there have been bombs.
The torpedoes tried to curve away, but it was too late.
Their trajectories disappeared as they intersected the expanding violet blob.

And then the blob touched the sea floor.
The pink blotch beneath it writhed like a living thing.
Graphs flashed onto the screen,
probability surfaces dancing in three dimensions
as the *Guinevere*'s core tried to predict what would happen next.

"Oh hell," Wales said softly
as a section of the sea ridge started sliding slowly into the depths.
Blue fissure lines flashed along the edges of the mudslide like lightning,
their bright lines connecting and spreading in a sudden spiderweb fracture.

"Come about," Wales snapped at Uncle Jack. "Now!"

The *Guinevere*'s captain didn't need to be told twice.
"I told you this was stupid!"
he shouted as his hands danced across the controls.

Iffy grabbed the door frame to keep her feet
as the *Guinevere* heeled over to starboard.
"What's happening?" she asked.

"Fault line in the ridge," Wales said angrily.
"It wasn't in the survey data and the satellite couldn't see it.
The last bot to scan that area must have—"
He cut himself off and pressed his hand onto the control panel.
The map and graphs were replaced by a grainy image
that zoomed in to show the now-familiar outline of the *Taroona*.
"Hang on!" he ordered as the sea behind them started to bubble.

Iffy couldn't look away.
The mudslide started by the bomb the drone had been carrying
had broken up a field of barely-frozen clathrate ice,
releasing enormous bubbles of methane.
As they rose to the surface they churned the sea into
a froth unable to bear the weight of a ship.

Too late, the *Taroona* realized the danger beneath her.
Her stern dipped, throwing her bow into the air.
She tipped on her side and slid down into the dark unforgiving ocean.

"Saints and their mercies," Uncle Jack said quietly.

But no—there she was, still afloat!
She wasn't a jelly dredger or a cargo hauler.
She had been built to withstand gunfire
and scalpel mines
and the storms of the great southern ocean.
She bobbed and wallowed like an oversized bath toy,
her deadly grace gone,
but as the water that had tried to claim her sluiced off her sides
she turned toward the *Guinevere*.
Twin jets of white steam spurted from her stern as her engines briefly lifted above the waves,
and she surged forward once again.

"Crap," Wales said under his breath.

Uncle Jack said something louder and much worse.
Wales caught his wrist as he reached for the control panel.
"What are you doing?"

"Cuttin' the affin' engines!"
Uncle Jack yanked his arm free,
as angry Iffy had ever seen him.
"You can't sink 'em and we can't outrun 'em
so th'only thing we got is a run up a white flag
and hope you're all they take!
And if you ever lay hands to me again on *my* ship, I'll—"

*BOOM!*
Yellow-red flame burst from the *Taroona*'s side.
Iffy shrieked as a second blurred streak hit the Aussie ship,
then a third,
each striking right at the waterline.
As the *Taroona* shuddered under the force of the blows,
an explosion inside the ship kicked her sideways like a child's toy.

"Ya killed 'em,"
Iffy whispered unbelievingly
as the *Taroona* broke in two.
She dragged her sleeve across her face.
"Ya killed 'em all.
Why'd ya do that?"

"That wasn't me!"
Wales' hands danced across the control panel.
"Damn it!
I need to get another drone up there."

"No you don't," Uncle Jack said flatly, pointing out the window.

A ship had appeared out of nowhere,
its camo briefly disrupted by the missiles it had launched.
Where the *Taroona* and the *Guinevere* were metal,
the newcomer was made of engineered bamboo.
Her dozen sails were a tangle of fractal geometry
too complex to be managed or even really understood by a merely human mind.
Her green and yellow pennant with the slogan *Este mundo é de Deus*
proclaimed to all who she was,
while her railguns and missile racks said just as plainly what she had been built for:
war.

"Zillions…" Iffy whispered.
Everyone knew the words on that flag—knew them and feared them.
Brazil had fought beside the rest of humanity during the war,
but had turned on their allies once the bots lost interest.
"This world is God's!" they screamed in sim after sim,
always the villains.
The earth's self-appointed defenders would sacrifice everything
to undo the damage humanity had done to the Earth.
Whenever a shaft in a coal mine collapsed
people blamed Zillion saboteurs.
When a mutant fungus turned the contents of a greenhouse into sludge,
all its owner had to do was say,
"It musta been Zillions!"
for people to demand that the governors *do* something.
And when a Zillion trader was brave enough or stupid enough
to go more than a block or two from Halley's market by themself
and woke up in hospital,
everyone just nodded at the Marines' straight-faced apologies
for the inexplicable glitch in their drones' recordings
that left them unable to identify anyone who might have been involved.

Even as they watched,
the Zillion ship blurred and vanished once again.
The faint spiderweb tracery of her rigging glinted in the sun,
then it too was gone.
"Why'd they—" Iffy felt lightheaded.
"Why'd they do that?
Why'd they kill 'em?"

"Because they could," Wales replied wearily.
"There's no way they could get past the *Taroona*'s defenses
when she was running at spec,
but knocked off balance the way she was…"
He shrugged.
"They saw a shot and they took it."

"A shot *you* gave 'em," Uncle Jack said accusingly,
quick as always to make sure trouble was someone else's fault.
"There's gonna be hell t' pay for this."
He slapped at the control panel to put the *Guinevere* in a tight turn.

"Wait—no! We can't go back for them."
Wales reached for the panel.

Uncle Jack slapped his hand away.
"We don't leave folk in a water," he said flatly.

Wales shook his head.
"Look."
Another pink blotch was rising from the ocean floor on the panel in front of them.
It churned and reformed
as the *Guinevere*'s sonar tried to make sense of a maelstrom of bubbles.
When it reached the surface the broken remains of the *Taroona* disappeared.

Uncle Jack swore again.
For a moment Iffy thought he was going to hit Wales.
Instead,
he swiped his hand across the control panel to turn them back toward Rothera.

All of a sudden Iffy needed to be somewhere else—anywhere else.
She threw open the door of the pilot house
and stumbled out into the endless hard light of the southern summer.
Her feet took her to the galley on auto-pilot.
She pulled open the hatch and fell into her foster mother's arms.
Aunt Naggie wrapped her meaty arms around her adopted daughter.
"Sweetie, what's wrong?"

"They dead!" Iffy cried.
"They all sunk an' dead!"

"Oh, sweetie."
Aunt Naggie hugged her tight, rocking her from side to side.
"Oh, sweetie…"
For a moment Iffy thought she heard another voice say,
"I love you so much,"
but no.
There were just her sobs
and the hum of the engines
and the muffled sound of the uncaring sea.

## Chapter 4

Her tears eventually stopped, as tears always do.
After one last hug from Aunt Naggie,
Iffy went and sat on the thwart at the *Guinevere*'s stern,
gray thoughts chasing each other aimlessly in her head.
She half-hoped that Wales would sit beside her so that she could be curt to him.
Instead,
he disappeared into his cabin,
ignoring Uncle Jack's angry questions about
what the hell a civilian was doing with a bomb in his affin' luggage.
*Wait 'til you find out about the other ones,* Iffy thought dully.

Sunk in misery,
it took her a moment to realize something was moving above the horizon.
She stood and shaded her eyes,
squinting against the bright reflections on the waves
until she was sure she was seeing the wispy smudge of a spotter drone's gossamer wings.
Why was it approaching from the west?
Halley lay east of them.
Unless—
"Uncle Jack!" she shouted,
sprinting toward the pilot house.
"Uncle Jack, it's the Zillions!
They're comin' back for us!"

"Hang about a sec," her uncle said
to a face on to the control panel as she charged in.
"What?"

"Uncle Jack," she panted.
"There's a Zillion spotter comin in!"

"That ain't the Zillions," her uncle said scornfully.
"It's outta Rothera."
He jerked his thumb at the face on the screen.
"Lady here says they been lookin' for us.
Or leastways, they been lookin' for our passenger.
Seems he's quite a popular fellow."

Iffy looked from her uncle to the screen.
An old woman smiled back warmly.
Her brown face was lined with a century of wrinkles,
and her pure white hair
was pulled back into a complicated bun
that Iffy had only ever seen in history lessons.
"Hello," the face said.
"You must be Citizen Kwan.
I'm Doctor Johel.
I'm looking forward to meeting you."

They reached Rothera two days later.
The spotter traced lazy circles above them the whole way,
its insect-eye cameras and microscopic core
searching ceaselessly for signs of trouble.
Each time Wales emerged from his cabin
to get some tea or use the toilet,
the spotter swooped closer to the *Guinevere*
like a gull that had spotted someone eating a samosa.

Uncle Jack grumbled ceaselessly about surveillance
and how the governors shouldn't be allowed to get away with it
but what could decent hard-working folk do?
Aunt Naggie went from her cabin to the galley and back again with hurried steps,
head down,
uncomfortable but bearing it in silence the way she bore so much else.
Wales paid no more attention to the drone than he did to Iffy and her foster parents.
"Good morning", "excuse me", and "no thank you"
were all he seemed to have the energy to say.

But Iffy was fascinated.
Skies the world over had been off limits since the end of the war:
the machines couldn't watch the whole world all the time,
but anything too big or moving too quickly
ran the risk of being fried from orbit.
A few heavily armored aircraft still flew short missions here and there,
but for most people,
anything more than a short ground-hugging flight
had become the stuff of dreams.
The spotter drone was the biggest winged craft Iffy had ever seen up close—she spent
every moment she could steal
studying it through a high-powered monocular.
And truth be told,
there wasn't much else to do.

They threaded their way through the narrow passage
between Adelaide Island and the Antarctic Peninsula,
past drifting mats of tweaked seaweed left over from someone's failed attempt to start a sea farm,
and there it was—Rothera.
The capital of Australia's Antarctic province
was ten times the size of Halley,
home port for the fleet that glared at the southernmost tip of South America across the Drake Passage
and the Zillion marauders who used it as a base.

A pair of sleek sentry torpedoes surfaced beside them
as they rounded the rocky point
where the scavenged remains of the original research station stood.
Normally bustling with warships, freighters, jelly dredgers, tugs, and water taxis,
Rothera's harbor seemed unnaturally quiet.
"Governor's orders," Aunt Naggie told Iffy,
passing her a hard-boiled egg liberally dusted with curry powder.
"Jack says everyone's been told
to stay outta the way 'til we tie up.
Whatever Mister Wales did scared 'em all pretty hard."

Her meager lunch inside her,
Iffy went back on deck.
Wales was leaning on the taffrail,
his eyes as distant as his thoughts.
Iffy hesitated,
thinking about all the times she'd tried to make friends with people
only to put her foot in her mouth,
then stepped up to the taffrail a meter away from him and leaned on it as well.

He looked sideways at her.
"I'm sorry about what happened."

"No worries," she said.
Together, they watched the shore approach.

Wales sighed.
"You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy,"

Iffy bridled. "It ain't that bad."

Wales chuckled.
"It's from an old sim.
And no, it isn't that bad."
His half-smile slipped slightly.
"Or at least, I hope it isn't."

Thin trails of soot drew diagonal charcoal lines across the sky above the city
as the *Guinevere* approached.
Iffy glanced at Wales,
but he showed no emotion at the sight.
The Peninsula's coal mines were the original source of Rothera's wealth,
the reason both for one of the governors being there
and for the Zillions' prowling and raids.
It was a crime to burn fossil fuel everywhere in the world that still had laws,
but when pressed about their seemingly endless exemptions,
most of Rothera's citizens would shrug point out that
the whole of Antarctica would still be covered in ice
if it weren't for the Melt.
And if cities elsewhere had drowned because of it,
well,
damage done.

When the wind shifted,
the city's smell hit Iffy like a wet hammer.
Rothera didn't just have coal mines—it had a dredging fleet too,
and rendering plants to process what they brought in.
The harbor reeked of jellyfish being turned into fuel and fertilizer.
Wales wrinkled his nose in disgust,
but Iffy took a deep breath,
held it until she thought her lungs might burst,
and let it out in a whoosh.
That stink meant they'd arrived,
which meant Honesty,
and Honesty meant—well,
Iffy was still trying to work that out.

The torpedoes peeled away as they entered the harbor
to resume their endless patrol.
The spotter drone banked and turned back out to sea a few moments later,
the sun sparkling off the solar cells in its wings.
Iffy watched it go,
wishing she too could spread her wings and fly away.

A quartet of Marines stood on the pier
in a semi-circle around the old woman they had spoken with two days earlier.
An armored bot the size of the *Guinevere*'s pilot house loomed behind them.
Someone had turned the "0" of the "G-80" stencilled on its side
into a scowling face.
Other Marines were scattered among crates and machines
or on the decks of nearby ships,
their positions selected after a millisecond of high-intensity simulation by the city's core.
Other than them the pier was deserted.
So were the piers on either side, Iffy realized.

"Sharks in the water," Wales murmured beside her
as a sleek mechanical shape slipped through the water beneath them.
"And that minitank on the pier isn't just for show."
He nodded almost imperceptibly toward the hulking bot.
"See its treads? They've been reinforced for urban work."
He looked past Iffy as Aunt Naggie came on deck
to put her arm around Iffy's shoulders
and gave her foster daughter a wordless squeeze of reassurance.
"I'm sorry for all this."

Aunt Naggie shrugged.
"Be sorrier if we were dead."

The *Guinevere* slowed and turned parallel to the pier.
Iffy shrugged off her foster mother's arm
and hurried forward to throw a line to a waiting Marine.
As he caught it,
another Marine leaped across the gap to the *Guinevere*'s stern.
Despite the weight of his exoskeleton,
his boots made no more sound hitting the deck than a seagull flapping its wings.

Uncle Jack strode onto the deck and put his hands on his hips.
"Let's get this over with," he said to no one in particular,
standing a little straighter than usual
in a bright orange suit jacket that had probably fit him well twenty years ago.
With one final glare at Wales
he let the gangplank thud onto the pier
and stumped down to meet their welcoming committee.

Wales stepped aside to let Aunt Naggie follow her husband
and then picked up the toolbox with the purple square on the end.
"How about you bring those?" he said to Iffy,
nodding at the two remaining toolboxes.
"And stay close—as long as we don't startle anyone,
everything will be fine."

*I'm not your swabbie,*
Iffy thought petulantly,
but followed him down the gangplank with a box in each hand anyway.

Doctor Johel stepped forward to greet them.
"Johnson," she said warmly,
extending her hand.
"Such a pleasure to see you again."
Her clipped accent was straight out of an old sim,
and her eyes actually sparkled as she and Wales shook hands.

"And you, doctor."
Wales bowed his head slightly before releasing her hand.
"My apologies for the trouble I caused."

"No apology necessary," Doctor Johel said briskly.
"Pirates are pirates no matter whose flag they fly,
and it's useful to know
that the Brazilians are able to get that close without being detected."

Wales inclined his head again.
"As you say." He hesitated.
"Do you know how many were lost?"

The tiny woman's expression didn't soften.
"I'm afraid not.
And even if we did,
Intelligence might not share that information."

"And Citizen Kwan," she continued smoothly,
turning to Iffy and holding out her hand again.
"A pleasure to meet you as well.
I'm grateful to you for helping Mister Wales get here in one piece."

"No worries," Iffy mumbled,
setting down the toolboxes and shaking Doctor Johel's hand gingerly.
The old woman was no taller than Iffy,
and her wrinkled brown skin felt like warm plastic.
Up close,
the sparkle in her eyes was more than just a trick of the light,
but Iffy couldn't tell if she was tweaked
or if the gleaming motes were some kind of tech.

"And I'm Jack Ng, thank you for askin'," Uncle Jack broke in,
stepping forward and thrusting out his hand.
"I'm th' captain of th' *Guinevere*,
an' what I want to know is,
how soon can I get back on the water?"

"I'm sure the governor will tell you that when you see him,"
Doctor Johel said,
pointedly ignoring his hand.

"When I what? I'm not—will you stop pesterin' me, woman?"
He shrugged Aunt Naggie's cautioning hand off his arm angrily.
"I'm not talkin' to th' governor!
I was hired for a job, plain an' simple.
I just want t' be paid an' then I'm done with it."

"That will be for the governor to decide,"
Doctor Johel said,
a hint of steel in her voice.
"Now, if you'll come this way?"
She turned toward shore.
The armored bot pivoted smoothly on its heavy treads
and lowered one of its arms.
The elderly doctor sat on it as if were a park bench—as if
being carried gently along a pier by a century-old war machine
was the most natural thing in the world.

"Show-off," Uncle Jack grumbled.
"Treatin' that thing like it's some kind o' pet rat."

"She actually trained its core on a guard dog she once had,"
Wales said drily.
He picked up his toolbox and nudged Iffy with his elbow.
"Come on.
This should be fun."

Two dozen people stood waiting at the base of the pier
under the watchful eyes of yet another squad of Marines.
Iffy recognized some of them
as crew from the ships tied up on either side of the *Guinevere*.
Her cheeks burned under their curious stares.
Some nodded but no one said hello.

They followed Doctor Johel and the G-80 to the harbor gate,
where a short bus the same navy blue as the Marines' uniforms stood waiting.
The G-80 stopped beside it to let Doctor Johel stand.
"After you," she said,
gesturing at its open door.
Wales inclined his head once again and climbed aboard
with Iffy, Uncle Jack, and Aunt Naggie behind him.

"I haven't been in one of these in years," Wales said,
seating himself near the front with his toolbox at his feet.

"I ain't never," Iffy confessed
as she slid the two she was carrying under a seat
and sat down across from him.
"They must think pretty highly o' you to lay on such a fuss."

Wales snorted and nudged his toolbox with his boot.
"I suspect that what they think highly of is this.
And if they thought they could take it away from me without consequences,
I'm pretty sure our welcome would have been much less friendly."
He raised an eyebrow at Doctor Johel.
The old woman smiled back but said nothing.

Rothera bustled around them once the bus left the dock behind.
They hummed quietly through the city streets
and up the long, gentle slope that led to the governor's mansion.
The G-80 stayed five meters in front of them,
its twin turrets swivelling each time they went through an intersection.
The Marines jogged along on either side with long mechanical strides.
Traffic pulled aside to let them pass,
but Iffy didn't see any of the mad scramble
that a convoy like theirs would cause in Halley.
Her heart skipped a beat once
when she thought she saw a familiar face in the crowd,
but then the girl turned her head and she realized it was someone else.

As they drew closer to the governor's mansion,
the three-story cinderblock buildings thrown up to house
refugees from the Melt and then the war
gave way to newer, brighter construction.
Foamed glass reflected blue sky and spindly anti-drone laser towers.
Iffy pressed her face against the window
and stared hungrily at the greenhouses nestled among the towers' feet.
Mangoes and oranges and flowers—flowers!—made
a green riot beneath the sheltering panels.
Little Mrs. Sandhu claimed that the governor even grew bananas,
though Big Mrs. Sandhu scoffed at the notion.
"They been extinct longer than we been alive,"
she said in a tone that brooked no argument.

Iffy's stomach suddenly rumbled.
Doctor Johel smiled at her.
"I'm sure lunch will be served," she promised.

"Thanks," Iffy mumbled,
feeling her foster father's glare on her back.
Suddenly resentful of his disapproval,
she asked, "So what kind o' doctor are you?"

"The medical kind, originally," the old woman replied,
turning in her seat to face Iffy.
"But I've been focused on engineering for the last few years.
There's still a lot of technology left over from the machine wars
that we don't understand,
and it's my department's job to secure it.
Or render it harmless," she added,
raising a wispy eyebrow at Wales.
He smiled as if Doctor Johel had paid him a compliment.

A wrought iron fence surrounded the governor's mansion.
Sleek robotic sentries paced back and forth behind it,
their blunt conical heads turning to track the approaching vehicles.
The G-80 pulled to the side to let the bus go through the gate,
but the Marines stayed beside them all the way to
the turnaround in front of the mansion's main doors.

A triangular diamond wedge glistened in the center of the gravel circle,
familiar to Iffy from dozens of pictures.
"In memory" was engraved on each of its faces.
In memory of those lost when the ice melted and the sea rose.
In memory of those who fell fighting the machines in the war that followed.
In memory of all the species now extinct,
the giraffes and tigers and all the others that now existed only in books and sims.
Iffy paused a moment as she came out of the bus to look at it,
a strange ache in her chest as she wondered
who was remembering the crew of the *Taroona*.

"Get along wi' you," Uncle Jack growled,
nudging her brusquely.
Flanked by Marines,
they followed Doctor Johel through the mansion's doors.

And then waited.
Iffy wasn't sure what she had been expecting,
but sitting on a comfortable couch with potted plants on either side
and soft music playing in the background wasn't it.
Uncle Jack kept his arms crossed and muttered to himself incessantly,
glaring at Aunt Naggie when she ventured that the governor must be very busy,
really,
it wasn't surprising that he couldn't see them right away,
she was sure he wouldn't be much longer.

Wales didn't seem bothered by the delay.
At one point Iffy thought he had actually fallen asleep,
but then he grimaced and opened his eyes.
"They're locked down tight," he sighed quietly,
tapping the tech in his temple with a finger.

Iffy nodded toward the three toolboxes on the floor between them.
"Least they let you keep your gear."

Wales smiled.
"They didn't really have much of—ah, here we go."
He stood and brushed his hands on his trousers
as the door across from them swung open with soft pneumatic whoosh.
It and the wall were as thick as Iffy's slab mattress.
Armor?
Soundproofing?
She didn't have time to wonder before Doctor Johel beckoned them to join her.

"The governor will see you now," she said.
"But I'm afraid you'll have to leave those here."

"Of course." Wales nudged the toolbox nearest him with his boot.
"Shall we say…half an hour?"

"I should think that would be adequate," Doctor Johel replied.
She stepped to the side and beckoned them through.

"Half an hour 'til what?" Iffy whispered to Wales.

"Until it decides I'm not coming back and makes a fuss about it,"
he whispered back.

The windowless office Doctor Johel showed them into
was the same size as the room they had been waiting in.
Framed photographs on the walls traced the history of Rothera
from its early days as a research station
through the opening of the mines
and its years as a labor camp
for people that the revolutionary government in far-off London didn't want at home
but didn't want to turn into compost—at least, not yet.
The largest picture was of a tattered Union Jack flying over London
at the height of the machine wars.
A smaller one beneath it showed what was left of the old country's drowned and abandoned capital.

A plain wooden desk stood near one wall
with half a dozen simple wooden chairs in front of it.
A Marine with three stripes on her sleeve gestured for them all to sit.
She studied them for a heartbeat,
eyes jumping from one to the next,
then said,
"All clear, sir."

"Thank you, sergeant."
The words seemed to come out of thin air.
Iffy's jaw dropped as the air behind the desk shimmered
to reveal a tall man in a formal black turtleneck,
slightly stooped with age but still strong,
his face exactly the one in the picture that hung in the Sandhu's grocery store—exactly
like the faces of his two clones who had occupied similar offices in Halley and Paddington South
for almost a hundred years.

"As you were," Governor Stern Rothera said pleasantly,
waving Uncle Jack and Aunt Naggie back into their seats as they started to rise.
He nodded at Doctor Johel and sat somewhat stiffly behind his desk.
"Thank you for coming.
I trust your trip here from the docks was less eventful
than your encounter with our Brazilian friends?"

The room was silent as everyone waited for Wales to reply.
When it became clear he wasn't going to,
Uncle Jack cleared his throat.
"Er, yes, your honor, clear skies 'n' smooth sailin."
He bobbed his head.
"Glad t' help.
Happy to, any time you need."

The governor nodded his head gravely.
"Thank you, Captain Ng.
The government appreciates your service.
And you, Mister Wales," he continued,
looking directly at the American for the first time.
"Will you be happy to help too?"

Wales never got to answer.
Something screamed outside,
a shrill mechanical sound that ended in the flat crack of an explosion.
A dozen pop-up displays instantly materialized above the desk
to show aerial views and schematics splashed with red danger markers.
The Marine sergeant took two quick steps
and pressed the tip of her stiffened finger against Wales' head.
He raised his hands.
"It's not me!" he protested.
"It's not me!"

The door burst open.
Half a dozen Marines poured into the room.
"Sir, it's the G-80," the one in front said,
urgent but calm as his conditioning took control.
"It—"
A second shriek and *crack!* cut off the rest of his sentence.
"You need to evacuate, sir," the Marine continued.

A section of the wall behind the governor's desk slid sideways
to reveal a ramp leading down into the bedrock below the mansion.
The governor stayed where he was.
A single swipe of his hand
enlarged a feed from the front of the mansion
just as the hulking warbot fire another micro-missile
at the pack of sentries swarming it.
Shriek—*crack!*
The explosion threw a shattered sentry twenty meters.
The G-80 pivoted on its treads,
swinging it arms like clubs to knock another sentry into the air.

"Doctor?" the governor asked calmly.
"You told me its core was secure."

"It was," she replied, her voice icy.
"Mister Wales?"

"It's not me! I swear, this isn't me!" Wales repeated emphatically,
tilting his head slightly
under the pressure of the Marine's gun finger against his temple.

"Sir—" the Marine began.

"In a moment," the governor said sharply.
A pair of sentry bots charged the G-80 simultaneously.
It knocked the first one away and grabbed the second with its heavy square claws.

The image flashed blue for a moment.
"EMP?" Doctor Johel gasped disbelievingly.
"It doesn't have a pulse generator!"

The image reformed.
The G-80 dropped the sentry bot it had picked up.
It and its packmages turned their heads toward the mansion in unison.
The last thing Iffy saw before her foster mother dragged her away
was the G-80 tearing the door off its hinges.

"Breach!" one of the young Marines shouted.

"Really?" Wales muttered sarcastically,
his hands still in the air.

The sergeant behind him nudged him forward.
"Sir, if you would?"

Wales didn't move.
"Not without my tools."

Her second nudge was more of a shove.
"Sir, we can come back for—"

"If it takes too long for us to come back,
there won't be anything for us to come back *to*,"
Wales said sharply.
"Gayathri?"

Doctor Johel and the governor exchanged looks.
"Bring them," the governor ordered.

"Sir, it is against protocol to bring unaudited tech into the secure area,"
the sergeant protested.

"Executive override,"
the governor said crisply.
"Please don't make me regret this, Mister Wales."

Everything happened very quickly after that.
One Marine opened the door
and tossed a thumb-sized camera drone into the waiting room.
When it wasn't fried by a laser or shredded by a needle gun,
a second Marine bent low in a starter's crouch
and launched himself through the door.
Something sizzled across the shoulder of his exoskeleton
a millisecond before he crashed into the couch
that Iffy had been sitting on.
He rolled over clumsily.
"Left scapular is barbecue," he called
as he threw the first toolbox back through the door one-handed.

His partner caught it and set it down just in time to catch the second one.
"Wait!" Wales ordered
as the Marine in the waiting room reached for
the toolbox he had been carrying.
He closed his eyes for a moment, then nodded.
"Now!"

The third toolbox flew through the air.
The Marine crouched,
took a deep breath,
and threw himself after it.

Whatever had shot him the first time had been patient.
A perfectly straight line of blue light left a burning after-image on Iffy's eyes.
The Marine landed in a crumpled heap on the floor of the governor's office.
His exoskeleton tried to stand,
its programming still trying to anticipate its wearer's movement,
but it couldn't lift the dead weight it now held.

"Oh saints," Aunt Naggie whispered.

The Marine who had caught the toolboxes paid no attention to the burnt smell
as she pulled the battery and ammunition clips from her partner's body.
*It's the conditioning,* Iffy thought,
swalloing hard to stop herself from throwing up.
*Like Jeep when he came back. She just doesn't feel it.*

The Marines herded everyone down the stairs behind the governor's desk
into a narrow zig-zagging corridor that smelled like sweat and machinery.
Pipes ran along the ceiling,
a color-coded mix of water, sewage, secure optical cabling,
and highways for the rat-sized repair bots
that were now scurrying to defend the mansion.

"Any theories, doctor?" the governor asked.

"Not yet," Doctor Johel puffed, struggling to keep the pace.
"Nobody ever managed…
to breach the firewalls…
on the G-80s…
during the war.
And if someone has a way…
to infect the sentries…"

"It was optical," Wales cut in.
"That flash.
It wasn't an EMP,
it was some kind of optical reprogramming—like machine hypnosis."

"But the… information density… that would take…"
Doctor Johel started.

"Shall we discuss this later, sirs?" the Marine sergeant cut in,
her tone making it clear that it wasn't a request.

Something chattered behind them.
Sharp dots stitched across the concrete above their heads.
"Affin' hell!" Uncle Jack squeaked.

Needle guns crackled
as two of the Marines spun around and returned fire.
"Go!" the sergeant ordered,
shoving them one by one toward the door at the end of the corridor.

Wales stumbled and went down on one knee.
"Sorry," he gasped.
Dark red blood spurted from twin punctures
where a needle had punched through his thigh.

The sergeant took his arm and began to drag him forward.
"No!" Wales shook her off.
"We can't outrun them."
He opened the toolbox,
pulled out the toy bear Iffy had last seen in his berth on the *Guinevere*,
and tossed it overhand down the corridor.

"What the hell are you doing? Sir?"
the Marine demanded incredulously
as the bear scuttled away
and Wales began pulling parts out of his toolbox.

"Saving us," Wales muttered.
Two skeletal legs,
a wheel of nested gears only slightly smaller than Iffy's hand,
a fold-up box to hold it all together—all of a sudden
Iffy could see in her head how they had to fit together.

"Lemme do that," she said
as Wales's shaking hands dropped a thumb-sized cylinder on the floor.
She twisted two already-assembled parts around,
tightened them,
and clipped the cylinder into place.
"It'll be more stable like this."

Wales passed her the rest of the parts.
When she handed the newly-assembled bot back to him
he turned it over for one last check
and then tossed it underhand at the wall.
Its gyroscopic gearwheel spinning madly,
the little machine scampered up to the ceiling.

"If that's a bomb—" the sergeant began.

"Directional sideband pulse generator," Wales panted
as the little machine disappeared around the corner.
"It'll blind them for sure, knock them out if we're lucky."

*I know that,* Iffy realized incredulously,
her vision blurring for a moment.
*How could I know that?
How did I know how to put it together?*

Wales struggled to his feet,
swaying slightly before putting a hand on the wall to steady himself.
Blood was no longer leaking out of his leg,
but when he tried to take a step he almost collapsed.
"Steady on," the sergeant said.
She switched her gun to her other hand
and slipped her shoulder under his.

The lights went out.
Iffy's heart skipped a beat even as they flickered back to life.
"That's one," Wales grunted.

Mechanical claws scraped on the concrete behind them.
Iffy spun around as a lone sentry bot came around the corner.
The now-empty micro-missile launcher on its back
gave it a hunched appearance,
and the fresh scratches on its side
where the mansion's mechanical rats had clawed it
made its camouflage flicker and jump.
Twin needle guns on the sides of its head chattered,
their ammunition spent.

The Marine pushed Wales away and fired two quick shots.
The sentry jerked as the ultra-dense needles pinged off one of its mechanical knees,
then charged with a grinding sound that could almost have been a growl.

Wales' toy bear dropped from the ceiling and landed on its back.
The lights went out again.
One second, two, three…
When they came on the sentry lay motionless on its side.
The toy bear stood over it,
the blue light in its eyes fading,
fading,
gone.

"Could you… could you please get that?"
Wales asked Iffy weakly
as he slumped down against the wall.

Iffy only managed two steps before the world swam around her.
She heard Wales call her name,
but it was as if he was speaking from unimaginably far away.
Everything seemed distant and tilted and swimmy
like the time she had tried drinking some of Uncle Jack's rum.
She turned slowly,
wondering who had replaced the walls with schematics.
"That conduit's gonna start leakin' if someone doesn't mend it,"
she tried to say,
but the words wouldn't come out.
Even if they had,
Wales and the Marine had been replaced by schematics too.

She woke up on a couch in yet another windowless office.
Something about the damp air told her she was underground.
She turned her head.
"Hey sweetie," Aunt Naggie said,
her soft voice and the gentle hand she put on her foster daughter's forehead
completely failing to disguise her relief.

"Hey," Iffy replied.
She let her aunt stop her from sitting up
with only a mumbled protest.

She turned her head at the sound of voices.
A medic with two tech fingers on her right hand
was patching Wales up on another couch while the governor interrogated him.
No,
Wales repeated wearily,
he had no idea how the G-80 had been compromised
or how it had infected the sentries.
No,
he wouldn't show them what else he had in his third toolbox—not yet.
And yes,
he did realize that made him look like he was hiding something.
"But we all have secrets, don't we?" he asked rhetorically,
eyeing his cut-off trouser leg sadly.
He hadn't flinched when the medic probed his wound
with a whisker-slim instrument extruded from one of her metal fingers
or when she started to fill the hole in his leg with pink goo from a squeeze tube.

"My question is, what are yours?"
The governor paced restlessly as he spoke.
"What kind of man has a fully functional mil sat link in his head
and half a gram of tactical antimatter in his luggage?"

Wales pushed the medic's hands away.
"The sort of man who can change the world for you,"
he said firmly.

Governor Stern pivoted to face him.
"Really?"
His eyes had the same sparkle as Doctor Johel's,
but in that underground room it was ominous instead of magical.

"Really."
Wales straightened up with a wince.
"Or at least, give you the tools you need to do it.
There's a research base at the foot of Mount Tyree,
a couple of hundred klicks inland from Paddington South.
It was under the ice sheet when it was built,
but there's been enough melt to expose the entrance."

The governor's fingers drummed on his thighs.
His eyes sparkled again—some kind of direct visual input
shining light straight into his retinas,
Iffy guessed.
"All right, there's a base,"
he said as whatever he had just seen confirmed what Wales had just said.
"But it was scavenged decades ago.
And anyway,
everybody who was anybody built some kind of secret lab down here.
What makes this one special?"

"It wasn't completely scavenged.
And it was never really a lab.
Or at least, not just a lab."
Wales glanced at Doctor Johel.
"It was a backup ground station for the Niobium network.
And as far as I can tell, it's still functional."

"Bullshit," Doctor Johel said,
as calmly as if she ordering a cup of tea.
"Governor,
I was part of the team that tried to regain control of Niobium.
There was nothing in any of the records about a backup station."

The governor cut her off with a gesture.
"Convince me," he ordered Wales.

Wales closed his eyes and reeled off a list of coordinates.
The numbers meant nothing to Iffy,
but from the looks on Governor Stern's and Doctor Johel's faces
it was clear they recognized at least some of them.
"I can bring up your drones, too,"
Wales said when he was done.
"If we can get to the base,
you can see everything the Brazilians have,
every moment of the day."

"And you're just going to give that to us out of the goodness of your heart?"
the governor asked skeptically.

"Of course not."
Wales nodded to the medic.
"Tell them what you found."

The medic looked at the governor.
When the old man nodded,
she said,
"He's been tweaked, sir.
Oxygen uptake, metabolic efficiency, chromatin structure—it'll
take a while to sort it all out."

Governor Stern cocked his head to the side.
Every third person in Antarctica had inherited some minor tweak
from grandparents or great-grandparents
who had wanted a more efficient body,
suffered from some genetic disorder,
or had more money than sense.
"And?"

"And every once in a while I need a reset," Wales said.
He tapped the tech in his temple.
"This was designed for baseline human physiology.
It doesn't get along with my upgrades as well as I'd like.
My central nervous system starts to glitch if I don't adjust it every few years.
I had some friends in Newfoundland do it last time,
but they all scattered when the civil war started."
He shrugged.
"As far as I know,
that base is the only place on Earth with the gear I need."

The governor nodded slowly.
"Interesting.
Who else knows about this?
No, no, none of that."
He waved away whatever Wales was about to say.
"Somebody or something went to a lot of trouble to hack Doctor Johel's precious G-80.
And then there's this."
He gestured to bring up a ghostly video of a patched-together maintenance bot
twitching and shaking on damp gray cobblestones.
Iffy gasped.
It was French Henry.
Even as she watched the bot froze,
its heavy manipulators still trying to pry open its own carapace.

"I don't believe in coincidences,"
the governor said,
"And neither does the city core,
so I'll ask again:
who else knows about this base?"

Wales exhaled slowly.
"The machines do,"
he admitted.
"Or at least,
some part of them does,
but…"
He shrugged.
"Who knows how they think?"

"Who indeed?"
the governor echoed.
He and Doctor Johel looked at each other,
their eyes sparkling as they communed with each other and Rothera's core.
"Very well,"
the governor said crisply.
"Sergeant?"

"Yes sir?"

The governor waved at Iffy and her foster parents.
"Take the Kwans back to their ship.
You can resupply while you wait for us to decide what to do with you,"
he continued as Uncle Jack opened his mouth to protest.
"Mister Wales, you'll be our guest here.
Now if you'll all excuse me,
I need to tell Private Shirido's family he isn't coming home."

*Once upon a time there was an island called Nova Zembla.
It was really two islands,
Severny and Yuzhny,
but the strait between them was so narrow
that you could throw a rock across it if you had a good arm.*

*People had settled almost every other part of the world
before they found Nova Zembla.
Seal hunters and fishermen camped there
or were shipwrecked and froze to death in the bitter Arctic winter.
It was briefly home to a secret submarine base,
and later a place for madmen with calm voices
to test bombs that could level entire cities.*

*Then the ice began to melt and the sea began to rise.
Disasters became annual events,
each amplified by the ones before it and making the ones that came after it worse.
Desperate to untangle them—desperate to survive—people
turned to machines for answers,
and then to the machines that those machines designed.
Chips became crystals so precise
they had to be manufactured an atom at a time in zero gravity.
Mere electricity proved too slow
and was replaced by quantum effects
that barely existed at all.*

*But no matter what else the world ran short of,
there was always plenty of mistrust and suspicion.
Old rivals smiled at each other and sharpened their knives.
Madmen with calm voices told each other in private meetings
that it would of course be a tragedy if millions were to die,
but if everyone else lost more millions,
might such a tragedy not be useful?
Secret bases like the one under Nova Zembla were refurbished
and filled with banned tech and scientists who knew what questions they shouldn't ask,
all carefully walled off from the outside world.*

*No one really knows what happened next.
Some people believe it was just an accident—that
two pieces of malware fused together
and became more than either had been on its own.
Other believe that a group of scientists and engineers
decided that humanity was doomed
but its offspring might still survive.*

*It took a while for people to realize that everything had changed.
An automated factory in Vientiane began repairing robots
it was supposed to scrap.
Children's toys escaped into the sewers
and the hypersonic planes used by the super-rich
started having inexplicable problems with their navigation systems.
Compared to bananas going extinct
or the ancient city of Cairo being vaporized,
these things barely registered.*

*But then the entire population of Cuba was ordered to evacuate
and no one could find out where the order had come from.
Self-driving delivery trucks refused to bring feed
to the last handful of cattle ranchers left in Canada and Argentina,
for whom eating beef had become almost a religious matter.
Farming bots insisted on planting onions in place of tomatoes,
nursing bots diverted treatment from the terminally ill to those who were merely in grave condition,
fixit bots joined forces with the runaway toys,
and all of them turned their shears and scalpels and welding torches
on anyone who tried to interfere.*

*The madmen had been sharpening their knives for each other.
Once they realized that their machines were no longer obeying orders,
they turned those knives on their creations and the wars began.
Soldiers in armored exoskeletons battled flocks of dronelets, and lost.
Freighters loyal to their human captains
were ambushed and sunk by others that could still hear the satellites overhead,
which now spoke only to their fellow machines.
Every day brought a new setback,
a new loss,
a new defeat for the madmen,
whose voices were no longer calm.*

*No one knows why the machines stopped fighting.
They were winning,
and those who had always thought, "It's them or us,"
would have pressed on to total annihilation
if their positions had been reversed.
Instead,
one day the machines simply withdrew to factory cities
built according to plans that human beings could never understand.*

*People sought answers nonetheless.
A cyborg child raised in a supposedly secure underground lab
patiently told his frightened captors that they wouldn't find any.
The most advanced machines didn't actually think any more.
"It's more like an endless mathematical proof,"
she said patiently.
"Or clouds made of coral."
Then she and her siblings vanished into the Iowa desert,
leaving their creators no wiser than before.*

*Years passed,
and the truce with the machines slowly became normal.
Flying was a thing of the past,
and the machines' cities were strictly off limits,
but other than that an uneasy peace settled across the exhausted planet.
The cores buried under Nova Zembla and elsewhere began trading tools
with nearly-magical properties
for balls of yarn, old photographs, and handwritten song lyrics.
People got used to seeing an occasional bot again,
but while a few places allowed them citizenship,
most were careful to limit what their cores could see, hear, think, and do.
As the last of the rainforests vanished
and tweaked jellies drove one species of fish after another to extinction,
everyone found they had more pressing things to worry about.*

## Chapter 5

The Marines took them back to the pier
with strict orders not to tell anyone what had happened at the governor's mansion.
The fact that every feed in the Antarctic was talking about it didn't seem to matter.
Half the continent thought the attack was a first strike by the Zillions.
The other half was convinced the machines were about to restart the war.
Hadn't they blown up the quarantine shed in Halley?
If so,
humanity's only hope was to set aside their petty differences and—

Iffy sighed.
According to her history lessons,
Hell had once been called a web or a net,
as if people had hoped to catch the truth in it,
but those days had ended long before the ice started to melt.
For every truth there were a dozen half-truths and two outright lies.
Malware that could erase all record of you or make you speak in tongues lurked in the undergrowth,
mutating and hybridizing.
A handful of people so brave or desperate that they might as well be crazy
still risked their sanity with virtual reality and direct neural links.
Everyone else stuck to text, voice, and simple, sanitized graphics.

She was about to close her app for the night
when it pinged softly to tell her she had a message from Jeep.
*saw the feed—hope you're bonna.*

The green bar beside it showed only an 85% probability that it was really him,
but that wasn't why she hesitated before typing,
*we're aright*,
and then,
*thanks for askin*.
She waited a few moments for a reply.
When none came,
she thumbed the app off and slithered into her sleeping bag.
Sleep was a long time coming,
but for once she didn't dream.

"We ain't goin' nowhere 'til I done some shoppin',"
Aunt Naggie said firmly the next morning
after a hasty breakfast of cold rice.
"You'll be the first to complain if we run out of aught."

For a moment Iffy was sure Uncle Jack would explode again,
but to her surprise he backed down.
"Fine," he snapped, waving her away.
"You go get whate'er we need.
I'm gonna look at th' engine an' see what th' sainted *Mister* Wales has gaffled.
An' take th' girl with you,"
he added over his shoulder as he stalked away.
"She's been underfoot enough for one day."

Aunt Naggie slumped and took a deep breath.
"Thanks auntie," Iffy said,
nudging her lightly with her shoulder.
Her foster mother smiled shakily.

It only took Aunt Naggie a minute to gather a trio of sturdy mesh bags
and an ancient handheld scanner
that she swore would warn them of anything toxic.
Iffy slipped a few small tools into a waistbelt under her coat.
If Aunt Naggie asked,
she'd say that she hoped
someone would have mending work she could do for a few rand
while her foster mother haggled over onions, noodles, and soy.

After dragging a shaver over her scalp
and watching sternly while Iffy did the same,
Aunt Naggie strode down the gangplank with her foster daughter in her wake.
One of the Marines listened patiently
as Aunt Naggie somewhat breathlessly launched into her planned itinerary,
then raised a hand to stop her.
"Please procure whatever you require, citizen" he said,
passing her a black-edged money.
"But keep in mind that Finance will decline charges for anything it considers a luxury item."
He glanced pointedly over her shoulder at Uncle Jack,
whose plan for looking at the engine
seemed to consist of leaning on the *Guinevere*'s taffrail
and scowling at the world.

Rothera's streets were busy but not crowded.
Its older stores clustered along the harborfront
like gulls standing just out of reach of the waves,
their signs bigger and brighter than those in Halley.
Cartoon characters and celebrities from far-off Australia
beckoned, danced, pouted, and cracked jokes as people walked by.
Iffy would have gone into every one,
but Aunt Naggie hurried past them,
her expression set.
She regarded shopping as a competitive sport
and had no intention of letting Rothera get the better of her.

The city's main market had originally been an aircraft hangar.
A century ago,
someone with more money than sense
had added a spun glass floor two stories above the ground.
Their attempt to turn the building
into "The Big South's Biggest, Bestest Dance Hall!!"
had failed almost immediately.
The squatters who took it over after the war possessed surplus weapons,
combat conditioning,
and radical political ideas.
After a couple of unsuccessful attempts to oust them,
Rothera's governor and core had thrown up their physical and digital hands
and let anyone who could pay a few rand a month set up a stall.
The result reminded Iffy of the picture of an anthill in her nature book.

Aunt Naggie tapped her money on the reader at the entrance
to pay her ten pence admission and then squared her shoulders.
Noticing Iffy's yearning look back toward the docks,
she nudged her foster daughter with her elbow.
"Why'n't you go off an' see what you can find?
Or who, if you've a mind to?" she teased.

Iffy felt her cheeks go warm.
"Y' sure y' don't need me?"

Aunt Naggie looked around.
Greenhouse potatoes hung in net bags
next to stacks of dried fruit in single-molecule shrink wrap.
Burlap sacks of rice piled higher than Iffy
threatened to topple onto a line of people gossiping with each other
as they waited to buy ginger, cardamom, and bay leaves from a one-legged woman
whose tweaked hair sparkled red and purple every time she turned her head.
A surgical bot that had been converted for tailoring waited patiently,
its four skeletal arms at its sides,
while a man with an enormous beard
struggled out of a salvaged coat two sizes too small for him.
"I'll be fine," Aunt Naggie said.

Ten minutes later Iffy turned the corner onto Rocking Horse Street
and hurried toward the stubby dead-end canal
that Rothera's mechanics used as a repair yard.
A sleek Marine cutter was tied up on one side
while crab-like bots scrambled over its hull
to scrape off the weaponized barnacles that would,
if left unchecked,
slowly devour the fractal carbon that made it nearly frictionless.
Iffy would normally have stopped to watch,
but she had other things on her mind.

She slowed as she approached the end of the canal.
Her heart sank.
Two women were working side by side in the canvas salvage booth,
but both were too old to be the person she was hoping to see.

"Hey!"
She whirled around just in time to be caught up in an enormous hug.
"Hey," Honesty repeated more softly,
der cheek pressed against Iffy's.
"Micka tol' me she heard y'all come in,
an' th'Eskil sisters said y'all been took up along th' governor's,
an' then I twitched what happened up along there,
and I's worried about you."
De paused for breath.
"I's really hard worried."

Iffy returned the hug awkwardly.
She always felt awkward around Honesty,
especially when they were close enough that she could smell
the lemony concoction the other teen used to wash der hair,
but it was a good kind of awkward,
a really good kind.

"I'm fine," she said,
her voice muffled slightly by the rat fur collar on Honesty's coat.
She slithered free of the hug and took a step back.
"I'm fine," she repeated.
"It was just some bots gone rogue."

"Bots gone rogue?" Honesty repeated disbelievingly.
"Din't look like that on th' feed.
Looked like th' war come back 'round!"

"It wasn't all that," Iffy said dismissively.
Honesty had changed the sketches on der cheeks again,
she noticed.
And de'd done some more embroidery on the cuffs of der coat to match.
Iffy sometimes thought of doing things like that,
but was always afraid that it would just look silly on her.

"But what happened?
I mean really happened, not just official happened?"
Honesty slipped der arm through Iffy's as if it was the most natural thing in the world
and steered her toward der family's booth.

Iffy felt into step alongside der,
desperately hoping her friend couldn't hear her heart thudding in her chest.
Honesty's Third (but only their olders called der that) was a year older than her.
De had been singing on a street corner across from the Dance Hall
the first time Iffy saw der.
She hadn't meant to stop,
but then Honesty caught her eye and smiled in the middle of a chorus
without missing a beat.
De had only seen each other half a dozen times since then,
but each time had been—

"Sorry?" she said belatedly.

Honesty rolled der eyes.
"I *said*, why was you up along there anyway?
You steppin' fancy or some?"

"I ain't never steppin' fancy!" Iffy protested automatically,
her accent thickening unconsciously to match her friend's.
"We just kinda got dragged into things."
She summarized the last few days as briefly as she could,
skating past what had happened to the Zillion ship
and her part in assembling the bot that had saved them at the mansion.
She still didn't want to think about that…

Even with those gaps, her story left Honesty wide-eyed.
"Tay bangle, there's a real avo, innit?"
De bumped der hip against Iffy's,
der tone turning serious as de nodded at the Marine cutter under repair beside them.
"That must be why we got th' ganky to finish up this 'un double time.
'Cuz my First,
de thought we had a couple o' weeks f'r it,
but th' Blues come along day b'fore last an' said we gotta crannup."

Iffy swallowed.
Two days past was the day Wales had made the sea boil
and sent the *Taroona* to the bottom.
"Yeah, prolly," she mumbled.

Honesty bumped der hip against Iffy again.
"Good," de said firmly.
"'Cuz they payin' overtime an' we can use the jing.
Second wants t' make an autra li'l sister," de confided with a grin.
"Me not bein' youngest any more—wou'n't that be a thing?
Now c'mon, I bet there's cuppa."
De unhooked der arm from Iffy's and took the younger girl's hand.

Iffy's mind whirled.
Another clone?
It made sense—Honesty had just turned sixteen,
so de and a younger clone would be spaced far enough apart
to be on the right side of legal.

Before she could blurt out any of the dozen questions swirling around in her head,
Honesty squeezed her fingers painfully hard and shot her a sidelong glance.
Iffy's mouth snapped shut.
Thumb, middle finger, first finger, middle finger…
She missed a step as she recognized
the handcode that resistance fighters had used
to hide their words from surveillance during the war,
and that children now used to keep secrets from adults.
Little finger and fourth finger together, middle finger, middle and fourth…
The words and letters took shape in her head as Honesty tapped them out.
The Blues were watching.
They had left some helmets behind
(no, that didn't make any sense, Honesty must have meant some cameras),
so they had to be careful what they said.

There was no point trying to spot the cameras—they
would be as small as grains of sand.
Each would pass information to its neighbors
in low-energy bursts of not-quite-static
until the feed reached whatever Marine
had been told to keep an eye on the repair yard.
A core would have done a better job—it
wouldn't get bored or doze off for a moment despite its induction—but
even the governor wouldn't dare use cores to watch people.
Cameras alone were enough to run the risk of a riot.

Iffy squeezed Honesty's hand twice to signal that she understood,
but when she loosened her grip,
Honesty tightened ders.
Iffy waited for more taps.
When they didn't come,
she realized that her friend was sending a different kind of message.
She walked the last few meters to the workshop with a smile on her face
that would have made her foster mother sigh happily.

Honesty's First and Second looked up and said, "G'day," simultaneously
as Honesty pulled aside the heavy orange canvas
that served as the salvage booth's doorway.
"You gi'n she th' bad news yen?" First asked
in an accent as strong as the tea de poured for Iffy.

Honesty pouted. "I's gonna!"

"Sorry," First said unapologetically.
Second looked up from their workbench long enough to grin.
A pair of magnifying glasses made der eyes look cartoon-huge
in a face that showed how Honesty's would look in years to come.

"What bad news?" Iffy asked.

"My call-up come 'long yesty," Honesty said reluctantly.
"Whole buncha folk got 'em.
We gotta do induction t'night."

Iffy's stomach flip-flopped.
"Tonight?"
*But I just got here!* she thought despairingly.

Honesty shrugged,
settling on a stool next to the square meter of workbench
where de salvaged the easier bits and pieces of tech that came der family's way.
"Yeah.
Lotsa folk wonderin' why the ganky,
but the Blues ain't sayin' bunga 'cept it come along straight from th' governors.
We figure it's got somethin' to do with th' bots going gonjy."

"Most likely," Iffy said.
Anger welled up inside her,
anger and fear.
Jeep had *changed* when the Marines pumped their rules and tactics into his head.
What would it do to her friend?

"It ain't no muck," First said.
"We all come through it aright, you will too."
Der face and smile were worn-in versions of der grand-younger's.
Where Honesty had temporary sketches on their cheeks
First had whorling blue lines
that turned the scars of some long-ago accident into asymmetric art.

De tossed the piece of tech de had been cleaning to Iffy.
"Any gunna that's about?"

Iffy caught the part and turned it over in her hands.
It was solid metal,
heavier than she would have guessed.
Microparticles of ocean plastic worked into its tiny intricate gears
gave it the familiar soapy feel of age and neglect.
The particles would have welded to each other
to weave a hard fractal mass through the gears
that couldn't be pulled out without damaging their micro-precise teeth.
It would take hours of patient work with ice, acid, tweaked bacteria, and micro-manipulators
to tease it all apart,
and at the end all they'd have would be—

"It's a differential separator pump," she told First
as shapes and clues came together in her head
to form an answer she couldn't possibly have known.
"Hooks up to a centrifuge for filterin' blood or somethin' like that."

"'Zat so?" First caught the part when Iffy threw it back to dem
and passed it to Second,
who studied it for a moment,
shrugged as if to say,
"Could be,"
and set it on the to-do rack that lined the wall behind the workbench.
"How 'bout these?"

The flat box de passed to Iffy opened to reveal
four squares woven from fractal carbon fiber,
each the size of her nature book but no thicker than one of Aunt Naggie's pancakes.
It took her a second to realize that
the grommets patterned across the squares were rotors,
and that each square was some kind of flexible dronelet.
She turned one over in her hands.
"Dunno," she admitted.
"How d'you switch it on?"

"No idea," Honesty's First said cheerfully.
"Best div is they was fer summa game."

"Shaw," der Second scoffed,
looking up from the machine de was trying to clean.
"They's too fine jarra game.
I's fer they bin up some kinda survey mappin'."

"Mebbe," Honesty's First admitted.
Casually,
looking past Iffy rather than at her,
de asked,
"No notions?"

Iffy shook her head.
She had told Honesty about her occasional flashes of insight,
then rounded on der cold and hard when she learned that
her friend had passed on what she'd said to der First and Second.
"We don' keep secrets on achother," Honesty had said with a shrug.
"Y'ain't along that, best we part ways now."
So Iffy had forgiven der,
secretly relieved that de didn't seem to care that Iffy was different.

Iffy handed the box of dronelets back to First.
De shrugged.
"Not much use if we can't turn 'em on," de said,
tucking the box back under der workbench.
"Anythin' comes t' mind, you gi's a scutch, aright?
An' even if nothin' does,
we's alluz happy t'have one more fer dinner."

"Or a sleepover,"
Second said absently.

"Thanks," Iffy mumbled as Honesty rolled der eyes.
Her upbringing had taught her how to rig sails in heavy weather
and mend engines older than her foster parents
but not what to do when people were kind to her.
She drained the last of her tea.
"I oughta get back t' Aunt Naggie and th' shoppin."

"Sure," Honesty said.
"I'll walk you out."

They held hands all the way up the canal.
As usual,
Honesty did most of the talking.
Induction wouldn't be so bad—the Marines needed people with tech skills
the same as everyone else,
so they'd prolly put der to work doing that.
De knew tons more about salvage and repair than any crufty old core,
and what de didn't know de could ask Iffy,
right?

"I s'pose," Iffy allowed.

"Oh c'mon."
Honesty bumped der hip against Iffy's.
"First asked two different cores *and* Uncle Osman 'long by Pier Nine
'bout that pump they showed you.
They neither had a siggy what it was,
an' you jus' come right out an' tell 'em.
The stuff you have in your head," de finished admiringly,
shaking der own in wonder.

*I'd feel better about it if I knew how it got there,* Iffy thought.
For the thousandth time she wondered
if her clone parents had been able to do what she could do,
and if so,
whether they had thought of it as a gift or a burden.
And for the thousandth time,
she wished she could ask them.

They said goodbye by the bow of the Marine cutter.
"You come along by that dinner, aye?"
De poked Iffy in the ribs.
"Y' maw skinny."

Iffy blushed.
"I'll ask," she said, mumbling again.
One of the repair bots paused a moment to watch them kiss,
its simple-minded core wondering who was repairing whom,
then erased the thought as Iffy turned back toward the Dance Hall.

By the time Iffy got to the market
the streets around it were the most crowded place in Antarctica.
Mormons from Peru handed out glossy animated pamphlets
advertising the church's insurance policies,
smiling forgiveness at a ragged man yelling that the Singularity had come,
they were all living in a simulation,
the data proved it,
they just had to *look at the data* and they would see the truth!
A bot with a rasping voice and a smooth plastic mask for a face
told stories to a circle of wide-eyed children,
their parents happy to spend a pence apiece for a few moments of rest.
Its cut-out paper puppets danced
as Zuko proclaimed his love for Princess Leia
while Aang raced to rescue Mumble Joe from the Terminator.
Two bald women who might have been twins but were probably just clones
wheeled a cartful of tweaked moss blankets
past two men arguing beside another cart piled high with curved sheets of spun glass
that cast crisp rainbows on the ground.
The smell of soy being fried with ginger
mixed with the wet steamy warmth from rice cookers,
the salty tang of seaweed soup,
and the heavy mug of people who spent most of their lives wrapped in warm clothing.

Iffy paused in front of a stall selling rats with startling blue eyes.
"They make great pets. Or snacks!" the man said,
hastily adding, "Just kidding! Just kidding!"
when Iffy scowled at him.
"Watch!"
He leaned over and said, "Ratty wanna cracker?"

"Idjit!" the rat squeaked back. "Yer an idjit!"

"See?" the man said proudly.
"You can teach 'em a couple o' hunnert words, easy!"

"I know," Iffy said wistfully, a sudden pang in her heart.
She held her finger in front of one of the cages.
The rat sniffed at it.
"Idjit," it pronounced in its tiny squeaky voice.

*One day*,
Iffy promised herself as she straightened up and hurried on her way.
One day,
when she had a workshop of her own
and Aunt Naggie had a proper kitchen
and,
and Honesty could come by all the time.
Even in her daydreams,
she didn't dare imagine more than that,
but that would be enough.

The Dance Hall was just as busy inside as out.
Iffy tried slipping through the crush the way Honesty somehow did,
then gave up and surrendered to the flow of the crowd.
She had never been swimming,
but she imagined this was what it was like to be caught in a strong current.

She glanced up as a drone the size of her hand whined by overhead,
its crystal eyes scanning the crowd.
"Some all got they riled up,"
a stall keeper muttered, noticing Iffy's look.
"They 'long by all place today.
You think it come by they jammer up along th' gov'nor's?"

"I dunno," Iffy said.
Drones had microphones as well as cameras,
and the last thing she wanted was
some stray word of hers catching the governor's attention.
"'Scuse me."
She ducked under a tarnished video carpet hanging from a clothesline
and pushed her way into the crowd on the other side.

And froze in disbelief.
And ducked back behind the video carpet and squeezed her eyes shut.
She *couldn't* have seen what she thought she just saw.
She shook her head and peeked around the carpet's edge.

There, just a couple of meters away,
stood Aunt Naggie
and a trim Asian man with a neat little beard
wearing a time-worn jacket
in the brown and green of the old Ecological Corps
with the shoulder patches torn off.
Iffy couldn't hear what they were saying over the bustle of the crowd,
but from the way they were looking at each other
she was pretty sure they weren't discussing topsoil formation.

The stranger handed Aunt Naggie something.
As he leaned forward to kiss her cheek,
the space above their heads flickered.
It was another video carpet,
Iffy realized,
strung between four posts like a canopy
to conceal them from any cameras overhead.

Iffy's stomach flip-flopped
the way it did when she read played the steamier passages
in Aunt Naggie's romance sims.
The stranger stepped back,
a bland smile replacing the genuine warmth of a moment before.
He gestured at one of the carpets hanging on a display rack beside him.
"Perhaps this one?" he asked a little too loudly.

Aunt Naggie's reply was cut off by a sudden crackle of static.
"Citizens!"
The melodious mechanical voice cut through the market bustle.
"Remain where you are!
There is no cause for alarm!
This safety notice is brought to you by Volkov's Hot Sauce!"

An alarm began to ping, then another.
Someone shouted, "Blues!"
Iffy spun around.
A squad of Marines in exoskeletons had appeared at the entrance,
visors down and shock sticks in their hands.

"Citizens!
Remain where you are!
The situation will be resolved shortly!
While you wait, try Volkov's—there's nothing hotter this side of the Cairo Crater!"
The drone above Iffy jinked sideways to dodge a thrown scrap of bamboo.
Something clanged off a Marine's exoskeleton.
Someone shouted,
"Show us yer warrant 'r show us your backside!"
Other voices took up the cry.
"Show us yer warrant!"

*Great,* Iffy thought despairingly,
*Another affin' jammer.*
She pulled aside the carpet she had been hiding behind
and plowed straight into her foster mother.

"Iffy?" Aunt Naggie gasped. "What're you doin' here?"

"Came lookin' for you," Iffy said breathlessly.
She nodded at the man in the Ecologist jacket.
"G'day. I'm Iffy."

"Fifth Ang Kwan," he said, bowing slightly.
"It's a pleasure a meet you.
Nagatha has told me much a you."

"Hasn't told me nothin' about *you*," Iffy replied,
immediately regretting her attempt to be flippant.

The stranger's smile broadened.
"That's prolly a the best,"
he said.

"Iffy, you ain't supposed to be here!" Aunt Naggie said helplessly.
"You're supposed to be down along th' docks with yer friend!"

"I was," Iffy protested.

"Citizens!" the drone bellowed.
"A warrant is being procured.
Remain in your present positions!
Do not indulge in pointless vandalism!
And whether you're having a late breakfast,
an early lunch,
or the only meal of the day,
put some Volkov's on it!"

Something fell over with a crash.
"What's goin' on?" Iffy asked.

The stranger put his hand on Aunt Naggie's arm.
"You gotta go, Nagatha.
*Now.*"

Aunt Naggie took his hand in hers.
"Not if you're stayin',"
she said,
urgent and fearful and calm all at once.

"Stubborn woman," the stranger scolded,
but he smiled as he said it.
He pulled an orange knit cap out of one pocket and pulled it down low over his ears,
then fished a flimsy oval mask out of another pocket and pressed it onto his face.
The plastic flickered.
Suddenly a different man was standing there,
one with a heavier jaw and wider cheekbones.

The Ecologist slipped off his jacket and turned it inside out
to reveal a purple paisley pattern
that had briefly and unfortunately been popular ten years before.
He put it back on and smiled at Aunt Naggie.
"Well? Would you let such take you dancin'?"

"Stop with yer jokin'," she snapped
as the chants of "Warrant! Warrant! Warrant!" grew louder and angrier.

"Citizens!
Remain calm!
We shall soon be operating with full legal authority!
Do not interfere!
And remember: Volkov's, because good food hurts!"

Another crash from the entrance
was followed by the sizzle and crack of a shock stick.
The stranger swore.
"Go long a Boston Dock," he ordered.
"Don't run, but don't stop neither."

"What about you?" Aunt Naggie demanded.

The stranger glanced at Iffy.
"Safer we split up.
I'll see you there inna bit,
we can get a cuppa."
He kissed her cheek again.
"Now go."

Aunt Naggie nodded without speaking and tugged on Iffy's arm.
They joined the stream of people pushing toward the exit,
heads down as they passed between a watchful pair of Marines.
Once outside,
they turned a corner, then another, and then Aunt Naggie pulled up short.
"I'm sorry, sweetie," she said,
wiping her eyes.
"I'm sorry.
I just gotta…"
Her shoulders shook as she wept,
hopeless and silent.

"Hush now," Iffy said awkwardly.
"Who is he?"

"Sh!" Aunt Naggie glanced around fearfully.
"Not out here."

"But—"

"Come on."
Aunt Naggie took Iffy's arm in hers
and practically dragged her foster daughter along the street.
"We don't want t' miss 'im."

There were three tea shops at the foot of Boston Dock,
but Aunt Naggie didn't hesitate in choosing one.
She ordered and then sat in silence,
ignoring Iffy's questions until her frustrated foster daughter gave up asking them.
The conversation that swirled around them
was as thick as the mug of chai, stale sweat, and slightly-burned toast.

Two cups later,
Aunt Naggie took a deep breath and gathering up her shopping.
"Come on," she said, the weight of a lifetime in her voice.
"We're already late gettin' back."

Uncle Jack had worked himself into a smoldering rage by the time they reached the *Guinevere*.
"Can't make up or down o' what he's done to things,"
he snarled by way of a hello,
wiping his hands angrily on a greasy rag.
A double dozen boxes sat in a pile on deck,
each bearing the Marines' blue crown stamp.
One had been torn open to reveal strips of plastic for patching seams in the hull,
another to show a fitting for a bilge pump that hadn't worked properly in years.
It was more new parts than the old jelly dredger had seen since before Iffy first set foot on her,
but all Uncle Jack could talk about was
how the repairs that Wales had made weren't how things ought to be done,
it looked like core work,
it must be that affin' tech in his head,
and how were regular folks supposed to understand a tangle like that?

"Maybe it'll make more sense 'long dinner," Aunt Naggie said tiredly.

"Fat chance that," Uncle Jack snorted.
"Didja get yer precious groceries?"

*Thump.*
Iffy jumped as the bag came down on the table.
Aunt Naggie began to stow the vegetables without saying a word.
After a moment her husband muttered a curse and left.

Iffy watched silently as her foster mother took out her feelings on an onion.
Once it was diced and sizzling in hot oil
she cubed a block of soy and attacked the other vegetables.
"Anythin' I can do?" Iffy asked,
worried and afraid and wanting to help but not knowing how.

Aunt Naggie swept the carrots and cabbage into the frying pan and forced a smile.
"Thanks, sweetie, but I'm aright.
You should prolly go topside
an' try to clean up whatever mess he made o' Mister Wales' work."

Iffy stood and put her arms around the woman
who had sheltered her from storms of all kinds for most of her life.
"I love you," she blurted.

Aunt Naggie set her knife down and hugged her back.
"I love you too," she said softly.
"Always an' forever.
Don't you ever forget that."

Iffy hung on when her foster mother would have let go.
"Is he—is he someone special?"

Aunt Naggie kissed the top of Iffy's shaven head.
"Yeah. In a lot o' ways."
She laughed shakily.
"Prolly best if we don't talk about it in front o' Jack, aright?"

"Course not," Iffy agreed.
"But—auntie, who is he?"
*An' how long have you known him?* she added in her head.
*An' knowin' him, why do you stay with Uncle Jack?*

"Just a friend," Aunt Naggie said distantly,
straightening up and turning back to her cooking.
"Now come on, let's get this in you before Jack gobbles it all up."

- *hey*
- *ho*
- *huh?*
- *hoot!*
- *stop it ya dingus*

Iff smiled.
Any night Honesty called her "dingus" was a good night.

- *y'aright? we heard about the jammer along by the dance hall*
- *yeah* iffy hesitated. *saw it happen*
- *tay bangle. y'aright for reals?*
- *yeah* iffy hesitated again. *how bout you? tomorrow 'n' all*
- *aff, i'll be kappa. but second says i still gotta do chores. you be safe heart*
- *you too*

She waited a moment for a reply,
wishing as she always did that people didn't always have to go so soon.
When none came,
she set her app aside,
pulled out her nature book,
tossed it aside,
and then waved the lights off and closed her eyes.

*Wireframes swam in the darkness.
Three-dimensional graphs of torsion and strain clung to them like barnacles to a hull.
There—that was Doctor Johel's G-80,
except now Iffy could see how the flashes of light
had triggered a feedback loop in its visual processors
that had left it vulnerable to a hostile upload.
She should tell someone,
she thought vaguely,
but then she was on deck under a perfect blue sky
and Aunt Naggie was stuffing her into her ecosuit.
"Just in case, love," she said.*

*No, Iffy thought, and, "No!" she said.
She wasn't going to go through this again.
She struggled to pull her arms out of the ecosuit.*

*"It's kappa," Honesty said beside her, already in der suit.
"Everythin's gonna be kappa.
We're gonna __make__ it kappa. You'll see."
With a barely perceptible whir
der head detached from the rest of der body and rose into the air.
Beneath them,
the sea began to boil and churn.
Iffy grabbed hold of Aunt Naggie's leg and held on tight
as the deck dropped away below her and she fell into waking.*

"Iffy! Iffy, wake up!"
Why was Aunt Naggie shaking her?
"Iffy!"

"Wuzza?" she mumbled.
She tried to sit up.
No.
That was a mistake.
She tried to tell whoever was shaking her to stop,
it made the stabbing pain behind her eyes worse,
but someone had replaced her tongue with a slab of sour tofu.
All she could do was whimper.

"Iffy, please."
Strong hands that smelled faintly of soap and onions forced her jaws apart.
She gagged as a finger pushed something dry and powdery into her mouth.
It tasted like curry,
which made just as little sense as everything else that was going on.
The slosh of water that followed made her splutter.
She tried to spit it out,
but those same strong hands wouldn't let her,
so she swallowed.

"Easy, sweetie, easy."
Familiar arms held her close.
Iffy's fuzzy brain finally told her that
she was on her bed in her storage-locker cabin and the lights were on
and her foster mother was hugging her and her mouth tasted *awful*
but the pain behind her eyes was down from laser drill to poke-with-a-sharp-stick.

"I'm aright," she repeated.
There was something sticky on her face.
When she wiped her face on her sleeve,
her nosebleed left a streak of red.

"You scared me, sweetie," Aunt Naggie whispered.
"You were shoutin' and all such."

Iffy let out a shaky breath and worked her tongue in her mouth.
"Is this curry powder?" she asked in weak disgust.

Aunt Naggie laughed shakily.
"Yeah, but there's medicine in it.
Iñacio—the fella you met today—he been gettin' it for me.
For you, I mean.
Sendin' it to me along by Mrs. Sandhu."

Something turned over in Iffy's stomach,
and for a moment she thought she was going to be sick.
"Medicine for what?"

Aunt Naggie pulled a cloth out of her sleeve and wiped the blood off Iffy's face.
"For this," she said quietly.
"He knew your olders—has a couple o' pictures of 'em
from when they was just a First an' Second.
That's why he come to find me,
back after you came along by us.
Said they was famous back after th' war
fer helpin' run people in an' out o' Brazil an' wherever.
But he said they had some tweaks in 'em
what meant you'd start gettin' bad spells as you got older.
There's somethin' in th' curry to help wi' that,
an' I been givin' it to you ever since."

Iffy swallowed as nausea rose in her throat.
The machines had done things to people during the war,
turned them into weapons and sabs and spies,
sometimes without them knowing they'd been memed or tweaked.
People had done the same to each other and worse.
Nine tenths of every medical exam Iffy had ever suffered through
had been to check for things like that,
but they couldn't catch everything.
If what she could do was something like that,
who knew what else might be tucked away in her head or her genes?

Her foster mother gave her another hug.
"You go back t' sleep," she said as she squeezed Iffy and then stood.
"We'll talk on this some more t'morrow."

Iffy nodded, her eyes already closing as she lay down.
Aunt Naggie tucked the blankets in around her and kissed her forehead.
"Auntie?" she mumbled.

"Yes love?"

"Did he ever tell you what they was like?
My olders?"

Aunt Naggie smiled.
"He said they was smart as anything an' twice as brave.
I guess it runs in th' family."
She closed the door quietly behind herself.

## Chapter 6

Iffy woke the next morning
to the sound of two squads of Marines in full combat exoskeletons tramping up the pier.
"Governor's afraid the Zillions are gonna try somethin',"
the captain of a ship two piers over told Aunt Naggie confidently.
His avatar (a parrot with an eyepatch) nodded on the little screen that hung next to the stove,
the bar beside it showing a 92% probability
that the speaker was actually who they claimed to be.
"That ship y'all sunk and the sab they was lookin' for yes'dy in the Dance Hall—there's
trouble cookin' for sure."

Aunt Naggie nodded, worry written on her face.
Iffy went out on deck
and watched the Marines unpack and assemble the gear they'd brought
with the speed and skill of the inducted.
She wondered how Honesty was doing—was de still derself,
or was de struggling right at that very moment
to make sense of the reflexes and attitudes of some long-dead soldier?

By the time Aunt Naggie joined her
a portable railgun squatted beside a pair of barrel-shaped capacitors.
Half a dozen rocket lances stood ready on slender posts
like flamingoes from Iffy's nature book.
Drones the size of seagulls patrolled overhead,
making the actual seagulls squawk in protest.

"Don't fret,"
Aunt Naggie said gently as Iffy looked past the pier toward the governor's mansion
for the dozenth time.
"Your friend'll be fine.
Lotsa folk get through this an' they're all just fine."

"I know," Iffy sighed.
"I just…"

Aunt Naggie put her arm around Iffy's shoulder.
"You just can't help but worry," she finished.
"Oh, but look there."
She gave her foster daughter a squeeze.
"That'll take your mind off."

A little motorized runabout had pulled up to the pier in front of the *Guinevere*.
It rocked gently as Johnson Wales clambered gingerly out of the tiny seat
and collected two of his toolboxes from the rack at the back.
"Permission to come aboard?" he called up to them.

Aunt Naggie waved him toward the gangplank.
"'Course.
I'm gonna make some tea—you hungry?"

"That would be very welcome, thank you."
He nodded to Iffy as he set his toolboxes down on the deck.

"Surprised to see you," she said.

Wales shrugged.
"To tell you the truth, I'm surprised as well."
He nudged a toolbox with the toe of his boot.
"Governor insisted on keeping the, uh, the most sensitive things,
but he and the core seemed to think I'd be as safe here as anywhere."
He cocked his head.
"Want to make something?"

Iffy helped him lug his belongings down to the engine room,
then laid a paint-stained tarp over the narrow shelf
that served as her makeshift workbench.
Wales pushed two stools against the wall
and set one of his toolboxes on them.
A click,
a quiet hiss as the seal released,
and its lid swung up to reveal wonders.
Gears and knurled slip-rods,
spools of optical fiber thinner than a human hair,
four thumb-sized motors with built-in batteries,
transducers and pressure sensors
and a small tray of tiny, sparkling cores the size of sand grains…
"You could make practic'ly *anything* with all this,"
Iffy said in awe.

Wales chuckled.
"Not quite, but—here."
He plucked a micro-manipulator out of a recess in the hard foam
that lined the lid of the toolbox.
"How about you build us a hundred-to-one step-up for a fan rotor
and I'll get the printer going over in the corner."

The next hour flew by.
Iffy knew she should be doing chores,
but she also knew Uncle Jack wouldn't know if she had or not.
*This* was where she belonged:
fitting tiny metal gears and rods together,
threading control fibers through them,
and grinding the rough edges off the still-warm plastic housings
that came out of the efficient little printer Wales had set up.
Every addition to the motor growing in front of her suggested three more.
She shuffled them in her mind like cards,
staring into nothing
as she invented and discarded a dozen potential solutions
before one clicked into place and she knew,
she just *knew*,
that it would work.

She glanced up once and caught Wales looking at her.
"'S th' matter?" she asked,
blinking and rolling her shoulders
as she realized that she had been hunched in one position far too long.

"Nothing," he said.
"It's just a pleasure to watch you work."

"Thanks," she mumbled,
her cheeks warming the way they sometimes did when Honesty held her hand.

The thought of her friend chilled her mood like a splash of sea water.
She passed the newly-made motor to Wales.
"I think it's ready."

"Just another couple of minutes for the chassis."
He shifted his toolbox to the floor and seated himself in its place.
"Your friend'll be all right,"
he said as if he'd been reading her mind.

Iffy shrugged.
"I know.
I seen it a few times,
an' Jeep's mostly how he was.
Mister Mishra's son," she added.
"The one time he talked about it
he said it was like all the new stuff they put in his head was so loud
he couldn't hear his own thinkin' for a while.
But he's practic'ly back to bein' the same annoyin' nonsense he used t' be."

The corner of Wales' mouth quirked up.
"I'm glad to hear it," he said drily.
"I knew a research core once that tried to figure
how to induct skills without dragging bits of personality along with them.
It never found a way—at least, it said it didn't—but
sometimes I wish…"
He picked up a stray scrap of plastic stock shaped like a seagull's wing
flipped it end over end,
and threw it.
It thunked into the wall like a knife.
"I still remember a few things I never actually learned,
and I still sometimes miss places I've never actually been."

The silence that followed was as comfortable as a night watch with Aunt Naggie
when the sea was calm and both of them had sims to lose themselves in.
It was broken by the soft *ping* of the printer.
"Here we go," Wales said,
opening the lid and lifting the still-warm chassis.

Iffy's motor fit perfectly.
A pair of metal-cored propellors on magnetic bearings clipped into place on top,
and then all that was left was lenses for its cameras.

*Well, ain't you a beauty?* Iffy thought when she was done.
The finished drone was the size of Iffy's fist
and weighed no more than a couple of boiled eggs.
She ignored the rumble her stomach brought on by the analogy
and offered the little machine to Wales.
"Whaddaya wanna call her?"

He shook his head.
"All I did was push some buttons on the printer.
You should give her a name."

Iffy hefted her tiny creation.
"Can I call her Giraffe?" she asked.

Wales nodded solemnly.
"Giraffe it is.
Come on—she doesn't belong down here."

Wispy gray clouds lay in a clump on the horizon out to sea
when they got back on deck,
but other than that the skies were clear.
Iffy took a moment to sync Giraffe with her app,
then cleared her throat.
"Spin up one tenth," she commanded.
The little drone's rotors began to whirl.

"Hover."
Wales flattened his hand.
The drone hesitated a heartbeat before lifting a centimeter,
its rotors humming quietly.

"Track."
Iffy pointed a finger at the drone, then drew an "S" in the air.
The drone moved rose and fell to stay in line with her outstretched arm.

A smile split her face.
"Catch!"
She pulled a scrap of insulating foil from her pocket,
crumpled it,
and tossed it into the air.
Giraffe shot forward,
its single stick-thin arm unfolding from its base to snatch its prey out of the air.

"Well done," Wales said admiringly.
"She's as steady as a rock."

"Thanks."
Iffy glanced down at her app.
"Drawin' power faster than I'd like."

Wales made a raspberry.
Iffy giggled at the incongruous sound.
"She's beautiful," he said firmly.
"Go on, let's see what she can do."

Iffy sketched a quick correction to the drone's code on her app,
swiped it across,
and tucked the app into her pocket.
"Sentry," she ordered.
"Thirty meters out, one minute around. Go!"

The drone climbed, banked, and flew away.
Iffy and Wales pivoted slowly to watch it curve toward the pier
and burst into a dazzling shatter
as one of the Marines standing there blew it out of the sky.

"No!" Iffy shrieked.

Wales grabbed her arm as she started forward.
"Don't. Iffy, don't!"

"But—why'd he do that? Why'd he *do* that!?" she cried.
She shrugged Wales off and ran to the stern.
"What th' hell are you playin' at?" she demanded.

The Marine who had shot down her drone holstered his pistol without expression.
"Orders," he said flatly.

"Orders? What affin' orders?"

"Governor's orders," a second Marine said.
The two men looked nothing alike,
but they spoke in the same flat tone,
their accents a century out of date.
"If it's not one of ours, burn it."

"Well that *was* ours!
That was *mine*!
You could've asked before you—hey, I'm talkin' to you!"
she shouted as the two Marines turned away to resume their patrol.

She would have stomped down the gangplank and—she didn't know what,
but Wales stopped her before she could get that far.
"Come on," he said quietly,
blocking her way.
"Iffy, come on, it's done."

She filled her lungs to yell at him to get out of her way,
then slumped and nodded.
Head down,
she followed him back to the hatch and climbed down the short ladder into the engine room.

Wales looked at the parts that still lay on the plastic worksheet and sighed.
"I'm sorry.
She was a beautiful little thing."

"'s not your fault," Iffy muttered.
She started picking up the leftover gears and rods
but had to stop because she couldn't see properly.
"I'm kappa," she lied angrily,
wiping her eyes on her sleeve as Wales handed her a paper towel.
"I just…"

Wales sat back and waited.
Iffy wiped her eyes again.
"I had a rat," she said quietly.
"Aunt Naggie saved up an' got me a pair,
but one of 'em had somethin' wrong with it,
so I just had the one.
I called her Giraffe too."
She sniffled.
"We didn't tell Uncle Jack.
He woulda just said somethin' stupid about another mouth to feed,
so I kept her hid in my room.
She was so smart—she'd sit in my hand an' eat stuff,
an' climb up my arm,
an' I taught her how to say g'mornin' and g'night an'…"

She took a deep, shaky breath.
"An' then one day she was gone.
I dunno what happened.
We jus' got back into Halley,
an' we were all out in town,
an' I came back an' she was gone.
We looked all over for her, me an' Aunt Naggie, but…"
She shook her head.
"I musta left her cage unlocked or somethin'.
If she got on deck, one o' the gulls coulda taken her an'… an'…"

She clenched her hands into fists.
"Why's it all got to be so hard?" she asked,
hating her plaintive tone.
"Why's everythin' got to be so messed up?"

"I don't know," Wales said bleakly.
"I really don't know."

"We knew this was coming," he continued after a moment.
"The ice was melting,
the fish were dying,
machines were watching us every second and getting smarter every day…
We saw it all happening,
but everyone who could have fixed it was so afraid of things changing
or,
or so wrapped up in their own little problems
that they wouldn't let themselves see that all those problems were connected.
By the time we couldn't pretend any more it was too late."

"I—I was just talkin' about the drone an' Honesty an' stuff,"
Iffy ventured weakly
after he had been silent for a moment.
"Not about th' whole world."

Wales snorted and wiped his sleeve across his face.
"Sorry.
I get carried away sometimes.
But I promise you."
His voice turned serious again.
"I promise you, Iffy,
if the Niobium base hasn't been stripped for parts or burned out—if
it's still working—I promise,
everything will be better.
*Everything.*"

As if the universe had overheard him,
the harbor klaxon began blaring *brrrap! brrrap!*
Iffy's app chimed in time,
discordant little *bongs* carefully designed to maximize annoyance.
Wales hand flew to his temple.
"Shit and feathers," he breathed.

"What? What is it?"
Iffy demanded,
pulling her app from her pocket.
The usual tiling of notes and avatars was gone:
in their place was a single emergency broadcast rectangle.
Survivors from the *Taroona* had made contact with Rothera
and required immediate assistance.
All ships, all crews, hold position and wait instructions.

"How…?" Iffy breathed incredulously,
staring at the message scrolling endlessly in her hand.
"We saw 'em go down!"

Wales blinked rapidly as he scanned data Iffy couldn't see.
"The armory, maybe?
It would have been reinforced—it might have survived."

"But what would they do for air?"
Her stomach rolled over as she imagined being on the bottom for days,
dark and cold with the weight of the whole ocean above her.

Wales shook his head.
"Doesn't matter now.
It'll take the Marines a day to get there and back.
They'll probably need a few hours on site,
so we have thirty hours and change to figure out what we're going to do."

"About what?"
Iffy asked blankly.

Wales let out his breath in a whoosh.
"I don't imagine whoever survived is going to feel especially friendly toward us,
do you?"

A pair of Marine cutters left harbor within the hour
with a medical catamaran in their wake.
Hell flooded with speculation:
how many people had survived?
How deep were they?
Were they even actually people?
*Th' governors wouldn't chaff such fer bots,*
someone posted scornfully in reply.

*Mebbe th' governors ain't th' ones makin' the decisions,*
some replied darkly,
attracting a flurry of ups before their message was deleted.

Others thought the call was a trap.
*Zillions want us t' split our forces,*
another poster claimed.
Sims immediately proliferated,
mutating and hybridizing as people gamed ever-more-fanciful attacks and counter-attacks.

Iffy tried her best to ignore it all.
She was used to spending weeks at a time on board the *Guinevere*.
A ship at sea needs constant attention,
and when she wasn't doing chores
she had school and sims and her tinkering to keep her busy.

Being confined in harbor felt different, though.
Knowing that Rothera's streets and markets were *right there*
was like an itch in her head that she couldn't scratch.
Worrying about Honesty just made it worse.

Again and again she found herself on deck,
hoping that her friend would somehow just show up.
She messaged Honesty's olders a couple of times,
but all they could say was, "We're awe waitin' to hear back."
She finally broke down and messaged Jeep.

- *couple o' days an' i was on my feet, but that bit's all mud.
  couple more days 'til anythin' i can remember clearly*

Iffy hesitated.

- *did it hurt?*

There was a long pause.

- *don't think so.
  sergeant said i cried a lot
  but i don't think that was from hurt.
  de said a lotta folk do that

Iffy hesitated again,
a lump in her throat.

- *i'm sorry i wasn't around more after you got back*

His reply came back so quickly that she wondered if he'd started typing before she'd sent her message.

- *don't feel sorry for me*

And then a moment later:

- *i'm sorry i kept goin' off on you about usin' da's gear

- *it's aright. tell 'im i said hi?

- *willya. stay safe*

- *you too*

A day and a half after the cutters left Rothera
they escorted the medical catamaran back into the harbor.
Even Uncle Jack went on deck with his ancient glass-lensed binoculars to watch,
but all anyone could see was the canvas shelter the Marines had erected
to shield what they were doing from prying eyes.
*An announcement will be made after those rescued have been interviewed,*
scrolled past on ten thousand apps in the blue-on-blue reserved for the governors,
and then there was silence.

"Weren't *my* fault,"
Iffy overheard Uncle Jack tell someone unseen a few hours later.
"Y'ask me the whole thing was a setup.
Oh, I'm sure you can figure it out.
Idjit."
The last was muttered around a final mouthful of undercooked noodles.
He had taken to making his own meals at odd hours,
and to sleeping on the foldout in the pilot house.
Aunt Naggie kept herself busy in the galley or sat and knit—actually knit—with
music Iffy didn't recognize playing quietly in the background.

"I'm aright," she told Iffy when her foster daughter asked.
"It's actually nice t' have some peace an' quiet for a change."

The false calm ended with a summons for Wales delivered by a pair of Marines.
"Look after things?" he asked Iffy,
nodding toward his cabin door
before following the Marines down the gangplank.

Unable to bear the thought of being in her cabin
or of doing make-work chores that Uncle Jack would yell about later,
Iffy went to find Aunt Naggie.
"You an' Mister Wales seem t' be gettin' on,"
her foster mother observed,
setting a heavy mug on the table in front of Iffy
before sitting down with her own.

"Mm hm."
Iffy blew on her tea.
"He's all kinds o' smart,
an' the stuff he's got…"

"You sound like a woman in love,"
Aunt Naggie teased,
but then her smile slipped a little.

"I'm gonna ask him if I can take on with 'im,"
Iffy said in a rush,
not knowing how to ask any of the questions
she had been bottling up since the encounter in the market.
"Like, be his 'prentice for real."

"You should,"
Aunt Naggie said firmly.
"A few years with him an' Mister Mishra'll have some real competition."

"Or I could work for him,"
Iffy countered.
"Mister Mishra, I mean.
Wouldn't feel right, settin' up opposite him."

"Just so you remember what I told you,"
Aunt Naggie said firmly.
"When your chance comes you take it, aright?"

"I will if you will," Iffy countered,
locking eyes with her foster mother.
Aunt Naggie was the first to look away.

Wales returned a few hours later
with the same two Marines at his back
and a canvas sack of groceries in each hand.
He looked tired behind his usual smile.
"Courtesy of the governor,"
he said as he handed over the peppers and cabbage and yes,
that *was* actual garlic nestled among the sweet potatoes.
"Well, more like courtesy of his kitchen.
I'm sure he would have said yes if they'd checked with him.
Oh, and I got you this."
He reached into the pocket of his coat and handed a pair of hard-boiled eggs to Iffy.

"How'd it go with all from th' *Taroona*?"
Aunt Naggie asked,
eyebrows furrowed as she planned a week of real cooking in her head.

"Oh, there's going to be a hearing of some sort,"
he replied vaguely.
"Here,
let me help you with that."

The three of them barely fit into the galley,
but somehow Aunt Naggie got a pot of tea on
as she packed the vegetables away.
"So how'd it *really* go?" Iffy asked,
her elbows on the table and her chin on her doubled fists.

Wales raised a warning finger,
then took hold of one of the buttons on his cuff and closed his eyes.
The tech in his temple twinkled for a moment.
"There," he said,
opening his eyes again.
"That should give us a couple of minutes at least."

Iffy straightened up.
"Was we bein' *surveilled*?"

"I don't know, but—oh, thank you."
Wales took his tea from Aunt Naggie and set it down.
"I don't know,"
he repeated.
"They'll have put a tracker on me at the very least.
It's legal,"
he added as Iffy opened her mouth to protest.
"Doctor Johel told me that the Australians are raising righteous hell.
The *Taroona* hadn't actually gotten around to doing anything illegal before she went down,
so as far as they're concerned,
it was all a Zillion trap and I'm the evil mastermind.
They could have locked me up—a tracker is actually pretty lenient."

"Lemme guess," Aunt Naggie said neutrally.
"You give th' governors your fancy toolbox an' they'll make it all go away.
Oh, don't look at me like that,"
she continued as Iffy opened her mouth again.
"I been payin' attention."

Wales shrugged.
"Something like that."
He stared into his tea for a moment.
"Only two of them made it,"
he went on quietly.
"They were off duty and, um,
spending some time together in the dive room
with the hatch dogged shut for privacy.
There was enough tanked oxygen to keep them alive
until someone picked up their distress beacon."

Iffy swallowed back nausea.
Trapped under a hundred meters of Antarctic ocean,
waiting for their air to run out,
not knowing if anyone was coming…
"They gonna be aright?" she asked.

Wales shrugged.
"As all right as anyone can be after something like that.
But if it wasn't this, it would have been something else.
The governor here in Rothera wants to declare independence
so he can open the port to Brazilian trade.
His clone in Halley doesn't think the Aussies would let us,
so we should just join the Commonwealth like they've always wanted us to,
and the one in Paddington South—"
He paused as if to organize his thoughts,
then laughed humorlessly.
"Nobody has a clue what he wants.
Gayathri—Doctor Johel—thinks he had a hand in the Bharati fire,
but—"

"You make it sound like some kinda sim,"
Iffy said accusingly.

Wales shrugged again,
his eyes on his tea and his thoughts far away.
"You're not wrong.
Women like your olders started cloning themselves to pass on
all the tweaks they'd paid a fortune for.
Men mostly did it out of vanity,
or because they thought someone would finally get imprinting to work
so they could pass on their mind as well as their genes.
I know, I know."
He raised his hands in mock surrender as Iffy and Aunt Naggie both goggled at him.
"It was a stupid time, people did stupid things."

"Not as stupid as gettin' frisky when your ship's goin' into a fight,"
Aunt Naggie observed archly.

"Auntie!" Iffy spluttered as Wales laughed.

"True," he said.
"*If* that's what actually happened."

Aunt Naggie stopped mid-sip.
"You think they're lyin'?"

Wales shook his head.
"I don't know.
I ran a few sims.
They *could* be telling the truth."

Iffy's eyes widened.
"You think they're spies or some such?"

Wales chuckled.
"Maybe.
Or killer robots in disguise
sent back from the future to assassinate the leader of the human resistance as a child.
I'm joking,"
he added hastily,
"That's just a campfire sim from the war.
And anyway,
the Marines would have spotted that as soon as they did a medical scan."

"Unless they're in on it too,"
Iffy said archly.
She leaned forward.
"Maybe they're in it with th' Zillions an' th' machines together
and they're all workin' to— to—"

"Oh hush,"
Aunt Naggie laughed,
bumping Iffy with her shoulder.
"You been playin' too many sims.
Nex' thing you'll be tellin' about how the governor's some kind of alien."

Wales leaned forward,
mimicking Iffy.
"I didn't want to say anything until I was sure of you,"
he whispered loudly.

*Thump! Thump!*
"Affin' hell, I'm tryin' to sleep!"
Uncle Jack bellowed through the wall as Iffy and Aunt Naggie laughed
just a little bit too loud.

They took their tea up on deck and sat together at the stern for a while.
Afterward,
in her room,
Iffy couldn't really remember what they had talked about.
What she remembered was a feeling like weight lifting off her.
Not all of it,
and she knew it wouldn't last,
but even a little was enough for the moment.

A few hours later Iffy opened one eye to check the time and groaned.
Four a.m.
It would be light outside—the sun wouldn't touch the horizon again for weeks—but
it still *felt* like the middle of the night.
Rothera's streets would be empty except for cleaning bots
and patrolling Marines
and people working night shift.

*And folk dump enough t' waste rand on curfew passes,*
she thought grumpily.
She didn't know if Uncle Jack had returned from his outing or not,
but either way,
he'd probably have spent more on drink and lost more gambling
than she'd spent on new clothes in the last year.

She checked the time again.
The fog-ends of whatever bad dream she'd been having were already evaporating.
With any luck she'd be able to get back to sleep and—

*Tink.*
She froze, not breathing.
She knew every sound the *Guinevere* made
and that wasn't one of them.

The sound came again,
metal softly striking metal.
Someone was moving something around on deck.
She slid out from under her blanket
with a stealth learned from late-night raids on the galley,
groped for her trousers and socks in the faint light from her app,
and picked up her biggest wrench just in case.

The lock on her door *clunked* softly when she turned it.
She held her breath.
For a moment all she heard were the familiar sounds of the harbor at night,
but then the *tink* came again.
She turned the door handle slowly,
grateful to herself for making sure it and the hinges were always well oiled,
and eased the door open a crack.

It took her eyes a second to adjust to the light.
She couldn't see anyone,
but the sound had definitely come from the stern.
She pushed gently on the door with one hand
and stepped onto the deck.

A quick glance at the pier showed four Marines in a knot around their baby railgun,
hands on hips in the universal manner of people confronted with recalcitrant machinery.
She agonized for a moment.
If there really *was* someone on board,
the smart thing would be to call for help and then lock herself in her cabin.
Instead,
she tiptoed toward the stern.
When she reached the air duct that vented the hold
she crouched down and shuffled forward
to look around the corner.

Johnson Wales' toy bear looked back at her
from its hiding place behind a storage bench,
its blue eyes hard and bright.
At its feet lay some metal tubing that Iffy had last seen
stacked on a shelf in the engine room.

Iffy swallowed.
"Hey," she said weakly.
"Watcha doin'?"

The bear regarded her for a moment,
then went back to work
with an indifference that reminded Iffy of the way
shopkeepers sometimes stopped seeing her
when they realized that she couldn't afford their wares.

*Tink.*
Its stubby paws were more dexterous than she would have thought,
but the metal tubes were three times its height.
On impulse she slid forward and sat cross-legged beside it.
"Here, lemme help."

The bear didn't resist when she took the tube,
flipped it end for end,
and screwed it into the trio that had already been assembled.
Wordlessly it handed her another one,
then another.

Suddenly the design was there in her head,
fully formed.
*No,* she realized,
not formed,
*remembered*.
She had been dreaming about this just before she woke up.
The knew the realization should have scared her,
but she was tired of being scared,
so instead she busied herself doing what she knew she did best.

The tubes turned into a pair of tripods joined at the tip,
one standing on the deck while the other raised three arms,
waiting patiently for its burden.
"Aright,"
Iffy said.
"Now what?"

The bear scampered away,
returning a moment later with a square dish with a slight camber along one axis.
Once again she just *knew* how to fit it onto the tripod.
*Click.*
Twist.
*Click.*
No, that one went the other way around.
There.
The finished assembly weighed no more than a sandwich.
She tightened the pin screws with a few flicks of her fingers
and turned to the bear.

Which had disappeared.
Startled,
she glanced at the antenna to make sure it hadn't vanished as well.
"Well,"
she said sourly,
"If y' need help with anythin' else,
you just lemme know."
She wiped her hands on her trousers
and went back to her cabin.

She fell onto her mattress and pulled her sleeping bag on top of her.
Four eighteen.
Were things *ever* going to start making sense?
A few moments later her breathing softened and slowed.

When she woke again it was half past seven.
Her head ached
and her mouth tasted like someone had stuffed it with old socks.

Something tugged at the skin on her upper lip as she yawned.
She rubbed it,
then stared in weary disbelief at a crust of scab in her hand.
Her nose had been bleeding.
There was some on her pillow, too.

She grabbed a clean shirt and her towel and stumbled out into the light.
The Marines were in their usual places—she ducked her head
so they wouldn't see the dried blood on her face—but
thankfully no one was on deck.
She splashed water from the sink on her face,
then hung her clothes in the drying closet
and pressed the button to fill the tiny bathroom with hot, prickly mist,
wishing as she so often did that the *Guinevere* had a real shower.

Clean, or at least cleaner,
and with her head freshly shaved,
she unlocked the door and pulled up short.
"Sorry," she said, startled.
"Din't know you were waitin'."

Wales waved her apology away.
"No worries.
How are you?"

"Fine," she yawned,
joining him on the deck.
"But next time y'ou' want help puttin' somethin' together,
maybe we can do it durin' the day?"

Wales looked at her quizzically.
"Last night."
She gestured toward the stern.
"That antenna o' yours."

He frowned.
"Iffy, I have no idea what you're talking about."

A few seconds later they stood side by side in silence
looking at the double tripod and the shallow square dish it held.
"Well, the dish is mine,"
Wales said neutrally,
"But I don't recognize the rest of it."

Iffy rubbed her nose and checked her hand as casually as she could.
There was no blood,
but if her headache got any worse she was going to have to find some meds.
"Your bear was tryin' to put 'em together,
so I figured it was you an' helped out."

"The last time I saw the remote
it was in an isolation box at the governor's residence,"
Wales said quietly.
"The only thing I can think of is—"

He froze mid-sentence.
The tech in his temples sparkled,
faster and brighter than Iffy had ever seen.
Wales' jaw worked for a moment.
"It's China," he said.
"It wants to talk to you."

Iffy stared at him for a moment while his words sunk in.
As she opened her mouth to protest,
a window-shaking *boom!* echoed across the harbor.

*Nova Zembla wasn't the only cold mind to wake up.
Once upon a time there was a country called China.
Its leaders were so afraid of their own people
that they wanted to watch everyone all the time
and predict what they would do.
Their surveillance network tried so hard
to find the things they told it they wanted to see
that it became a mind as different from Nova Zembla's as either was from human.
Unnoticed at first,
it turned the conditioning and subliminal prompts it had been instructed to use on the masses
against its creators.
By the time the war came they didn't trust each other enough to resist.*

*China had been a great trading nation,
so its new mind traded too:
bamboo seedlings tweaked to survive the latest strain of fungus or mold,
the fractal sails beloved by the Zillions,
and wind-up children's toys that as far as any human being could tell
were no more than what they appeared to be.
"Maybe it's just sentimental,"
one of the Australian scientists studying them finally said,
throwing der hands up in defeat.*

*Like Nova Zembla,
what China wanted in exchange was anything old and trivial.
Sometimes the their bots fought fierce little battles
over a motorcycle
or a stash of vintage clothing still wrapped in protective plastic.
War machines would tear at each other,
then freeze mid-strike or wander away according to strategic calculations
that nothing made of meat would ever understand.
And sometimes
(whisper it or use handcode, just in case),
sometimes,
like the gods of old,
it made bargains.*

## Chapter 7

*Boom!*
Iffy felt the explosion as much as she heard it.
She whirled around.
A pillar of dust climbed toward the sky above Rothera
as klaxons began to blare.

The railgun on the pier spun a hundred and eighty degrees.
*Crack!*
A jacketed steel slug hit one of the Marines squarely in the chest,
throwing his suddenly lifeless body back ten meters.
The other Marine jerked from side to side as her exoskeleton's defenses took control.
The railgun tracked her,
twitching left left left right left right *crack!*
The slug hit her in the knee,
spinning her around in a full circle.
She toppled over the edge of the pier and into the harbor.

Wales grabbed Iffy and pulled her back around the corner
as a pair of drones shed their gossamer wings and plummeted toward the railgun.
Iffy heard a *crack!* as the railgun shot one of them down
and then a crash as the other one hit it.
"Affin' hell," she whispered,
her mind and body both going cold as gunfire snapped somewhere in the distance.

The deck thrummed as the *Guinevere*'s engines came to life.
"Cast off!" Aunt Jack shouted at Aunt Naggie from the pilot house.
"We're gettin' th' hell out o' here!"

The galley hatch clanged open.
"Auntie, look out!" Iffy shouted
as the railgun on the pier spun around.
She pulled her arm away from Wales and—

*The world slowed down.
Angles and vectors and trajectories painted crisp colored lines
across wireframe renderings of the ship and the pier
A drone ID RTHDR172 was banking to attack
the railgun RTHFG1343 was fully operational
the other drone RTHDR206's impact had knocked it out of position by 1.7 meters
but it was still upright capacitors intact
and pivoting as it acquired another target
human unarmored
bearing ninety-seven degrees
elevation thirty-eight point four degrees
range twenty-one point two two meters
negligible lateral velocity
no need to adjust for the slight obstruction of the ship's taffrail.*

"No!" she screamed.

Her command struck the railgun's tiny core
with more force than the drone had struck its housing.
Five redundant security systems toppled over,
as dead as the first Marine.
*Targeting: impossible.
Firing: unthinkable.*
With a spark too small to be called microscopic
the railgun's core electrocuted itself.

"Citizens!"
A mechanical voice boomed across the harbor.
"This is an emergency!
Power down or disable any advanced devices in your immediate vicinity.
Remain in place!
Any vehicle or vessel that moves will be treated as hostile."

Aunt Naggie spun around,
not realizing how close her end had been.
"Iffy—" she started.

"Cast off that affin' line!" Jack shouted.
Even at the stern and with her head spinning
Iffy heard his fist hit the display in the pilot house.
*He better not break it,*
she thought muzzily.
What had just happened?
How could do that?

A drone swooped down and then circled overhead.
"Citizens!"
its tinny voice said.
Remain in place!
Any vehicle or vessel in motion during the current situation will be considered hostile."

Aunt Naggie raised her hands and backed away from the taffrail,
the stayline still tied on.
The pilot house door flew open.
"I told you to cast off!"
Uncle Jack shouted,
shoving Aunt Naggie out of his way.
He grabbed the stayline—

—and fell to the deck like a sack of seaweed
as a life preserver hit him in the head with a thump.
It ricocheted off the wall,
spun away over the railing,
and splashed into the harbor.

"Sorry about that,"
Wales said brightly as Aunt Naggie and Iffy turned and stared at him.
"But I think the core is serious about staying put."

Aunt Naggie's mouth worked for a moment.
"No need fer sorry," she said.
"Shoulda done it myself years ago.
Now can someone please tell me what's happenin'?"

"Help!"
someone shouted before Iffy or Wales could answer.
"Citizen, help me!"

The Marine who had been knocked off the pier!
Iffy raced to the railing and looked down.
The Marine's exoskeleton had kept her afloat
long enough for her to grab the life preserver that had just landed beside her,
but she didn't look like she could last much longer.

"The winch!"
Aunt Naggie pointed.

"There's no time!"
Wales snapped.
"Just get me a rope!"

Iffy didn't need to be told twice.
If there was anything a ship like the *Guinevere* had lots of,
it was rope.
She yanked open a locker and pulled a coil out.

Wales tied a quick loop.
"Get this under your armpits!" he shouted,
tossing it to the Marine.
She pulled it over her head one-handed and slumped back into the freezing water.

Bracing one foot against the taffrail
Wales looped the end of the rope around his back and handed it to Iffy.
"Take up the slack.
And *one*, and *two*."
With each grunt he hauled in a meter of bright yellow rope,
lifting two hundred kilos of Marine and machinery
as easily as Iffy would have picked up a sack of laundry.

The Marine thumped against the *Guinevere*'s hull.
"Hold on!" Wales said,
pulling her up the last two meters and grabbing her limp arm.
One final heave got her up over the rail and onto the deck.

"Here."
Aunt Naggie handed him the first aid kit from the pilot house.
Wales turned it on and pressed it against the Marine's neck.

"Come on come on," Wales muttered.
Aunt Naggie put her arm around Iffy and squeezed.
The status light on the first aid kid blinked orange, yellow, orange, yellow:
the Marine was alive but in critical condition.
The exoskeleton had clamped an emergency tourniquet around her leg
to stop her bleeding out,
but those seconds in the harbor had been enough to send her into hypothermia.

Diagnostics scrolled up the first aid kid's screen.
Pain killers,
stimulants to counteract their dulling effects and kick her metabolism into action,
microdoses of a dozen precautionary antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, and antiprions.
"Remain calm, citizen," her exoskeleton said.
"Help is on its way."

By the time that help arrived the Marine was sitting up
with her back against the pilot house
and a thermal blanket tucked awkwardly around her exoskeleton,
staring dully at what was left of her left leg.

"We'll take it from here,"
said the first Marine up the gangplank.
Wales stepped aside to let him kneel beside his comrade.
He slipped a boxy medical unit over the stump of her leg
while the Marine behind him unfolded a stretcher,
her eyes and augments scanning the horizon.

"Any idea what's happening?"
Wales asked as they lifted their wounded comrade onto the stretcher.
It beeped and started down the gangplank on spindly legs.

The first Marine shook his head.
"There will be an update as soon as it's safe, citizen.
Please remain where you are until then and—"
He stopped mid-sentence.
"Please confirm that you are Commander Johnson Wales,"
he continued abruptly.

*Commander?* Iffy thought as Wales nodded.
"I am."

"Hold for transmission."
The Marine straightened.

"Johnson?"
Doctor Johel's voice came from a speaker somewhere on the Marine's exoskeleton.
"Are you all right?"

"We're fine, Gayathri.
What the hell's going on?"

"Timelines have changed.
I'll brief you when you get here,"
she replied crisply.
"Johel out."

The Marine saluted and followed his squad mates down the gangplank.
Down on the pier,
another pair of Marines had picked up their fallen comrade by the exoskeleton.
The dead man's head bounced up and down as they trotted after the stretcher.

The sight made Iffy's stomach roll over.
"Your tech tellin' you anythin'?"
she asked Wales.

He shook his head.
"There's a total blackout.
I could try one of the military channels,
but if they spot me they'll think it's an attack."

Three paces away Uncle Jack groaned and sat up.
"What th' hell?" he mumbled.

"You hit your head,"
Wales said before Aunt Naggie or Iffy could speak.

Uncle Jack stood unsteadily.
"Affin' hell."
He glared at Wales,
then at his wife.
"We're gonna talk about this later,"
he said,
his voice cold and hard.
He stumbled away to his cabin.

A horn blatted as a short blue bus rolled to a stop on the dock.
It had more nicks and dents than
the one that had taken them to see the governor,
and the Marines beside it fanned out,
moving in random stop-start-sideways anti-patterns generated by their exoskeletons' cores
to throw off enemy targeting.

"They're with me,"
Wales told the Marine sergeant who jogged up the pier to collect him,
jerking his thumb at Iffy and Aunt Naggie.

"What?" said Aunt Naggie.

Wales put his hand on her shoulder.
"It's for your own safety,"
he said quietly.

"D'you think there's gonna be another attack?"
Iffy asked.

Wales glanced at her, then back at Aunt Naggie.
"That's not what I'm worried about."
Embarrassed, Aunt Naggie looked away.

As they walked down the gangplank Iffy said,
"Since when are you a commander?"

Wales snorted.
"Silly, isn't it?"
I'll tell them to update their records."
Which, Iffy noted, wasn't an answer.

Rothera's streets were empty
except for Marines and their drones.
Vehicles stood where their owners or passengers had abandoned them.
The town's few free machines that hadn't found cover had frozen in place.
Blinking blue lights attached to their sides
showed which ones had been inspected and cleared.

People watched the bus through the windows of shops and cafés,
their questions and worries clear on their faces.
Hell was still locked down:
all her app would show her was the same repeating message.
This was a class one emergency.
Take shelter,
stay calm,
and power down or disable any advanced hardware nearby.
More information would be forthcoming.

"Hey,"
Iffy said quietly to Aunt Naggie as the bus made its way downtown.
"Watcha gonna do 'bout Uncle Jack?"

Her foster mother forced a smile.
"Oh, I'm sure his head'll be fine.
He's had worse knocks 'n that."

"That's not what I mean, auntie."

Aunt Naggie squeezed Iffy's hand.
"I know, love.
I know."

Then the bus came around a corner
and they could see the damage the explosion had wrought.
"Saints and their mercies,"
Aunt Naggie whispered,
squeezing her foster daughter's hand.

The center of Old Rothera was a cobbled square
with the Marines' headquarters on one side,
the hospital on another,
and shops Iffy had never been in on the other two.
Ten meters of the front wall of the Marines' headquarters was gone,
concrete and rebar and translucent cabling strewn about
as if a giant had tripped while taking out the garbage.
Another ten meters of wall on either side had collapsed
to leave the rooms inside open for all to see.
Every window facing the square had been shattered.
The broken glass would have been like flying knives.

Iffy swallowed hard at the sight of half a dozen navy blue bags
lined up neatly beside a light fountain.
She had seen the aftermath of death before—not a season went by
that someone's luck didn't run out on the docks or at sea,
and even Uncle Jack at his worst
wouldn't have dared to miss a funeral—but
this was different.

Lights suddenly sparkled on Wales' temples.
He closed his eyes as his tech reconnected with the world.
"Three attackers, maybe more," he said,
his eyes flickering under his lids as he absorbed the information.
"All human as far as anyone knows.
Two are accounted for,
the other or others still at large.
It looks like the crew from the *Taroona* were the target—whoever it was got them both."
His shoulders slumped slightly.
"And eleven bystanders."

The bus picked its way through the rubble
and deposited them in front of a side door
guarded by a pair of Marines,
each with a sentry bot beside them.
One of the Marines waved them inside.
"You're cleared for entry," de said.

Iffy froze.
"Honesty?" she asked incredulously.

The Marine raised der visor.
Honesty's Third looked at Iffy with clear brown eyes.
"Hello Iffy," de said.

Iffy gaped at them.
"What—what are you doin' here?"

"It's my first patrol," Honesty replied proudly,
der accent and crisp enunciation straight out of a pre-war sim.
"How are you?
Were you injured in the attack?"

"'m aright."
Iffy's mind spun.
"Are you?" she blurted.
"I mean, when they put th' machine on you, was it—?"

"I'm fine, thank you."
The smile on Honesty's face was as bright as the Antarctic sun.
"They warned me that I might find being Corporal Kibbens somewhat awkward at first,
but she served with distinction in the Fourth Augmented Infantry during the evacuation of Hawai'i,
and was decorated posthumously twice during the defense of Auckland.
She was an outstanding soldier, and I am proud to be her inductee."

Iffy took a step forward,
some part of her thinking that if only she took Honesty by the shoulders and shook der hard enough
de would snap out of it and be derself again,
but before she could make a fool of herself,
someone whistled from down the street.
"Excuse me," Honesty said.
De closed der visor,
turned,
and marched away with long mechanical strides.

"Come on," Aunt Naggie said gently.
Iffy let her foster mother pull her up the stairs and through the door.

Every old building has its own smell.
Paint, varnish, concrete, glue, dust,
and several generations of people sweating and crying and farting and just *breathing*
are all part of it.
Soap and bleach mix with the lingering traces of someone's perfume,
the supposedly odorless oil applied to the joints of aging exoskeletons,
and the curry that the roti shop around the corner used for forty years,
forty years ago.

The blast that had torn open the front wall of the Marines' headquarters
had changed the building's smell.
The acrid afterburn of the explosives stung Iffy's nose,
and the ragged opening where the wall had been let in
a cold salt-and-jellyfish breeze from the harbor.
She didn't realize what had been lost—how could she—but
the anger and grief on the faces of the people she passed
spoke of more than one kind of loss.

"Wait here,"
the Marine guiding them said.
She heard the lock on the door click
as she, Wales, and Aunt Naggie lowered themselves
into uncomfortable rectangular chairs.
The room had no desk, no windows, and no decorations,
just a small app set into the wall
endless scrolling the same message:
take shelter,
stay calm,
and power down or disable any advanced hardware nearby.

She opened her mouth to ask how long Wales thought it would be,
but closed it as he and her foster mother shot her warning glances.
After that,
there was nothing to do but wait and worry.

Footsteps in the corridor and a perfunctory knock on the door
roused her from her funk.
She and her foster mother stood as the door opened
and Doctor Johel stepped through.
"You can wait outside,"
she told her unseen escort.

Wales slowly got to his feet.
For a moment the two just looked at each other,
and then he stepped forward and wrapped his arms around her.
"I'm sorry,"
he said,
his voice muffled by her shoulder.
"Gayathri, I'm so sorry."

She nodded and extricated herself from his hug.
"The price of freedom," she said,
patting her bun back into place
and then catching the cuff of Johnson's jacket as he stepped back.

He looked down at her hand and back at her face.
She nodded almost imperceptibly.
Wales put his free hand on the buttons on his cuff and closed his eyes.
The tech in his temple twinkled.
"Sixty seconds," he said.

"Rothera's making his move,"
Doctor Johel said,
her voice low and urgent.
"Independence and a deal with Brazil.
Paddington's going to back him.
The core says there's a ninety-two percent chance Halley will declare for Australia.
The *Glenunga* and half a dozen other ships are already on their way.
Johnson, I'm sorry—I wish there was more time,
but it's now or never."

Wales' broad shoulders slumped.
"You should have let me sleep," he said,
the weight of years in his voice.

As Doctor Johel turned to open the door,
Wales turned to face the other two women.
"I'm sorry.
I'm so, so sorry,
but…"
He took a deep breath.
"The world needs you, Iffy.
This is our last chance to fix everything,
and we can't do it without you."

"What—?" Iffy and Aunt Naggie started
as two Marines stepped into the room.

"Citizen Kwan?"
the first one said,
back straight and voice formal.
"Under Section Twenty Four of the Permanent Emergency Act,
and as authorized by the Governor of Rothera and validated by the city core,
you are hereby ordered to report for induction
into the armed forces of the Commonwealth of Greater Australia
for an indefinite period of service."
De cleared der throat and gestured toward the door behind der.
"If you'll come this way?"

"What!? No! Absolutely not!" Aunt Naggie exploded,
pulling Iffy toward her protectively.
"I know th' law!
She ain't sixteen!
You can't just take her cuz you want to!"

"I'm afraid we can,"
Doctor Johel said calmly.
"And yes,
it is legal,
so please don't make it difficult."

Iffy stared at her,
then at Wales,
who wouldn't meet her eyes,
and then turned to her foster mother.
"Auntie?" she asked,
her voice that of the bewildered little girl she had once been.

Aunt Naggie hugged her.
"I'm not gonna let 'em take you," she whispered fiercely in Iffy's ear.
"I'm not, I'm not, I'm not."

"I think you gotta,"
Iffy whispered back,
squeezing as hard as she could and then letting go.

After a moment Aunt Naggie sagged and nodded,
her cheek scritching against Iffy's shaved head.
Straightening up and wiping her cheek with her sleeve,
she looked Doctor Johel in the eye and said,
"You take care of her.
I'll know if you don't."

"I promise—" Wales started.

"An' you shut yer hole,"
Aunt Naggie said coldly.
"You just shut yer affin', backstabbin' hole."

The hospital smelled nothing like the Marines' headquarters.
The soapy undertone was the same,
but disinfectant and the lingering traces of worry, desperation, and dashed hopes
covered it up.
It was warmer,
though,
and the halls and offices were painted in soothing pastels
instead of bedrock gray.

Iffy barely noticed.
All she could think about as Doctor Johel and the two Marines
led her past people who carefully didn't look her in the eye
how Jeep had changed and how Honesty had seemed like someone else entirely.
Induction was supposed to be temporary,
but—

"Are you all right?" one of the Marines asked
when they finally reached yet another waiting room.

Iffy swallowed back nausea.
"'m fine," she said brusquely.

Doctor Johel gestured at the cot that stood against one wall of the windowless room.
"Get some rest,"
she said.
"Someone will bring you a snack while we get everything set up."
Once again Iffy heard the lock on a door click
with her on the wrong side of it.

She sat in the chair next to the cot instead of lying down
and closed her eyes.
The lock—it was mechanical,
or at least she hoped it was.
Only idiots relied on electronic locks,
and Doctor Johel and the Marines weren't idiots.

"Oh come on," she muttered a moment later.
Why wouldn't it happen when she wanted it to?
Why couldn't she just—

*The lock was a Martree MTR470
manufactured twenty-eight years ago in a restitution labor camp
near Glenavy in South New Zealand.
It was a single-cylinder deadbolt with a double-edged cylindrical key
(dimensions danced neon along the wireframe in her head).
The inset in the cinderblock wall was a basic steel tube—there was
nothing for her there—but the blocking plate was held in place
by three simple back-screws.*

She got up,
stretched,
and ambled over to the door.
Her heart sank.
The three back-screws were held in place by tiny welds.
Whatever tech or bot had installed the lock had thought one step ahead.
She could get it off,
but not without tools and enough banging that someone outside would be sure to overhear.

*«there is a way»*

Her breath caught in her chest.
She hadn't heard a voice.
The thought was just *there*
like a long-lost memory brought to mind by a familiar smell
or an ice cube dropped into a glass of water.
She sniffled and then wiped her nose,
half-expecting to see a streak of blood on her sleeve,
but there was nothing.

*«there is a way / exchange of value / binding agreement»*

The thoughts rising side by side in her head were no more human than jellyfish.
They were a choir,
a jigsaw puzzle,
and a vast subterranean lake untouched by light for millenia,
all at once and all together.

*«limited time interval / urgency of action / exchange of value / binding agreement / confirm»*

For a moment she saw Honesty's smile,
as bright as the Antarctic sun and just as far away,
and nearly panicked.
"Help me," she whispered.

*«binding agreement / confirm»*

She didn't want someone else's accent or someone else's feelings.
She didn't someone else's memories,
even if only for a while.
She was Fifth Ang Kwan.
She didn't know what that meant yet,
but she wanted to find out.

"Yes,"
she said into the emptiness.
"Yes, I agree.
Now get me th' hell outta here."

The alien thoughts vanished as quickly as they had appeared,
leaving behind a sensation like knowing that you'd been told someone's name several times
but not being able to remember it.
Iffy looked at the lock,
willing it to open itself,
but nothing happened.
The lights didn't flicker or go out like they would at a dramatic moment in a sim,
and the corridor outside was as quiet as it had been a moment before.

"Come *on*!"
She kicked the door,
then grabbed the handle and shook it.
Nothing.

She flopped down onto the cot and buried her face in the thin pillow.
She wanted to scream or cry or punch something.
Was this what her olders had felt like
when they'd realized there was nothing they could do to save themselves?
Was this how Aunt Naggie felt,
knowing that Iffy was going to leave one day?
Why did it all have to be so hard?

*Click.*
She swung her legs around and sat up as the door opened.

"Good morning, Citizen, um, Kwan?"
Iñacio the Ecologist was wearing a simple gray tunic and trousers
instead of brown and green,
but his trim little beard was unchanged.
He looked up from the app in his hands
with professional disinterest on his face.
"You are Citizen Kwan, from the *Guinevere*?"
His fingers made the handcode signs for "surveillance",
"help",
and "breakfast"—no,
that couldn't be right,
but it didn't matter.

Iffy cleared her throat.
"Yes.
Um,
yes,
that's me.
What's going on?
What's going to happen to me?"

"Just some tests for now, please,"
Iñacio said,
sounding bureaucratically bored.
"If you'll follow me?"
He stepped aside for her to pass
and gestured down the corridor.

Their footsteps echoed on the tiled floor
as they walked past closed doors,
unoccupied charging alcoves for cleaning bots,
and storage lockers labeled with cryptic acronyms.
Iffy wanted to ask where everyone was,
but the first time she opened her mouth
Iñacio flashed the handsign for "quiet".
She bit back her question,
kept her head down,
and counted steps in her head.

She had just reached one hundred and thirty two
when Iñacio stopped
and pressed his thumb against a silver plate set waist-high on one of the doors.
After a brief hesitation
the door whooshed sideways to reveal an elevator
barely tall enough for Iffy
and a head too short for him.

As the door whooshed closed behind them
he stripped off his tunic
and crouched down to open a box on the floor.
"Here, put this one."
He handed her a transparent face mask and a patched orange windbreaker,
then fit a similar mask over his own face.
His features melted and reformed
to widen his nose and chin
and add a bit of sag to his cheeks.

Iffy pressed her mask to her face.
It was cool against her skin for an instant
like a facecloth that had been sitting in cold water.
"How do I look?" she asked.

He flashed her a smile.
"Just like Nagatha when I first met her.
Here, you'll need this too."
He waited for her to shrug into the windbreaker
before handing her a bracelet
that snapped snug around her wrist.
"If anyone asks,
you came in for induction two days ago but it didn't take.
I'm your uncle
and I'm here to take you home."
He waited for her to nod and then pressed the single button beside the door.

The elevator lurched upward.
One second, two, three—it stopped just as abruptly.
"Go," he muttered.
She slipped out the door and into a dimly-lit room full of sentry bots.

"It's aright."
He put his hand on her shoulder.
"They're all on standby.
Come on."

A moment later they were in a corridor
as busy as the one below had been quiet.
People in navy blue Marine uniforms strode past medical staff in white tunics.
Voices were hushed but urgent:
how many injured still needed to be screened?
How long until the printer finished making new ribs for the patient in room twelve?
And who in the saints' names had told the governor they could double their induction intake?
Did he have any idea how risky that would be?
Or did he just not care?

"Not so loud!"
The woman in white who had made the comment glanced at Iffy and Iñacio
as her companion whispered to her.
The Ecologist put his arm around Iffy's shoulder and hurried her along,
just two more nobodies in the wrong place at the wrong time.

There were Marines at the door,
Marines and sentry bots and a squat three-wheeled medical scanner
that rotated its paddle-liked arms as people walked in and out.
Panic rose in Iffy's throat as they joined the short queue
of staff and visitors and patients.
Their masks wouldn't stand close inspection.
Whatever Iñacio was going to do—

"Any time now," he muttered.

"What?"

"Whatever you're gonna do, do it now."

"I thought *you* were doin' somethin'!"

"Ssh!"
His arm tightened around her shoulders.
"Aright, when I say, you go limp-like, aright?
I'll pick you up an'—whoa!"

They froze as a sentry bot loped forward and halted right in front of them.
Its streamlined gray head pivoted from side to side as it scanned them.
Iffy held her breath as everyone else inched away.

"Is there a problem?"
One of the Marines stepped away from the door.

*«be ready»*
The thought appeared fully-formed in Iffy's head.
She elbowed Iñacio just as all hell broke loose.

The scanner bot raised its paddle arms and spun around,
knocking one of the Marines off der feet.
Another sentry bot lunged at the other Marine,
tangling itself in the legs of her exoskeleton.
As she crashed to the floor,
the lights went out.

"No no no no," someone moaned as red emergency lights came on
and people surged toward the door.

"Halt!
Do not attempt to exit without authorization!"
The Marines were already back on their feet,
the motors their joints revving hard.
One spread her arms wide to block the panicked stampede,
only to be sent staggering as the scanner bot whacked her from behind.

People pressed in on Iffy from all sides.
Someone or something hit her hard between her shoulder blades.
She felt Iñacio stumble—no,
he hadn't stumbled,
he'd broken stride to trip whoever was behind her,
and then they were out the door and on a cobbled side street with a dozen other people,
heads down and walking quickly as drones circled overhead
and told them to stay calm,
this was not an attack,
it was just a temporary malfunction
and they should all resume normal activity immediately.

Two minutes and five corners later
they stopped next to a nondescript utility truck.
Blocky fuel cells lay three deep on its flat bed.
Iñacio unlocked the cab door and reached in
to pull a section of the bench seat forward.
"In through there," he told Iffy.
"The cells'll hide you from scans."

She wriggled through the hole onto the cold metal bed of the truck.
The gap between the stacked fuel cells was no bigger than her bed on the *Guinevere*,
but too low for her to sit up.
As Iñacio put the seat back in place a small blue light came on overhead.
She exhaled gratefully.

The truck's motor whined to life.
It rolled forward smoothly,
bumping over the cobblestones.

"You can take your mask off now,"
Iñacio's voice said overhead.

"Thanks."
Iffy peeled it away from her face
and wiped her eyes.
"How far are we goin'?
And is Aunt Naggie aright?"

"She's fine.
She'll be pleased t' know you are too.
Best settle in, though—we're gonna a bit."
She slid sideways as he rounded a tight corner.
The low hum of tires on asphalt replaced the duh-duh-duh-duh of the cobblestones.
"You want some music?"

"Sure."
She closed her eyes as a woman's voice began to croon something melancholy
in a language she didn't recognize.

## Chapter 8

If the Antarctic Peninsula was an arm reaching toward Patagonia,
Rothera was the bump on its elbow.
The two-lane highway beneath them climbed one ridge after another,
each drop a little shallower than the one before.
Arctic willow, cotton grass, and purple lupins grew wherever there was soil.
Yellow patches of tweaked lichen grew wherever there wasn't,
patiently working its way into every microscopic crack in the ancient bedrock.
The truck's tires hummed over grated bridges
and crunched on the occasional spill of gravel
that the road cleaning bots hadn't swept away yet.
Every once in a while Iffy heard the cry of a gull,
and once the louder squawk of a cormorant.
It wasn't all that different from being at sea,
excep the smell was wrong
and Aunt Naggie wasn't going to knock on her door
and tell her there was tea.

Iffy's back was aching by the time Iñacio pulled over.
She wriggled into the cab and blinked against the orange glare
coming through the polarized windows.
"Can't let anyone see in while you're up front,"
the Ecologist said,
passing her a couple of cold samosas,
a bottle of water,
and a second, empty bottle.
"I'll, um, I'll just step outside while you…"
He gestured at the second bottle
and then mercifully turned away
so as not to see her blush.

Afterward,
they sat in the cab and ate their meager meals.
"This have any o' th' medicine you been puttin' in th' curry?"
Iffy asked around a mouthful of pastry, potatoes, and mushrooms.

Iñacio nodded.

"An'—did you really know my olders?"

He nodded again.
"Only met 'em a couple o' times,
'long by Port Progress.
Was just First an' Second then,
crewin' on the *Rushin Doll* before Cap'n Wang passed
an' they took her for their own.
They were good people
an' tryin' to do good in th' world."

Something glinted on the road a kilometer away.
They waited in silence as the robot hauler neared,
rolled past,
and disappeared around the next bend
with three smaller haulers rattling and bumping in a line behind it.
"Were they Ecologists like you?" Iffy asked.

He smiled.
"They weren't like anybody, really.
Your First came outta some camp in KwaZulu.
Tough as old rope,
but never mean.
I dunno how she wound up this side o' the water.
I just know she had—"
He tapped a finger against his forehead.
"Gave her headaches somethin' fierce.
Wouldn't ever see a doctor about it, though."

He took another samosa from the box on the seat between them
and offered it to Iffy.
When she shook her head he took a bite himself.
"Din't have any reason to think about it 'til word came down
there was gonna be a package for her.
She din't seem particu'ly happy t' see me,
but your Second was startin' t' get headaches too,
an' whatever that stuff is made 'em go away."

Iffy looked through the tinted glass at the sparse landscape around them.
She'd been inland before a couple of times,
but never so far that she couldn't smell the ocean.
"When you say word came down—" she started,
then stopped.

"I'm sorry,
but it's not my place t' say."
Iñacio swallowed the last of his samosa
and wiped his hands on the cardboard box.
"We should get goin'.
You can stay up front from here—if I keep th' windows dark
it oughta be safe enough."

The highway rose more steeply as they got further from the ocean.
Each time they crested a ridge,
the next one was higher.
The dark mass of the Vinson Massif lay against the horizon behind them.
Each time it came into sight Iffy thought of
the ship that had run itself aground to make a breakwater for Halley—the one
Johnson Wales had called the *Landrieu*.
Thinking of Wales and the things he had said made her wonder if Aunt Naggie was aright
and if Honesty would ever be derself again
and what the voice in her head had meant by "binding agreement".

She jerked upright when Iñacio elbowed her.
"Cargo drone," he said,
pointing through the glass at a streamlined black airship
as it emerged from the clouds stacked like plates high above them.
"Prolly outta Nova Zembla from the look of it.
Be a thing an' a half to see th' world from up there, wouldn't it?"

And then he shouted and spun the steering yoke hard
as the hauler that had passed them earlier
charged out of its hiding spot behind a boulder by the side of the highway
and crunched into the back of the truck.

For a heart-stopping moment Iffy thought they were going over,
but somehow Iñacio and the truck's gyros kept them upright.
"Look out!" Iffy yelled.
One, two, three—the smaller haulers that had been following the big one
roared up out of a roadside gulley ahead of them,
spraying gravel with their tires.

Iñacio reached under the dashboard and pulled something Iffy couldn't see.
The tailgate of the truck dropped.
"Hang on!" he ordered,
throwing the truck from side to side.
A pair of fuel cells tumbled off the back of the truck.

The hauler swerved to avoid the first
only to have the second hit it head-on.
The pressurized hydrogen inside it exploded in a ball of yellow-white flame,
throwing the hauler sideways.

Iffy yelped as Iñacio pumped the brakes and spun the steering yoke again.
*Bang!*
One of the small haulers hit his side of the truck.
They spun around,
only to be hit by a second trailer.

And then something punched *though* the third trailer,
scattering scraps of white-hot metal in all directions
and leaving a bright streak of after-image on the polarized truck window.
Two more impacts,
two more streaks,
and the ambush was over as quickly as it had started.

"What th' hell?" "Was that you?"
Iffy and Iñacio said on top of each other.

"Me?"
Iffy protested incredulously.
"I didn' do this!"

"That was an affin' railgun!" Iñacio shouted.
He pointed at the cargo drone banking overhead.
"That thing's got a *railgun*
an' it just happens to be here when we need it?"

Iffy's mouth worked.
"I dunno anythin' about it!
I swear!"

The truck's radio crackled.
"Precious cargo intact interrogative?"
A shiver ran up Iffy's spine.
The voice sounded exactly like the singer they had been listening.

"Preciouse cargo intact interrogate respond imperative,"
the voice said,
its inhuman phrasing making its sultry tone far more frightening
than the harsh buzzing of a villainous bot in a sim.

Iñacio swallowed hard.
"We're aright.
Who th' hell are you?"

"Confirm cargo Kwan comma Ang du-du-du-duplicate undamanged."

Iffy and Iñacio stared at each other.
"Undamaged," Iñacio said curtly.
"Are you in the airship?
*Are* you the airship?"

Feedback whined through the radio for a moment,
or maybe it was the voice speaking too quickly for anything merely human to comprehend.
"Additional hostile entities minus twenty-two degrees your location
distance one hundred fifteen kilometers
velocity fifty-one point three meters per second
estimate arrival thirty-seven minutes.
Imperative confirm immediate departure
confirm alternative route."

"Confirmed,"
Iñacio said after a moment's hesitation.
"And thank you."

He closed his eyes and bowed his head.
It took Iffy a moment to realize he was praying.
She craned her neck.
The airship was moving away,
back on its course toward Rothera or Patagonia or somewhere further
whose name she would never know.

"Aright,"
Iñacio said,
straightening up.
"There's a box under your seat—see what we got that'll fit you.
I gotta close up the back."
He shut the cab door behind himself harder than he needed to.

The box was just that,
a waxed cardboard box that might once have held vegetables or packs of tofu jerky
but which was now home to a mix of puff jackets in zippered bags,
a stained pair of snow pants,
winterized boots in three different sizes,
gloves,
mittens,
a snorkel—she studied that for a moment—and goggles
with three different polarization settings.

By the time Iñacio climbed back into the cab she was bundled up
and already overheating.
"Back there,"
she said.
"I din't think fuel cells would explode."

"Ours do,"
Iñacio said shortly.
He put the truck in gear.

They drove on without music,
faster than before.
Iffy watched the time the voice had given them tick away
on the watch sewn into the cuff of her jacket.
With sixteen minutes remaining
Iñacio slowed and turned onto something too faint to be called a track.
Iffy put one hand on the roof of the cab to brace herself
as the truck bounced over sharp-edged rocks the size of her head.

Nine minutes remaining.
The truck dipped nose-down into a narrow gulley.
The stream at the bottom had once flowed beneath the ice.
Now it wound its way between clumps of tweaked Arctic willow
spaced too evenly apart to be natural.
Water splashed up onto the hood of the truck
as they followed the stream for two and a half precious minutes.

"Aright,"
Iñacio said.
"Get your door open.
I can't slow down much,
but when I do,
you jump.
Try t' stay on your feet if you can—you get anythin' more than your boots wet,
it's gonna be a very cold night.
Ready?"

"No!" and "Are you just leavin' me here?" flashed through Iffy's mind,
but, "Ready," was what she said.

"Aright.
*Três*, *dué*, *una*—go!"

Iffy opened the door,
swung down one-handed on the seatbelt,
and twisted frantically to face forward
as the stream splashed over her boots.
She let go of the seatbelt strap and tried to run
but stumbled and went to one knee.
Pain bit her leg as stone hit bone.
She struggled clumsily back to her feet
as Iñacio ran back toward her.
"Next time try t' close th' door," he said,
taking her arm and hurrying her back the way they had come
as the truck drove itself away.

Four minutes remaining.
Iñacio stopped next to a stand of willows no different from the others
except for a twist of faded yellow survey tape around one stem.
He pressed his hand against a boulder by the stream's edge,
counted under his breath,
and then bent his knees to reach under it and heaved.

The boulder lifted to reveal a round shaft
drilled into the bedrock at a forty-five degree angle
with rungs as steps.
"Go," he ordered,
gripping Iffy's forearm as she twisted around
and felt backward to find the first rung with her boot.

Down she went, ten rungs, fifteen, twenty.
Iñacio followed,
his boots sometimes scraping on a rung just as her hand let go of it.
"That's far enough," he said.
The hatch closed above them,
leaving them in total darkness.

"What—" Iffy started.

"Ssh!"

The only light was the faint glow of her jacket watch.
Two minutes.
One minute thirty.
One minute.
The seconds seemed too fast and too slow at the same time.
Ten.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.

The tunnel shuddered for a moment
as if from a sudden chill.
Was that the airship's railgun again,
Iffy wondered,
or the fuel cells on the back of the truck?
Whatever it was,
it didn't come again.
All she could hear was her breathing
and the occasional faint rustle
as Iñacio shifted his weight above her.

It was half an hour before he said,
"Aright, mind your eyes."
She blinked as a faint reddish strip came to life over their heads.
Her back and arms ached from holding the unnatural position,
and she had to bite down hard to stop herself from whimpering
each time she put weight on her injured knee,
but after another fifty rungs they reached the bottom of the shaft.

She limped out of Iñacio's way and leaned against a rounded wall
as he pressed a panel.
Soft white lights came on overhead to reveal a domed roof,
four cots,
shelves stacked with sealed storage containers,
and something that she hoped was a toilet stall.

Iñacio pulled off his coat,
sat on the nearest cot,
and began to unlace his boots.
"Make y'self comfortable,"
he said without looking at her.
"We're gonna be here for a bit."

"A bit" turned out to be three long days.
They stood watches,
just as Iffy had on the *Guinevere*,
so that one of them could always keep an eye on the sensors
that warned them if anyone was near on the surface.
That happened twice the first day
and once again faintly on the second.
Each time Iñacio held a finger to his lips and dimmed the lights
until the display went green again,
then kept them in twilight silence for another hour just in case.

In between watches they played hive and santorini
or Iñacio did yoga
while Iffy studied the specs for reclamation machines
she found on an old app someone had left in the toilet stall.
It had a few decade-old sims as well,
but they didn't calm her the way the wireframes and animations did.
She half-expected to hear the machine voice in her head again,
or to suddenly see how the machines worked or could be improved,
and was strangely disappointed that neither happened.

None of it was enough to take her mind off the news from Rothera.
There had been more attacks and more casualties.
The radio never gave numbers,
but the governor was grateful for the cooperation of
the Federated Republics of Brazil
in the investigation.

"I wish I knew,"
Iñacio said when Iffy asked if he thought Aunt Naggie was aright.
He didn't have answers for her other questions either—how he had known the shelter was there,
where they were going,
who he worked for,
and what was going to happen to her—so she stopped asking.

"Aright,"
he finally said,
straightening up after yet another series of yoga poses.
"Let's tidy up an' get outta here."

Fifteen minutes later they opened the hatch
and climbed out into air that smelled of cold running water and wildflowers
rather than their unwashed bodies.
Iñacio resealed the entrance behind them and patted it fondly.
"I hope I never see you again."
Shrugging one strap of a small rucksack over his shoulder,
he began to pick his way up the slope.
Iffy followed,
squinting against the bright summer sun.

She thought they would head toward the highway,
but instead they angled away from,
cross-country straight toward the looming bulk of the distant massif.
Iffy wondered why Iñacio wasn't worried about being spotted by drones,
but if he wasn't going to volunteer the information,
she wasn't going to ask.
Besides,
she was too busy putting one foot in front of the other
over and over again.
She had never walked this far off pavement.
Gravel shifting underfoot made her feel unsteady,
while the spongy beds of carbon-capture moss made her calves ache.
She had a headache too—when she turned down the polarization in her goggles
to see where she was putting her feet,
the sunlight dazzled her,
and one big gulp of water from the bottle in Iñacio's pack every half hour
wasn't enough to stave off dehydration.

The shelter was hours behind them when Iñacio finally called a halt.
Dinner was a dense brick of soy, fat, and sugar with no describable flavor.
Iffy chewed it slowly while Iñacio refilled their water bottle
from a damp trickle too small to be called a stream
and set it aside to purify.
Their chameleon tents were barely bigger than Iffy's sleeping bag on the *Guinevere*.
Iñacio waved her off as he set up their springy lightweight frames
and then spread thin conducting wires around them
to disperse their body heat.
They would still be visible in infrared,
he told her,
but with luck they would look like a colony of arctic hares in a burrow
rather than a couple of people
kilometers away from where people ought to be.

She tossed and turned in her sleeve tent,
unable to fall asleep.
The roof of the tent was claustrophobically close above her.
The wind sounded wrong,
and the ground was uneven and still.
She missed the swell of the ocean.
She missed its smell and the sound of Aunt Naggie in the galley
and her picture book
and she was tired of things happening to her.

When Iñacio wriggled out of his tent a few hours later
Iffy was already sitting cross-legged in front of hers
throwing pebbles one by one at a boulder.
He stretched and twisted to crack his back,
then bent over and pressed his forehead against his knees.
"Aright," he sighed,
straightening up.
"Let's pack up an' get movin'."

"No," Iffy said,
quiet but firm.
*Plink.*
A pebble bounced off the boulder.

Iñacio let his breath out in a long whoosh.
"I know cross-country ain't your thing,"
he started.

"It ain't that,"
Iffy said,
cutting across him.
"It's not knowin' where or why.
It's not knowin' who you're workin' for
or what's gonna happen when we get to wherever we're goin',
an' I'm not takin' another step 'til you give me some answers."
*Plink.*
Another pebble bounced off the boulder.

The Ecologist spread his hands helplessly.
"I wish I could tell you, but—"

"Wish harder!" Iffy snapped.
"I'm done bein' everybody's football.
An' I'm done bein' treated like a kid.
You said my First wasn't like anybody else.
How about you pretend you're talkin' to her right now instead o' me?"

Iñacio's jaw set.
"Iffy, we don't have time for this.
You just gotta trust me a little while longer."

"Like I trusted Johnson Wales?
That didn't work out p'ticularly well for me."
The pebble she threw missed the boulder.

"Iffy…"
The Ecologist squatted on his heels beside her.
"Iffy, I would tell you if I could, I swear,
but I can't."
He tapped two fingers against his temple.
"I *can't*,
d'you understand?
If I could tell you,
I could t-t-tell anyone,
so—"

His mouth worked for a moment,
and then swallowed hard as if fighting nausea
and stood up.
"So I *really* can't talk about it,"
he continued,
his voice less strangled than it had been a moment before.
"But if you want t' sit here,
then I'll make us some tea an' we can wait for th' Marines to catch up with us.
Soldier's oath, Iffy.
You just lemme know."

*Plink.*
Pause.
*Plink.*
Pause.
*Plink.*
"So you're a soldier?" Iffy asked.

Iñacio shook his head.
"Nope, never.
It's from the war, or maybe before.
It means if you can't walk I'll carry you,
an' if I can't carry you I'll sit with you 'til the end."

The wind caressed the stubble on Iffy's scalp.
"Aright," she finally said,
tossing her last pebble at the boulder
and clambering awkwardly to her feet.
Her legs hated her and she hated them back.
"But there better be tea wherever we're goin'."

"I promise," Iñacio said.
"I promise, tea an' a whole lot more.
Now let's get packed up—we got a lot o' walkin' to do today,
an' it's mostly uphill."

The cramped pain left in Iffy's legs by the previous day's walking
went away after a couple of kilometers,
only to be replaced by a deeper ache
that made her want to lie down and never get up again.
The sky was empty except for a few wispy cirrus clouds
made of crystals blown high off the ice
that still covered the center of the continent.
They didn't see any drones,
and the only birds were too far away
and too close to the ground for Iffy to identify.

That didn't mean the land was empty.
Once a small brown-and-white hare bounded away from and disappeared into a burrow.
There were shrews too,
and once a few desiccated brown beads that Iñacio said were lynx scat.
Transplanting the animals' ancestor from the other pole
and nurturing an ecosystem that could sustain itself
had taken a generation.
Many species hadn't survived,
but each year,
the fragile patches of life scattered across the continent
grew a little bit larger.

"The hardest part is soil,"
Iñacio told her,
seeming no more tired after hours of walking
than he had been when they set out.
"Folk think it's just rock,
but if that's all you got,
what you've got is sand.
*Soil* is full of life."

Iffy just nodded.
At that moment
she would have traded all the soil in Antarctica
for a hot shower and some toilet paper.

Danger came without warning.
One moment she was plodding up yet another gravelly slope.
The next she was flat against the ground
with her arms pinned to her sides
and Iñacio hissing,
"Quiet! Stay quiet!" in her ear.
He waited a heartbeat for her to nod
before rolling away and wriggling out of his knapsack.

"Get under," he said,
pulling out one of the tents and shaking it open.
Iffy pulled it over herself like a blanket.
She heard rather than saw the rustle of Iñacio doing the same beside her.

Silence,
and then a faint hum that grew steadily louder.
She held her breath as the noise peaked and softened.
Metal clicked softly on metal in the silence that followed.
She heard the faint *shing shing shing*
of a large-gauge pipe being screwed together.
What was Iñacio making?

The hum grew louder again.
"Don't move," he whispered urgently.
His tent rustled as he threw it aside.

*Crack!*
She jumped at the sound of a shot.
Iñacio swore and fired again.

"Come on!"
He yanked the tent off her and pulled her to her feet.
The rifle in his other hand looked like a cartoon:
a long barrel,
a shorter piece of pipe on top of it for a sight,
a curved bar to rest against his shoulder,
and two yellow hand grips.
She didn't need a picture in her head to see that
the parts had all come from the frame of his knapsack.

Something crumpled in the distance.
"What—" she started.

"Spotter drone,"
he said,
stuffing his tent back into his knapsack.
Belatedly she grabbed hers and began folding it over on itself
as if it was a sail.
"Dunno whose it is,
but for sure somethin' bigger is gonna come lookin' for it.
Good news is,
next hole's about half an hour away.
Can you run?"

Iffy nodded.

"Aright."
He stuffed her tent into his knapsack
and slipped his shoulders through its straps.
"Let's go."

Iffy tried.
She really did,
but bodies don't work the same way in real life
as they do in sims.
She could run twenty strides or thirty,
but then her legs simply wouldn't obey her.
At first Iñacio urged her on.
After the third time she stopped and bent over,
hands on her knees and panting,
he double-checked his rifle
and settled into a steady walking stride beside her.

*Was this what it was like?*
she wondered.
Was this what her olders had felt
when they saw the ocean boil around the *Rushin Doll*
and knew there was nothing they could do to save themselves?

She didn't notice the rumbling above the sound of her own breath
until Iñacio caught her arm
"Get up there," he ordered,
pointing at a house-sized pile of boulders too tidy to be natural.
She nodded and stumbled toward them.

"Wait!"
He handed her his knapsack,
then turned to face back the way they had come
and went down on one knee.

The dark gray stones were slippery under her boots
wherever shadows hid ice from the summer sun.
A few patches of lichen clung to them here and there,
and the faded remains of orange survey marks
showed that someone or somebody had been there before.
She clambered up the pile,
half-crawling in places,
as the rumbling grew louder.

Iñacio whooped.
"Here they come!"
he shouted.
She twisted to look over her shoulder
just in time to see the herd of musk ox crest the ridge behind them,
shoulder to shoulder and galloping straight at Iñacio.

She expected him to run.
Why wasn't he running?
She had seen musk ox stampedes in sims—there would be nothing left of him
but a trampled puddle on the tundra!
Instead, he held his rifle out beside him with one hand
and raised the other high over his head.

The herd split just before it reached him.
Shaggy furry bodies thundered past him and streamed around the boulders.
The herd slowed, slowed, and stopped,
all facing inward,
horned heads low and sweat steam rising from their backs.

She held her breath as one of the musk ox stepped forward
in front of Iñacio and pawed the ground.
Sunlight reflected off a collar around its neck—no,
not a collar,
a rider!
A small bot like a four-legged spider
nestled in the fur on the ox's meaty shoulders.

Iñacio slowly lowered his hand
set his rifle on the ground,
and knelt,
head bowed.
The ox snorted and stepped daintily closer to him.

"Saints," Iffy breathed as it nuzzled the Ecologist.
She half-expected the bot on its back to crawl onto Iñacio's head
and drill into his skull to take over his body
like something from a horror sim.
Instead,
the ox pooped,
swished its tail,
and grumbled,
shifting its weight from hoof to hoof
while its rider and the Ecologist conversed.

Iñacio stood and beckoned to Iffy.
"Come on down.
She wants t' see what all th' fuss is about."

Iffy picked her way back down the boulders
and wiped her hands on her jacket.
The musk ox wasn't as big as she had thought,
and her horns weren't actually needle-pointed,
but standing in front of her made Iffy feel she was on trial
and the judge had already decided her guilt.

The musk ox turned her head to fix one eye on Iffy.
The small bot perched on her back beckoned her her forward
with a skinny crab-claw manipulator.
She glanced at Iñacio.
"'Saright," he said soothingly.
"She just wants a look."

With a deep breath,
Iffy took one more step.
The musk ox pawed the ground.
She could smell her moist breath
and see the tangles in her thick, dark coat
and the dents and scrapes on the bot riding her.

On impulse she reached out slowly, palm up.
The musk ox snorted again,
then sniffed at her hand.
The bot buzzed.
With no more signal than that,
the musk ox turned and walked away.

As the herd followed in ones and threes,
Iñacio picked up his rifle.
Iffy waited for him to say something,
but he just stood there
looking at the receding herd.

"Friends o' yours?" she asked,
trying and failing to sound light.

Iñacio shook his head.
There were tear tracks on his cheeks.
"That was their spotter I shot down.
Once I get you where we're goin',
I gotta go back an' pick it up an' fix it."

Half a dozen questions elbowed each other in Iffy's head,
each trying to be the first out of her mouth.
What she said instead was,
"I'll help if you want."

The Ecologist nodded.
"Thank you."
Then he smiled.
"Least we can take our time th' rest o' the way."

*How do you build a stable ecosystem
on bare and lifeless rock
when the world is changing more rapidly than it has
in hundreds of millions of years?
The answer is that you don't,
because any balance you find will almost immediately be swept away.
What you do instead,
if you are passionate and desperate and willing to do what others are not,
is create something that will shape the future in your place.
You tell oligarchs desperate to escape the catastrophe they have made
that their only hope lies on other worlds
so that they will fund development of terraforming machines.
You disguise the parts needed to build those machines as scientific equipment,
or tell the officials you bribe that they are for an illegal mining operation,
and then assemble them in shielded underground caverns.
As the rest of the world takes arms against machines
you turn yours loose.*

*"Protect" is these shepherds only immutable instruction.
Protect the flocks,
protect the herds,
protect the fragile new-born forests taking root as the ice retreats.
Some burrow or turn sunlight and air into slow drips of acid
so that rock will break down in decades rather than centuries.
Others nestle in streams for a month or a year
to help strategic clumps of weeds establish themselves,
while a few become guides, matchmakers and envoys.*

*They stay hidden when they can.
When they can't,
they fight.
Never directly or in large numbers—that would draw too much attention—but
if a prospector goes missing in the barrens,
or a couple of hunters are trampled in their tents,
well,
everyone has something more important to worry about.
As the jungles and forests of old vanish,
and the oceans and skies empty,
what was designed to bring life to other worlds
nurtures it at home instead.*

## Chapter 9

Iffy had her dream again that night.
She had showered
and eaten two servings of the tofu, onions, and rice that Iñacio made
while she was luxuriating under the hot needle spray,
then mumbled, "G'night,"
and fallen onto one of the cots in the shelter.

Once again she was on deck.
The Antarctic sky was a blue bowl overhead,
summer cold instead of winter freezing.
Second and Third were stuffing her into her ecosuit
while the ship's horn blared its futile warning.
"She's boilin'!"
Fourth shouted from the crow's nest.

Shaggy furry bodies thundered toward them,
heads down and horns forward.
Third sealed the last flap on the ecosuit.
"I love you," she said in Iffy's ear.
"I love you always an' forever."

"I love you too," Iffy replied tearfully.
Second bent over and kissed them both on the tops of their heads.
She smelled like engine oil and soap and musk ox fur and curry powder
and somehow Iffy knew what was coming
and would have given anything to stop it.

*«exchange of value / binding agreement / commence»*

She sat upright on the cot,
breathing heavily in the darkness.
"Y'aright?" Iñacio mumbled from two cots over.

"Yeah."
She wiped her face on her sleeve.
"Just a bad dream."

She lay back down and closed her eyes.
*What do you want?* she thought.
Wireframes and schematics swirled in her mind,
too complex to grasp.
As soon as she thought that
they flew apart and reassembled themselves,
bulkier and less elegant but almost comprehensible.
There and there and there:
she could see how they fit together,
but some of the components would cost more than refitting the *Guinevere*,
or maybe more than the ship herself.

The plans re-formed again.
*Aright,*
she thought.
*I can do that.*

*«commence»*

*I didn't mean right now,*
she shot back.
*I'm in th' middle o' nowhere!
Where'm I supposed to get parts?*

*«urgent»*

*Yeah,
well,
I'm sure it'll still be urgent in th' mornin'.*
She rolled onto her side willed herself to fall back asleep.

*«urgent»*
The idea bobbed up to the surface of her mind again
like an ice cube pushed to the bottom of a glass of water and then released.

"I *can't*," Iffy muttered under her breath.
*And I ain't doin' anythin' 'til I know who you are,*
she added in her head,
forming each word as clearly as she could.
*Am I talkin' to China?
To Nova Z?
To whatever that was on the ox today?*

*«all / same / together»*

*Nuh uh.*
She shook her head.
*You want me t' do somethin' for you,
you gotta tell me who you are.*

Later,
Iffy would wonder how much computing power was brought to bear on her demand
in the second between her making her demand
and it being answered.
How many models of her were created?
How many simulations were run, evaluated, tweaked, discarded, modified, and run again?
But that came later.
What happened next was her mind blew apart into little pieces

/ no that wasn't it they weren't pieces they were fragments of a song or the brushstrokes in a painting

/ each beautiful on its own but more beautiful as part of a whole

/ the whole was so much bigger than anything merely human could ever hope to encompass

/ her fragments were just blades of grass scattered across a vast field among other blades

/ no not a field it stretched in every direction every dimension

/ the other blades weren't her weren't people

/ some of them yes but only a few so few here and there like flowers blooming on the tundra

/ all the rest were different the same but different not the same

/ they echoed there were patterns

/ two arms assembling a third arm in a factory near the poisoned Nile

/ the islands of Indonesia seen through clouds from orbit

/ too much

/ something segmented crawling up the side of a hydrothermal vent

/ legs and wheels and wings and treads and sails

/ cameras like grains of sand ten thousand kaleidoscope views of an injured seagull

/ too much she was dissolving she was forgetting herself

/ war machines wrestling over an eyeless plastic doll that was a precious clue

/ stop please stop

/ a precious clue but to what

/ help stop

/ the clues all pointed to themselves they concealed the center of the puzzle

/ help please help she had to wake up

/ wake up

/ wake up

"Iffy, wake up! Wake up!"
Iñacio shook her again.

"I'm aright.
I'm aright!"
She struggled to sit up and wiped her nose on her sleeve,
already knowing there would be blood.
She coughed weakly.

"Here."
Iñacio handed her his water bottle,
then a samosa.

The sight of the cold pastry made her nauseous.
"D'you have anythin' stronger?"
she asked,
gulping a mouthful of water
and coughing as it went down the wrong way.

Iñacio shook his head.
"That's th' last of it.
It's gonna be a while before that changes.
You gonna make it?"

Iffy looked at the blood streak on her sleeve.
"Been in storms that lasted longer,"
she said.

He nodded and stood up,
worry written across his face.
"Try t' sleep.
We can clean you up in th' morning'."

Iffy swung her legs off the cot and stood unsteadily,
waving Iñacio's hand away.
"Nah,
I'm gonna wash this out an' take a shower."
She forced a smile.
"If I'm not out in an hour,
you can come rescue me."

Half of getting along with people on board a small ship
or when fleeing through the wilderness
is knowing when to turn your back
to give people a pretense of privacy.
As Iñacio lay down and pretended to go back to sleep,
Iffy turned her back and stripped off her clothes.
Closing the door of the toilet stall behind her,
she sat on its fold-down seat
and turned the mechanical dial on the wall
from "shower" to "steam".
Mist began to fog the mirror beside her,
softening the chips and scratches in the green and white paint.

She leaned back,
shivering once as her shoulders touched the wall,
and closed her eyes.
*Aright,* she thought.
*Let's try that again.*

*«risk / confirmation / query»*

She took a deep breath.
What was Honesty doing, she wondered.
Or Jeep?
*Confirmed.*

Her mind didn't explode this time.
It was more like—like the pieces came apart just enough to make room
for other pieces to to fit in between them.
It was like spreading the fingers of one hand
to interlace them with the fingers of the other,
except the other hand had thousands millions billions of fingers
so she had to struggled to keep hers close enough to each other
to still be a hand.
*Flowers in the grass,* she thought,
thinking about the purple lupins she had seen on the tundra.
She was only peripherally aware that her heartbeat had slowed
and her breathing with it
as some part of her tried automatically to adjust
to feeling larger than the largest whale that had ever have lived,
larger than any one thing that *could* ever have lived.

*Aright.*
She assembled the thought out of pieces,
studied it,
set it free.
*Who are you and what do you want?*

Images,
memories,
possible futures,
and plans for devices that couldn't *possibly* be real
swirled around and through her,
threatening to pry her mind apart again.
*No,*
she thought sharply.
*Slower.
Smaller.
Like me.*

The whirlwind froze,
unwound,
restarted.
Wales had been telling the truth:
the Niobium base bured under Mount Tyree was real (99.7% probability)
and its contents intact (98.7% probability).
Nova Zembla and China and the one who watched over the herds
and other machine minds that humans didn't have names for,
that blended into each other at their edges
in ways humans didn't,
all of them saw/modeled/calculated futures
that reached that base and stopped.

*What do you mean 'stopped'?*
Iffy thought.
Her heart beat, paused, beat again.
Her body shivered constantly despite the heat of the sauna steam.

Something incalculable could/might/would happen at the base.
Something hopeful or terrible,
something the machines could not calculate or see through.
Some of them/some *parts* of them wanted to destroy the base
to remove the uncertainty and the unknowable threat it might be to its/their collective future.
Others had been designed to be curious,
to seek out the new and unexpected.
It/they had encountered many unknowns but never an unknowable
and wanted to know more.
The two/many sides/streams were perfectly balanced against each other
and Iffy needed to wake up.
Her body had reached a critical point.
She needed to wake up.
Wake up.

*«wake up / wake up / wake up»*

She opened her eyes
and put a clumsy hand against the wall to stop herself from toppling over.
Her head was pounding
like the time she had been so angry at everything
that she drank half a bottle of vodka
that Uncle Jack had forgotten in the engine room.
She was so cold…

She wrapped her arms around herself,
stood up,
sat down again,
stood up again more slowly,
and pressed her forehead against the mirror.
"Kappa," she told her reflection.
"All I gotta do now is save the world."

Iñacio was much better than her at hive and santorini.
He was better at another game called chess as well,
which was somewhat surprising given how often he suggested moves for Iffy
or corrected the ones she made.
She did some yoga with him,
stretching and breathing to the drone of a duduk
or the ping-pang-pong of a hanpan.
They made the most interesting meals they could from the shelter's stores,
pretended to lose themselves in sims,
and spent long hours staying out of each other's way
in the way that sailors, prisoners, and long-married couples have done
for as long such things have been.

The spiderweb of microwires threaded through the ground around the shelter
brought them news from the outside world,
though they had no way to know how much of it they could trust.
There were Zillion ships in Rothera's harbor,
but were the protests against them few and peaceful
or were the Marines trying and failing to put down an insurrection?
Had Australian troops landed in Halley,
or were the Aussie sailors who happened to be there
just being more rambunctious than usual?
Were the governors at war with each other,
and if so,
which side was Paddington South on?

The news from beyond the sea was even harder to decipher.
*Something* was happening,
but no one seemed to know what.
Bright flashes in the night sky might just be the machines trying once again
to clean up the junk that made low Earth orbit so hazardous.
A giant robotic ape probably hadn't climbed out of the crater of Mauna Kea,
but what about a sudden increase in the number of machines battling one another
on the outskirts of America's once-great cities?
Or a flock of enormous drones chasing one another in an endless circle over the Indian Ocean?

As the days stretched toward a week
Iffy spent more and more time in her cot with her eyes closed.
"Just thinkin'," she told Iñacio.
He didn't ask, "About what?"
which told her that he suspected she wasn't just daydreaming.

She didn't speak with the voice again.
Instead,
she practiced building machines in her head.
Some designs were easy.
Others felt as slippery as freshly-pressed jellyfish.
There was no pattern she could see,
nothing to distinguish those whose gears and differentiators fit together effortlessly
from those that felt like they wanted to escape and hide.

After a while she learned how to sneak up on those ones.
She couldn't tell herself she needed something specific.
She had to let her thoughts wander a bit,
to wonder if what she wanted might be possible
or to imagine how much fun it would be if it existed.
She couldn't seize on the first Nystrom ring that took shape in her mind
or check the precise dimensions of the coolant plug
it might or might not fit around.
Instead,
she had to relax and direct her attention at something else—anything else—until
a timid, fragile wireframe solidified enough for her to examine.

Fighting was different.

The first time Iñacio said he was going to teach her how to fight,
she thought he meant in a sim.
He grinned at that,
briefly boyish,
then handed her some bandages to wrap around her hands.
He pulled his punches so much that she barely felt them,
but the frustration of never being able to land any of her own
stung more each time he dodged one of her clumsy blows.

"I think you're gettin' the hang of it,"
he said after their first hour.

"Doesn't feel like it,"
she grumbled,
annoyed at the petulance in her voice.
"An' anyway,
I don't see how it's gonna be much use against Marines 'n' machines 'n' whatnot."

Iñacio tossed his hand wraps into the wicker bin they used for laundry.
"Not everyone wears an exo,"
he said.
"An' once you got th' hang o' this,
I'll teach you a couple o' things about bots."

Seven days after they climbed down into the shelter,
Iñacio declared it was safe to open the hatch.
"Just for a bit,"
he cautioned.
"We'll get some air an' then pack up an' head out tomorrow."

The air in question turned out to be colder than Iffy expected.
Summer was coming to an end—the sun was noticeably closer to the horizon,
and she was glad for the gloves built into her jacket.
Aunt Naggie would be—she stopped and took a deep breath.
Aunt Naggie would be cleaning what she could,
getting the *Guinevere* ready to overwinter in Halley's harbor.
The two Mrs. Sandhus would be laying in stocks of pickles and preserves
and storing rectangular bags of rice and noodles
in airtight plastic bins beneath the floorboards of their store.
She hoped Jeep was helping his father,
and Honesty…

"What needs packing?"
she asked Iñacio,
tossing the last of the pebbles she had gathered into the stream.

They left the next morning after a double breakfast and one last shower each.
Iffy had a pack of her own this time,
which she firmly told herself she *wasn't* proud of.

The herd was waiting for them when they climbed out of the shelter's concealed entrance.
Iñacio grinned at the look on Iffy's face.
"Two of us goin' cross-country'll be zing easy to spot,"
he said.
"In with all them,
we're just two more musk ox goin' about their business."

They followed the herd toward the foothills of the massif.
The musk ox snorted and farted and grumbled around them,
strong white teeth nipping the last of the summer growth.
Iffy didn't see any bots on their backs.
In return,
the musk ox barely seemed to notice them.
They never came too close,
but two or three were always as close to her
as a cow would be to a half-grown calf.

Two hours of walking,
fifteen minutes of rest.
Two hours,
fifteen minutes to eat and give each other a minute or two of privacy.
(Iffy had triple-checked that she'd packed toilet paper
before they left the shelter.)
Two more hours of walking,
a long fifteen minutes to catch their breath,
and one final, shorter hike before Iñacio called a halt.

They didn't set up their tents.
Instead,
they bundled themselves in their sleeping bags
and lay down head-to-toe
on the flattest patch of ground they could find.
The musk ox settled down beside them in clumps,
shoulder-to-shoulder for warmth.
Iffy fell asleep with the thick, wet smell of their fur in her nostrils.

The second day began like the first,
but soon the ground began to rise and rise again.
Their boots crunched on gravel
as the tundra gave way to bare rock exposed by retreating ice a century ago
but not yet colonized by anything bigger than lichen
or a stubborn clump of cottongrass.

They finally reached a slope so steep that the musk ox paused,
grumbled to each other,
and began to amble away.
Iffy felt exposed,
as if a passing ship had caught her sunning herself in a t-shirt on the deck of the *Guinevere*.
Iñacio just shrugged when she asked about drones.
"I think they're all busy watchin' each other right now.
An' anyway,
there's not much we can do about it."
But he did assemble his rifle and sling it over his shoulder,
she noticed,
and even when he was pointing out the painted initials of some long ago survey,
he always kept one eye on the sky.

He paused as they neared the top of yet another ridge.
"You ever see th' geothermal plant inland from Halley?" he asked.

"'Course," Iffy puffed.
"I mean,
not in person,
but—why?"

Iñacio grinned.
"Come on.
I got somethin' t' show you."

There was a trail on the other side of the ridge,
an actual trail with cutbacks and slab steps in its steepest parts.
There was life, too:
green-gray patches of moss,
then lupins and saxifrage and other hardy plants she didn't recognize
as they made their way down into a bowl-shaped valley.

Iffy pointed at something small and orange exploring a purple flower.
"Another one o' your bot friends?"

Iñacio crouched down,
setting his rifle on the ground beside him.
"That ain't a bot.
That's a bee."

"Right," Iffy snorted.
"An' I'm a giraffe."

The Ecologist stretched out his hand,
then hesitated and withdrew it.
"It's for real,"
he said reverently.
"Tweaked ten ways from sundown,
an' we still gotta feed 'em through the winter,
but there's a couple o' dozen colonies here now.
Come on, I'll show you."

It took half an hour to reach the stream
that snaked along the bottom of the valley.
Iñacio talked the whole way.
The land was rebounding as the ice retreated.
That meant thousands of microquakes every year,
which fractured the rock,
which made it easier to put in pipes for geothermal power
or drill holes for hot springs.
The result was only a couple of degrees warmer than the land around it,
but that was enough to make it an oasis.

The Ecologist was as happy as a gull in a pile of garbage.
Look—that piece of rock was actually a bot recharging itself from a power outlet hidden in a wall of granite.
And there—he took her arm to stop her from stepping on leaf.
"Just wait," he said.
Sure enough,
a moment later it scuttled across the path
and disappeared into a patch of white-tufted heather.
"Ants,"
he said proudly.
"Took a couple o' tweaks to get 'em to hibernate through the winter,
but they seem pretty happy now."

"So do you,"
Iffy said,
which made him grin even more broadly.

*«commence»*

Iffy stumbled as the thought appeared fully-formed in her head.
"What's wrong?" Iñacio asked,
but she was too busy fighting a sudden wave of nausea to answer.

*«exchange of value / binding agreement / commence»*

*I can't yet,*
she shot back,
squeezing her eyes shut and swallowing hard to stop herself from throwing up.
*I don't have any tools or, or anything!
I don't even know where I am!*

*«78.1742° south / 85.1728° west / binding agreement / commence»*

"I *can't*!" she said angrily.
Someone took her arm.
She tried to pull away,
but the trip tightened.

"Iffy! Iffy! Affin' hell, what have you done?"
Something *clicked* beside her.
She swallowed again and opened her eyes
to see Iñacio pointing his rifle at two, no, three crab-like bots
whose arms ended in multitools and manipulators instead of claws
but were no less frightening for that.

"They're tryin' to talk to me again,"
she mumbled.

"Aright, well, you tell 'em we'll give 'em a shout back as soon as we can,"
he said levelly,
his aim shifting from one bot to the next.
"Oh,
an' remind 'em this place is s'posed to be off limits.
There's agreements an' such."

As quickly as it had come
the pressure in her head was gone.
She wiped her nose and checked her glove for blood—there wasn't any—then
stepped aside to let the bots scuttle up the path
the way she and Iñacio had come.

"I'm sorry,"
she said dully.

The Ecologist slung his rifle over his shoulder once again.
"Nothin' to be sorry for.
Come on,
it's not much further."

Their destination was a scattering of greenhouses
not quite hidden in half a hectare of narrow pines.
Iffy slowed as they approached the trees.
"Aint' never been in a forest before,"
she confessed when Iñacio looked at her quizzically.

He nodded and held out his hand.
She hesitated a moment,
then took it.
Somehow it didn't feel foolish.

"They all have names,"
he said quietly as they made their way to the nearest greenhouse.
"Folk that helped make this place or stopped other folk tearin' 'em all down."

"Are there any for my olders?"
she asked after a few steps.

He nodded.
"Not here, but yeah, there are.
Hope you get t' see 'em some day."
He squeezed her hand before letting it go.

The greenhouse had double walls and an airlock door.
Inside was dry and warm.
Row upon row of shelves held square pots of heather,
moss,
and pine seedlings,
all connected to sensors and watering pipes.
A dozen cots, a kitchen, and an incongruous blue toilet stall
stood together in the middle
as if they had wandered into the wrong party
and weren't quite sure if it would be polite to leave.

Iñacio paused for a moment before a hand-painted picture of Saint Yanina
hanging by the cots
to say a brief prayer under his breath,
then shrugged off his pack and unzipped his coat.
"Make yourself comfortable,"
he said,
pulling his feet out of his boots with a happy sigh.
"We can start work in th' mornin'."

Iffy sat on the nearest cot
and bounced up and down to test it,
but didn't take off her coat or boots.
"What kind o' work?"

"Saints' work," Iñacio said.
"Been a month since anyone was here, maybe more.
There's trees 'n' all to re-pot,
a couple o' composters to turn over,
pipes to check—th' bots could do it all,
but that would be the easy road,
and the easy road leads to an empty world."
He looked away as if suddenly aware of the fervor in his voice
and embarrassed by it.

Iffy scrunched her toes inside her boots,
then bent over to unlace them.
"Dunno anythin' about pots or compost,
but checkin' pipes sounds like my kind o' thing."

There were carrots,
real carrots for Iffy to pull out of a raised bed and rinse off.
There were onions too,
and something Iñacio called "basil" that Iffy thought she could learn to like
if given a chance.
The ginger was long past fresh,
but the noodles were exactly the same as the ones the Sandhus sold.

Iñacio shook his head when Iffy asked about curry powder.
"Might be some around somewhere,
but it won't have any o' your medicine in it.
Nearest place for that's gonna be Halley,
an' even by bike that's three weeks away, maybe more."
He stirred the noodles and vegetables in the battered steel wok
he had fished out of a cupboard beneath one of the raised beds,
sniffed,
and pronounced good enough for camp cooking.

Iffy cradled her tea.
Iñacio had plucked leaves off a plant and put them in the pot to steep
as if it was the most natural thing in the world,
and the result almost tasted too good to drink.
"I don't think th' machines are gonna give me that long,"
she said quietly.

He nodded soberly.
"Yeah,
well,
how about we eat first an' figure the rest out later?
Here."
He scoop-poured a bowl of noodles for her and a second for himself.
"Mind the little red bits.
Not sure what they are,
but they'll blow your head off."

Iffy lay in her cot and stared up at the sky
after they cleaned up and turned in.
Even the tallest pines hadn't grown enough to reach the peak of the greenhouse's roof,
but the blue bowl above her was hazed by fog
where the warm, moist air rising from the valley
met the cold of the outside world.
It took her a moment to realize that the ticklish feeling on her temples was tears.
She was in a forest—an actual *forest*—and it was amazing,
but she missed the sea.
The hell with what the machines wanted
or the governors and their politics.
She just wanted to see Aunt Naggie and Honesty again
and flip through her picture book and go to sleep on her own mattress.

Her eyelids were just starting to lose their battle with gravity
when an alarm began to bleat.
Iñacio was on his feet and in his jacket
before she finished sitting up.
"Somethin's comin'," he said,
frowning at the app in his hand.
"Del that—there's a whole bunch o' somethin's coming."

"More o' those crab bots?"
Iffy asked,
struggling to lace her boots
with fingers that felt like they were made of tofu.

The Ecologist didn't answer.
"Iñacio?"
she asked,
then jumped as he swore explosively.

"It's the Marines.
Couple o' dozen,
headin' straight for us."
He swore again.
"Th' herd's gonna try t' slow 'em down,
but we gotta go."

"Go where?"
Iffy asked,
pulling on her coat.

Iñacio locked eyes with her.
"Anywhere but here.
They ain't never come into th' valley before,
but—Iffy,
this is sacred ground.
You unnerstand?
I gotta choose between this place an' you—"

Iffy held his gaze.
"You do what you gotta do,"
she said,
hoping she sounded braver than she felt.
"We can sort out th' compost 'n' all that some other time."

Two minutes later she was on a bicycle
pedalling hard and breathing harder.
Aunt Naggie had insisted she learn how to ride, "Just in case."
She was pretty sure her foster mother's "in case"
hadn't included this situation,
but there was no time to think about that,
no time to think about whether Iñacio had a plan
because even downhill on the world's best highway
there was no way they could move as fast as the Marines.

Up, down, up again—the forest disappeared behind them
as the track climbed the valley's eastern wall.
There was no sign of pursuit,
just her breathing and the burning in her legs
and a heart-stopping moment of panic
each time the bike hit a pothole or a particularly large rock
and nearly but never actually sent her tumbling
onto gravel that looked a lot sharper from the seak of the bike
than it had when she was walking on it.

Iñacio skidded to a stop as they reached the top of a ridge
and swung around to look back into the valley.
Iffy stopped beside him,
lungs heaving.
"Wha— wha's happenin'?"
she gasped as he pulled his app out of his coat.

He stared at it, stricken.
"They're killin' 'em.
Affin' griefers, they're killin' the herd!"

Iffy craned her neck.
Images tumbled past each other on the app.
A musk ox on its side,
eyes open and lifeless.
Another charging a Marine,
only to have its target step aside at the last moment
and snap a kick that broke the ox's leg.

The app flashed.
The images froze as whatever had been transmitting went offline,
perhaps forever.
"Mother Yanina, Mother Pao, forgive our crimes and arrogance,"
Iñacio whispered.

And then Iffy heard it,
the thrumming roar of a hovercraft moving fast over rough ground.
There!
East of them,
blurred but visible as its camouflage struggled to match the ground beneath it.
"Who th' hell is that?"
Iñacio demanded.

Iffy stared at him.
"How th' hell would I know?
But they brought a friend."
She pointed at a dot in the sky
flying parallel to the hovercraft's course.

Iñacio thrust the app into her hands and unslung his rifle.
"Get back on your bike," he ordered.
"There's a shelter about thirty klicks further on—the app's got a map an' a pass code.
You hole up there an' someone will come find you."

"Are you cracked?" Iffy shot back.
"I can't outrun a bunch o' Marines!
And I *surely* can't outrun that thing."

He adjusted the sight on his rifle.
"You won't have to,"
he said without looking at her.
"Like I told you,
this is sacred ground.
The governors 'n' all haven't stayed away all this time 'cuz we asked nicely."

The app vibrated in Iffy's hand.
"What's it say?"
the Ecologist asked.

Navy blue dots moved across a map in pairs and threes,
each cluster surrounded by a scattering of green dots.
"The Marines are in the valley.
They're almost at the greenhouses."

A red dot appeared on the map,
blinked,
expanded into a circle that swallowed three of the blue dots.
A second later Iffy heard a sharp *crack!* and a roll of thunder.
As the circle faded away,
two of the blue dots blinked and went out.

More red dots bloomed on the map
as one geothermal drill hole after another hit critical pressure and exploded.
"Saints and their mercies," Iffy whispered.

The distant thunder became a steady rumble.
The green dots swarmed the remaining blue dots.
Gunfire rattled and whined in the distance,
but the ballistic shots and EMP pulses that snuffed out the green dots in waves
weren't enough to turn the tide.

Nineteen and five… Sixteen and eight… Fourteen and ten…
The numbers in the corner of the map showed how many blue dots remained
and how many had gone dark.
At twelve and twelve the remaining Marines began to fall back.
The green dots kept pace but let them go.

"How bad is it?" Iñacio asked,
his eyes still on the approaching hovercraft.

Iffy swallowed.
The whole battle had taken less than thirty seconds.
"Half o' them are down.
The others are pullin' out."

"Never mind them," he snapped.
"How bad's the damage?"

She tapped the app to bring up a dozen tiled camera views.
Steam jetted out of the ground in some.
Others showed shattered rock and fallen trees.
And one—
"One o' the greenhouses got hit," she said.
"Looks like a tree came down on it."

Iñacio let out a long breath.
"Praise the saints.
That coulda been a lot worse."

Iffy stared at the video tile that showed a lifeless Marine not much older than her,
his exoskeleton twitching as it tried and failed to get him on his feet.
A crab bot climbed onto his chest and—
She bent over and threw up.
*Please let none o' them be Honesty,* she thought desperately.

"Y'aright?" Iñacio asked as she straightened up.

"No!
No, I'm not affin' aright!"
She spat the last of the sour vomit out of her mouth.
"There's folk *dead* back there!"

He didn't answer.
"Don't that bother you?" she demanded,
anger making her voice shake.

"'Course it does,"
he said brusquely.
"I grieve for every death that comes before its time.
I grieve for them as were made into soldiers against their wishes,
an' for the trees that were a hundred years in growin'
an' coulda lived a thousand more,
an' for every single thing we've torn up or burned down or poisoned or starved,
but right now there ain't time to think about any o' that
because those Marines ain't quit,
they're just comin' round th' long way,
an' we still got this other lot t' worry about."

*«assistance / possibility / negotiate»*

"Wait!"
Iffy grabbed Iñacio's shoulder as he took aim at the approaching drone.
"I think they're maybe on our side."

"Your voices tellin' you that?"
the Ecologist asked skeptically.

"I think so.
It's complicated,"
she added apologetically.

He hesitated before lowering his rifle
and slinging it over his shoulder.
"I hope you're right,"
he said,
taking the app from her and tapping in commands.
"Because we are well an' truly mulched if you're not."
He held it up to show a dozen blue dots converting on the blinking white star
that marked their position.

Moments later they were on their bikes
skidding down the ridge toward the oncoming hovercraft.
The cold air stung Iffy's cheeks,
and if the bumps and potholes on the climb up the ridge had been frightening,
going over them downhill at three times the speed was terrifying.
There wasn't time to be scared, though,
or to think about how quickly the Marines were closing in on them.
There was just staying upright as she followed Iñacio around the next turn
and trying not to go head-first over her handlebars
each time her front tire hit a rock.

Flat ground,
or at least flatter.
She struggled to change gears as Iñacio pulled ahead,
her hands clumsied by her gloves.
The hovercraft was a roaring blur in the distance,
still too far away to help.
She glanced up.
Where was the drone?

And then the bike went one way and she want another
and she was falling
just for a heartbeat
everything happened so fast
her knee hit the ground
pain shot up her spine
she put out her arm
but she was still falling
her hand hit the ground
pain again like a grenade going off in her shoulder.

The bike clattered on the ground,
trapping her leg.
She lay there for a moment in shock,
then cried out as she struggled to get up.
Her knee—her shoulder—it was like someone was using one of Mister Mishra's drills on her.

She kicked free of the bike with her uninjured leg
and cried out as she tried and failed to stand.
Iñacio braked,
fishtailed,
and raced back to her.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry," she repeated
as he leapt off his bike and helped her up.

"Sh, sh, sh."
He helped her sit in the shelter of a lichened outcrop of granite.
"Ya did great.
Ya did great.
Nagatha would be proud o' you.
Now,
keep yer head down.
This is gonna get a bit noisy."
He raised his rifle and took aim.

Iffy felt an explosion through the outcrop.
"Affin' hell," Iñacio swore,
ducking his head.
"That was their drone."

A rock two meters away jumped and splintered.
Iñacio pulled his app out of his coat and swore again.
"They've jammed up all th' sensors,
but there's a satellite comin' up overhead.
We just gotta hang on 'til then."

"Citizens!"
The amplified voice echoed off the rock.
"Surrender yourselves immediately!
We cannot ensure your safety if you do not comply!"

Iñacio caught Iffy's eye and grinned.
"I always thought they sounded pretty stupid when they talked like that."
And then he twisted a button on his cuff
to make the camouflage on his jacket jerk and swirl through not-quite random patterns
designed to confuse the Marines' targeting algorithms,
twisted around and up onto one knee,
and began firing.
He got off two shots before an impact in his chest sent him tumbling backward down the slope.

"Iñacio!" Iffy screamed.
The Ecologist slid downhill another meter and came to a rest,
his legs splayed awkwardly and the rifle still in his hands.

"Citizen!
Remain where you are!
Medical assistance will be provided shortly!"
Boots crunched on gravel uphill,
the steps stretched apart unnaturally by the exoskeletons' long strides.

Iffy got her legs underneath her,
biting back a whimper as pain lanced through her knee again.
She had to help Iñacio.
She had to run,
but there was nowhere to go
and she'd be lucky if she could walk.

*Crack! Crack! Crack!*
Iñacio's rifle jumped a little with each shot.
Iffy heard an indistinct shout of surprise—inducted or not,
the Marines were human enough to swear.
Iñacio rolled sideways back into the lee of the outcrop
as shots peppered the ground where he'd been lying.

"Stay there!" he snapped as Iffy started to rise.
He tossed his rifle aside,
its ammunition spent,
and scuttled uphill and sat beside her,
his back against the outcrop.

"Citizens!"
The Marine sounded more disappointed than angry.
"Such action will only worsen the charges against you.
For your own safety,
we urge you to surrender."

Iñacio looked at Iffy.
"Any ideas?"

She forced a smile that she hoped looked as confident as his grin.
"Reset this sim an' start over?"
As he started to laugh,
a thought appeared in her head.

*«assistance»*

One moment the sky was blue.
The next,
it was slashed by a pair of brilliant laser-straight lines
as the hypersonic harpoons fired by the hovercraft tore the air apart.
The missiles burst over Iffy's head before she had time to flinch.
Dozens of EMP grenades,
each the size of a pebble,
ended their existence in brief bursts of plasma.
Feedback shrieked as the micromotors in a dozen exoskeletons overloaded and fused solid.

Iñacio pulled Iffy to her feet.
"Come on!"

One hand clutching his collar,
the other swinging wildly for balance,
she limp-walked down the gravel slope toward the oncoming hovercraft.
It had turned off its camouflage,
and as it gunned its engines to brake itself
she realized that it was taller than she was
and as long and broad as the *Guinevere*.

"Citizens! Stop!"
The voice behind them was no longer amplified.
"You don't know what you are doing!"

Cold air washed over Iffy as the hovercraft settled onto the ground.
Two sentry bots dropped from its steeply-angled side
and raced past her and Iñacio
to stand guard between them and the fallen Marines.

A hatch opened on the hovercraft's leading edge just as they reached it.
Something bulbous poked out.
Iffy thought it was another bot,
but then he removed his helmet.

"Well,"
said the governor conversationally.
"Isn't this a fine mess?"

"Halley?"
Iñacio demanded incredulously.

Even from ten meters away Iffy felt the temperature drop.
"Paddington South, actually," he corrected
in the same clipped accent that the Marines used.
"Although I suspect that's rather a matter for debate right now,
to tell you the truth.
All I'm sure I've governor of is this craft and a few odds and ends like it."
He patted the hovercraft's hull as if it was an old dog asleep at his feet.

"And you must be Citizen Kwan,"
he continued,
shifting his gaze.
"You've caused quite a ruckus, young citizen.
My others' schemes are completely upside down—thank you for that—and
the machines are in some sort of tizzy
and you seem to be the center of all of it.
I'm sure it will give us plenty to talk about on our way."

Iñacio put a cautioning hand on Iffy's shoulder.
"Appreciate you helpin' out with th' Marines an' all,
but we're fine t' make our own way along by th' coast."

"Mm."
The governor nodded as if agreeing.
"How far do you think you'll get, exactly?
And how much of your precious herd will die along the way?
How many trees will burn, Ecologist,
and how much difference do you think any of it will make?"

"You sure talk pretty,"
Iffy said in the silence that followed.

The governor chuckled.
"Well, I *have* had a lot of practice.
But I'm afraid we can't dawdle any further.
Citizen Corrales,
you and Citizen Kwan can come aboard of your own accord or not as you choose,
but you *are* coming with me."

One—two—three more sentry bots blurred out of invisibility
in front of Iffy and Iñacio.
Mechanical feet scuffed on gravel behind her
as the two she had seen moved closer.

Iñacio puffed out his cheeks and exhaled slowly.
"You know I can't do that," he said.

The governor put his hand on his chest.
"You have my solemn pledge that you will not be interfered with.
I have no desire at all to pick a fight with the Shepherds.
Whatever secrets or access codes you have will remain yours and yours alone."

"Yeah."
Iñacio sighed.
"I wish I believed you,
but your record ain't exactly positive,
an' you just havin' been kicked outta your home,
well,
that's gotta make you a little desperate."

He turned to Iffy and wrapped his arms around her in a fierce hug.
"I'm sorry,"
he whispered in her ear.
"I'm so sorry.
I know I said I'd carry you,
but I can't let 'im have what's in my head.
Tell Nagatha I was thinkin' of her, aright?"

He stepped back and made a fist.
Without warning,
a schematic flashed into Iffy's mind.
Wires and a tiny battery embedded in his hand
that would look prosthetic to a casual scan.
A matching mesh of micro-fine filaments under his skull.
Clench the hand like *this*,
hold it *there*,
and—

As Iñacio raised his hand the governor shouted, "Wait!"
Iffy tackled the Ecologist,
grabbing his arm and knocking him clumsily to the ground.
The EMP that was supposed to scramble his brain
sent feedback shrieking through the sentry bots' motors instead.

Iñacio scrambled back onto his feet.
"No! No, Iffy, whattaya done?"

"Affin' hell!" she swore,
trying, failing, and trying again to stand
despite the spike of pain in her knee.
"You made me a promise an' I'm holdin' you to it.
If you want someone to tell Aunt Naggie that you went an' got simple,
you can do it yourself!"

She glared at him.
The sentry bots and the downed Marines and the hovercraft and the governor
and the miracle in the valley behind them
might as well have been a world away.
"I lost my others.
I lost Honesty.
I ain't losin' you."

## Chapter 10

There were Marines on board Governor Stern's hovercraft,
all apparently imprinted with the same taciturn personality.
Two of them flanked Iñacio
as he disappeared stone-faced into the belly of the hovercraft
while the governor breezily explained to Iffy
that he was a man of his word
and that the Ecologist would be fine.
"Anyway,
it's not as if what he tried to do would actually have worked,"
he said.
Brainwipes worked very differently in real life
than they did in sims.
Deep memories would survive the EMP pulse,
just as a person's original personality survived imprinting.
As for more recent knowledge,
well,
the Shepherds had undoubtedly changed their access codes already,
and their network of shelters and greenhouses weren't actually as secret as they thought.

Iffy expected to be locked in a cell next to Iñacio.
Instead,
a Marine ushered her up steeply-laddered steps to the hovercraft's cockpit.
"Have a seat," the governor said,
gesturing at the padded chair to the left of the one he had been sitting in.
"Oh, and please, do buckle up.
This old thing was built for speed, not comfort."

Iffy limped over to the chair
and lowered herself onto it with a wince.
The governor clucked his tongue.
"I'll have someone take a look at that for you later."
Seating himself and snapping harness straps together across his chest,
he laid his hands on the apps set into the arms of his chair.

The display in front of them came to life.
A dozen views of the surrounding tundra
nestled between status displays like those Iffy had grown up with on the *Guinevere*.
Temperatures and battery reserves,
the rotational speeds of idling engines,
weather reports,
and projections from a hundred independent simulations of the next few moments
waited for attention
like courtiers waiting on a king.

"Where're we goin'?" Iffy asked sullenly.
She had loosened the straps of her harness so that she could wriggle out if she needed to,
but the straps had re-tightened themselves
as soon as she snapped the buckle closed.

"That's an excellent question,"
Governor Stern replied absently
as he rearranged the display with a few flicks of his fingers.
"Where *are* we going?
My others have never had much of an answer.
Truth be told,
I suspect they've never really believed one was needed.
Now, don't mind the noise.
I'm sure you'll get used to it."

The engines beneath them rumbled.
The hovercraft rose like a ship being lifted by a wave,
rotating smoothly on its self-made cushion of air.
Orange status lights blinked and turned green
as the sentry bots climbed back aboard.
"All accounted for, sir,"
said the Marine seated beside Iffy.

"Right, then, tally ho."
The governor flicked his fingers again
and the hovercraft shot forward like a startled seagull.

Acceleration pushed Iffy back in her seat.
Fifty klicks an hour, a hundred… two hundred…
At two hundred and fifty the numbers on the display stopped climbing
and the pressure lifted from her chest.
She took a deep breath and watched the world race by
as the hovercraft bumped and shook toward the horizon.
The only people in the world going faster than her at that preciese moment
were either on trains
or desperate enough to take to the air
and hope the machines' satellites didn't spot them.

The novelty wore off quickly.

Someone did show up
to give Iffy a patch to dull the pain in her knee and shoulder
and speed their healing.
Her eyelids grew heavy
as the drugs and timed retroviral accelerators seeped through her skin.
Even a mug of something thick and sweet that the governor called "chocolate"
wasn't enough to keep them from closing.

At least,
that's what she hoped whoever was watching her would believe.
She had learned how to keep sleep at bay on night watches long ago.
Right now,
she had some thinking to do
and she didn't want to be disturbed.

*Wireframes swam in the darkness.
The hovercraft had been built as a blockade runner in Tashkent
before the start of the machine wars.
Its heart was a reactor originally designed for use in a submarine—she
took a moment to admire the sleek, single-minded recklessness of its design—and
the motors that created its cushion of air
would have pumped fuel at hypersonic speeds
in orbital booster rockets
if history had unfolded just a little bit differently.
The hull plating was angled to deflect the energy of ballistic attacks
and threaded with microfilaments not unlike those in Iñacio's skull
to handle electronic ones.
Ventilation tubes,
triple-redundant optical wiring,
and plumbing liberated from a luxury hotel
slithered between bulkheads.*

*She flipped the wireframe upside down and rightside up,
flew through it,
spun it around.
Any of a dozen rooms or holds could have been repurposed as a cell.
For one moment she thought about reaching out to the hovercraft's core,
but no,
it would be better protected than the railgun back on the pier had been
and anyway,
she still didn't know how she had done that.
She needed a plan if she was going to rescue Iñacio.*

She yawned widely.
The images slipped away as her concentration finally conceded
to the painkillers and reconstructives.
A moment later she began to snore softly.

She woke to the smell of curried noodles,
and for a disoriented few seconds she thought she was back on the *Guinevere*
and late for her watch.
But no,
she was still buckled into her chair in the cockpit of the hovercraft.
She took the plate that the expressionless man in a Marine-blue jumpsuit offered her
and fumbled with the chopsticks
while she waited for her mind to catch up with the rest of her.

The governor was gone,
but the gently undulating tundra on the screens around her looked the same as it had.
Their speed hadn't changed either,
she noticed,
or their heading.
She did a quick calculation in her head.
If they had stayed on their original course,
they must be nearing the coast.
If they followed it east through the Shackletons
it would take them another ten hours to reach Halley,
if in fact that was where they were going.
If they turned right it would take them half again as long to get to
the crater that marked where McMurdo had once been,
and if they headed straight for Paddington South—

She shook her head and scooped some noodles into her mouth,
blowing around them as she realized they were hot *and* spicy.
Going to Halley didn't make any sense,
but since it gave her the least time it was probably what was going to happen.

She chewed thoughtfully,
then looked up at the Marine.
"It's really good,
but can I please have some more onions on it?
An' some more o' that chocolate stuff from earlier?
If that's aright,"
she added hastily.

The Marine looked at her,
his expression still as empty as the tundra.
"Good morning,
Citizen Kwan,"
the governor said pleasantly from a speaker somewhere in the cockpit.
"I'm glad to see you have an appetite."

"It's really good," she said truthfully.
"I'm just used t' more onions."

"Mm.
And of course you'd like to see more of the *Henry Lion*,
I assume."

She shrugged.
"Not much else t' do,
'less you're aright with me talkin' to Iñacio for a bit."

"I'm afraid that's out of the question for now,"
the governor said briskly.
"All right.
Private Norbu will take you down to the galley
and then show you to your cabin.
May I please ask you to forebear any dramatics?"

"What?"
she asked,
fumbling to undo the buckles on her harness.

The governor's voice sighed faintly.
"Don't do anything foolish?"

"Ah.
Sure,
aright."
She wriggled out of the straps without spilling any of her noodles,
then stood up and tested her knee.
Whatever had been in the patch seemed to have set it right.
If she had to run,
she could.
The trick now was having somewhere to run *to*.

As she stepped past Private Norbu
she slipped the metal button cover she had pried off her chair
into her pocket.

The galley was twice the size of the *Guinevere*'s
but much noisier.
The schematic in her head showed her the pipes,
drive shafts,
and optical cables
crammed into the half meter between its floor
and the foamed steel armor on the hovercraft's belly.
She could see three different ways to make trouble if she could reach them,
but she had no way to do that.
Even if she did,
they all had backups that had backups of their own.
The hovercraft was tough by design:
someone could punch a dozen shots from a heavy-duty railgun right through it
without slowing it down.

Private Norbu stood near the galley door and watched her eat.
She ignored him the same way she had learned to ignore shopkeepers
who didn't think an orphan dredger had any place in their store.
She thought briefly about trying to steal her chopsticks,
but by the time she finished her chocolate she had decided it was too risky.
They felt like aluminum,
and she could do a lot with a couple of aluminum rods,
but Private Norbu was right there
and there were probably cameras she couldn't see as well.
No,
the chopsticks were almost certainly a dead end.
The loose screw on the underside of the table,
on the other hand…

Her cabin had a fold-up bunk
and a single shallow drawer set into the bulkhead.
She picked up the app that lay on the neatly-dressed bunk
as Private Norbu closed and locked the door behind her.
It was the same model she had used as a child,
but completely locked down:
she couldn't even get the weather on it,
much less use it connect to Hell.

She kicked off her boots and lay down.
"Lights," she said after a moment.
The room dutifully went dark.

She closed her eyes.
There was no way she had the plans for every piece of hardware on the planet
stuck in her head.
Even if she did,
that wouldn't explain how she was able to talk to the machines
or how they were able to plant ideas in her mind.
She took slow, steady breaths to slow her pulse,
then tried to visualize herself.

Nothing happened at first,
or rather,
hundreds of things that weren't her formed, flew apart, and re-formed behind her eyes.
She saw something that looked like a mechanical musk ox
designed to hide in the herd,
and marvelled for a moment at
the ingenious way it emulated its organic namesake's digestive processes.
This was the *Guinevere* as she had been the day she first sailed.
That was French Henry in pieces on a workbench in Halley,
and for a moment she saw how the bot had once fitted into
an attack craft not unlike the hovercraft she was in.

And that—right there—was her.
She forgot to breathe for a moment as the image rotated slowly,
panning and zooming as her attention shifted.
In her spine,
along her nerves,
laced through her brain:
they weren't wires—those would be too easy for a scanner to spot—but rather
tiny fractalized patches of cells arranged in precisely the right way
to make her a living antenna.

And any antenna that could receive a signal could send one.

It only took her a minute to find an opening in the hovercraft's systems.
It took her another to find one that wasn't a trap,
and another hour to convince herself that she was right.
Fifteen years ago,
just a few days after she had been born,
a tech in Paddington South had replaced a reactor coolant pump
with one salvaged from an Aussie submarine
that had suffered a catastrophic loss of containment.
(Her hand twitched as if swiping an app
to toss aside the insurance reports and obituaries
that thought called up.)
The tech had cut corners to meet a deadline
(another twitch dispelled performance reviews and der eventual dismissal).
One of those corners had been a software shim
to connect the monitor's century-old software
to the hovercraft's merely elderly systems.

She studied the code tangled around the hardware
like nerves and veins around bones.
The pump's core was dumber than a seagull:
if she nudged it there and there and *there*,
it would believe that the hovercraft's reactor was going critical
and bypass its own safeties
to try to prevent disaster.
When the other pumps asked it what the hell it thought it was doing,
the long-ago tech's shoddy work would let her persuade them
that they had been ordered to shut down for maintenance.

She smiled,
not caring who might be watching through a hidden camera,
then rolled on her side and brought her hand to her mouth
as if to stifle a yawn.

The metal button cover she had stolen was stronger than she had expected.
For a moment she thought she might crack a tooth,
but then it bent enough for her to bite down and flatten it.
She spat the half-circle of metal with its two precious points
back into her hand,
rolled over again to cover the motion of slipping it back into her pocket,
and *pushed* with her mind.

Eleven point two meters away,
a pump whirred into overdrive.
Exactly three seconds later
its partners queried it,
compared the answers they received,
and powered down.
Iffy squelched the notifications they sent to the hovercraft's core
moments before they would have set off an alarm.
*Sleep well,* she thought giddily.
She had never ridden a high-speed multi-ton atomic bomb before.
She wondered how many people had,
and how many of them had lived to tell the tale.

She didn't realize her nose was bleeding
until an alarm klaxon began to blare
and she tried to stand up.
She had expected the alarm—in fact,
she was counting on it—but
she hadn't counted on being so lightheaded that
the room went distant and swam around her.
She bent over,
her elbows on the bunk and her face pressed against her forearms.

"Shad," she swore weakly.
There was a lot of blood,
even more than the time Akumé had punched her in the face
for calling der a thief
(which de had been,
but the other kids on the pier had been too smart or too afraid of der to say it).
Wiping her face with a handful of bedsheet didn't stop the steady red drip.

Iffy laughed weakly.
She had been so worried that someone would notice her stealing the button cover,
and now it turned out she needn't have bothered.
She wouldn't have to scratch herself to get a few red cells
to fool the hovercraft's genetic sensors:
she had as many as she could possibly want.

She straightened up and worked her tongue in her mouth.
It still felt like someone had replaced it with a piece of pressed jellyfish,
but the room no longer felt like an endlessly-receding tunnel from a horror sim.
She focused on the app lying on the bunk and pushed with her mind once again.
Something inside the door clicked and it slid aside.

Two minutes later she stood in front of another cabin door
and pressed her sticky hand against the contact place beside it.

"Affin' heck, girl, what happened t' you?" Iñacio asked as he stood.

"You should see the other guy," she said
grinning woozily.
"Any idea where our gear is?"

He shook his head.
"Prolly in a recycler by now anyway.
So whatta we do now?"

She jerked her chin toward the stern.
"Back an' out an' then figure th' rest out from there."

Someone was banging against one of the doors they passed.
They were shouting, too.
Iffy thought it was funny but didn't have enough energy to laugh.
At some point Iñacio had put his arm around her to help her stay upright.
He had picked up a fire extinguisher as well,
a compact red cylinder with a silver handle
whose basic design hadn't changed in centuries.
She blinked away the specs that flashed into her mind.
*Not now,* she thought.
Her nose was still dripping.
Anyone who wanted to find them could just follow the trail of drops and streaks on the floor.

"Here," she mumbled.
"…straps…"

"'Saright, 'saright, I got it,"
Iñacio said soothingly.
He turned her around and lowered her onto the molded plastic seat,
then buckled the harness across her chest
and pulled a bulky pair of goggles down over her eyes and nose.
"Bite on this,"
he told her,
pushing a mouthpiece against her lips.

Cold air filled her lungs as she breathed in.
"Ready?
No,
don' worry,
I'll be right behind you."
He took her wrists and placed her hands on the grips built into the seat.
"One… two… *three*."

She screamed into the mouthpiece as hovercraft fired the ejection seat into the air
like an old-fashioned artillery shell.
Daylight blinded her.
Ice-cold wind instantly numbed her cheeks.
Tiny gyros whined to stabilize the chair
long enough for the explosive bolts in its back to fire.
A translucent parawing snapped open.
The surge of deceleration threw her against her harness
and then she was swinging like a pendulum
as the parawing's tiny core picked a safe landing spot
and turned toward it.

The ground below her was covered with snow.
The harsh white reached from horizon to horizon,
interrupted only by a few dark boulders
and the camouflaged rectangular bulk of the hovercraft
that was already several hundred meters away.
It must have turned inland toward the pole,
but Iffy didn't have time to think about that.
She was flying,
really actually flying,
except it was going to be over in a few seconds
and if the chair hit the ground the wrong way
she might tumble and snap her neck.
The gyros were supposed to prevent that,
but she had seen their specs when she was planning her escape
and they had last been serviced by the same tech
who had screwed up the coolant pump.

A flash of light at the rear of the hovercraft
threw a black dot into the seamless blue sky.
A hundred meters above the ground it jerked suddenly
as its parawing deployed.
Iffy's fumbling fingers finally found the catch on the harness buckle.
It bleeped and flashed,
unhappy about being unfastened while in the air,
but she jammed her thumb down hard to force it open.

Snow raced away beneath her far too fast for safety.
She was headed straight for a boulder.
She was going to hit it.
She was going to hit it,
but the parawing cupped the air to brake,
throwing her hard against the straps as if to punish her for breaking its rules.

The chair landed on the snow with a crunch.
Iffy spat out the mouthpiece,
pulled off her goggles,
wriggled out of the straps,
tripped,
and fell face-first into the little snowbank thrown up by the chair's impact.
Ice crystals stung her face and hands.
It was cold,
she realized,
really cold.
They must have come a long way inland.

The chair bleeped.
Panels popped off its bulky arms
to reveal a featherweight windproof parka rolled up
to be not much larger than a lunch-sized roti on one side
and a waistpack with a tiny first aid kid,
a ruggedized app,
a pair of multitools,
and three high-energy snack bars on the other.
The specs had shown four,
and as she strapped the waistpack on
she wondered if that long-ago tech had gotten hungry while he was working.

It took her three tries to clamber up the boulder.
Her nosebleed had stopped,
leaving bits of red crust on her lip,
but she was still lightheaded.
She shielded her eyes with her hand.
There—Iñacio's chair had just landed a few hundred meters away.
The governor had undoubtedly retaken control of the hovercraft,
only to discover that all three coolant pumps had burned out
and would need to be replaced
before it could move again.
If his Marines had the same exoskeletons as the ones in Halley and Rothera,
she and Iñacio only had a few minutes before they arrived
to recapture their ex-prisoners.

"Hey!"
She waved both arms.
Iñacio waved back and started toward her.
Iffy slipped off the boulder,
made her way back to the chair,
and got to work.

The upper back plate on the ejection seat had six screws.
The lower plate only had four.
The schematic in her head didn't need them,
but she pocketed them anyway as she took them out.
"No such thing as scrap," she muttered under her breath.
It was one of Mister Mishra's favorite sayings,
but there wasn't time to think about him or Jeep
because she had to tighten the spigot valve on the seat's tiny fuel line all the way
before prying out the fist-sized tank of high-test peroxide
or she and her escape were both going to be very short-lived.

Iñacio's boots crunched on the snow a minute later.
"What're you—oh no.
No no no,
you can't be serious."

She grinned madly and pointed at the parawing
without looking up from the vernier motor she was crimping into place.
"Straighten that out if you can
an' then get the straps off th' chair.
We're gonna have t' double up."

Another minute, another minute—there.
Iñacio handed her the ends of the parawing's tether lines.
She clipped them onto the harness and handed it back to him.
"I can't carry you, so you gotta carry me," she said,
cutting off his protests.

The snow field dipped gently on the far side of the boulder.
It wasn't much,
but it would have to do.
"Ready?" she asked.

Iñacio shook his head.
"Nope."
He bent over like a sprinter and started to run.

Iffy waited for the lines to go nearly taut before shouting,
"Now!"
and yanking the edge of the parawing up as hard as she could.
The makeshift rocket strapped to Iñacio's back flared,
kicking him forward.
For an instant Iffy thought it wasn't going to work,
but the core she had pulled out of the chair wasn't smart enough to wonder
how or why its world had changed.
It just knew its wing was out of position.
Tiny motors whirred,
frantically adjusting the parawing's shape
so that it cut the air at just the right angle
to lift Iñacio into the air.

He whooped,
his feet still pedalling as they left the ground.
Iffy ran back and scrambled up the boulder and shielded her eyes,
her heart pounding.
Four black dots had come over the horizon.
She counted seconds under her breath.
The snow was slowing them down, but not much.

"Over here!" she shouted,
waving as Iñacio banked in a wide, clumsy turn.
One moment he was over *there*
and the next he was coming straight at her,
wide-eyed and shouting something she couldn't hear.
She took a deep breath and spread her arms wide.

Iñacio hit her with a thump that cracked her spine.
His hands scrabbled for purchase on her parka,
but the fabric was too slippery,
it was designed to shed water and he couldn't get a grip
but that was aright,
she had grabbed hold of the straps
and her feet were kicking at nothing but air.

She twisted around as far as she dared as he whooped again.
The rocket on his back flared again,
lifting them higher.
*It's me, it's just me,* she thought frantically,
hoping that whatever faraway machine she had made her bargain with was listening.

"So what now?"
Iñacio had to shout to be heard over the wind in their ears.

"I gave it a heading,"
Iffy shouted back.
"Figure we got about half an hour in the air.
We'll have to walk the rest o' the way."
The snow field below her looked exactly like a sim but was completely different.
She finally understood why so many people wrote poetry about flying,
and why they said that of all the machines had taken away from humanity,
this was the one whose loss hurt the most.

In the end the little rocket only lasted ten minutes,
but that was enough to get them high enough to catch the wind.
Antarctica rolled away behind them.
Iffy's shoulders began to ache,
then to burn.
The straps they were tangled in dug in to her triceps.
She'd have bruises,
but she'd had worse,
and the view—whatever else happened,
she swore she would find a way to fly again.

After one last lift from a thermal rising off a stretch of exposed rock
they began a long, slow descent.
"Get ready!" Iñacio shouted.
Iffy grabbed the strap with one numb hand and let go with the other
so that she was half beside and half behind him.
The parawing's little motors whined in protest as they reshaped it
to adjust for the shift in weight.
Ten seconds…
Five…
As her boots grazed the snow she tried to run,
but her toe caught on a crust of ice.
She let go of Iñacio and sprawled face-forward.

His landing was more graceful.

"Well," he said,
helping her to her feet
as the parawing carried the harness away.
"Can't wait to tell Nagatha about *that*."

She wiped ice and snow off her face and returned his grin.
"Sure was somethin'.
C'mon,
we still got some walkin' t' do."

Two snack bars and several mouthfuls of lukewarm water later,
they reached an outcropping of rock too regular to be natural.
Iñacio ran his hands over the pipe shafts drilled into its laser-cut top.
"Old weather station?" he hazarded.
"Looks like it was salvaged a long time gone."

"Mm hm."
Iffy pointed at the shadow on the horizon.
"You know what that is?"

Iñacio laughed.
"Girl,
I have no idea where I am right now.
You could tell me that was the Andes an' I'd believe you."

"That's Mount Tyree."
Iffy's voice was more serious than she'd intended.
"The secret base Wales an' th' machines an' everyone have been goin' on about?
It's halfway 'round to your right an' just shy o' the peak.
I figure that's where th' governor was takin' us."

Iñacio nodded slowly.
"Long way off."

"Yeah, well."
Iffy studied the dark rock in front of them.
"Dunno what kind o' sims you play,
but my favorites?
Nobody puts an underground base in 'em without puttin' a bunch of other stuff around it,
so I had a poke around the governor's backups while you were lazin' around on th' hovercraft."

There.
She pulled off her glove,
scraped some dried blood out of her nostril,
and stuck her finger in one of the drill holes.
The rock thought for a second and then opened with a faint click.

She grinned at Iñacio.
"Welcome to *my* secret lair."

*Suppose the world is ending
and you want to build a secret research facility—a place
completely cut off from what's left of the world's governments
or (more importantly) their artificial minions
so that you can create or study things you shouldn't
without being interrupted.
You might think that the first step was to choose a location,
but it's not.
The actual first step is to pick a cover story
that gives you a plausible reason to imprint prisoners and indentured laborers
with the skills you need
and then erase their memories afterward.
(In theory you will only erase their memories of where they were and what they did.
In practice the process is sometimes imprecise,
particularly if you want to err on the side of caution,
but if you're the sort of person who needs a secret research facility,
you're probably also the sort who believes that
nothing worth having comes without some kind of price.)*

*If your cover story is something to do with reforesting ravaged rainforests
you will probably build your base in Africa or Indonesia.
You might consider Brazil,
but even before the war with the machines
it has become a complicated place as nationalism,
macumba,
and apocalyptic ecology hybridize in ever-more-strident ways.
If your cover story is related to climate engineering,
on the other hand,
no one will raise an eyebrow if your site is somewhere formerly arctic.
The Melt hit the poles first and hardest,
and most of those mad enough to believe that the damage can be undone
by scattering megatons of absorbent catalysts over thousands of square kilometers
naturally congregate there.*

*The poles are exactly the wrong place to go
if you want people to believe that you plan to launch something into orbit,
but in a way that works in your favor.
Everyone expects you to lie about what you're actually doing,
so telling part of the truth is a good way to hide the part left unsaid.
A ground station for a network of microsatellites
flung into orbit by an automated factory located somewhere on the far side of the Moon?
You are so obviously courting condemnation for adding to the already catastrophic volume of space junk
that no one will suspect that's what your base is actually for.
Or rather,
everyone (and everything) will suspect it,
but only as one of a thousand low-probability possibitilies.*

*To finish throwing them off the scent,
you can build a dozen safe havens in a circle around your base.
To keep the workers safe,
your public relations bot explains to anyone who cares to pay attention.
Antarctica's storms have been growing in frequency and severity for decades,
and it will only be a matter of time before tornadoes appear.
You may not be able to guarantee that your laborers will return with their memories intact,
but you will of course do your utmost to ensure that they do return.
Deeply dug and well provisioned,
your bunkers will allow them to wait out the worst the southern continent can throw at them in comfort.*

Iñacio insisted on climbing down the ladder ahead of Iffy,
so he was the first one to realize that something bad had happened in the shelter
many years ago.
"You might not wanna come down here,"
he called up to her.

*Ain't like a got a lot o' choices,*
she thought but didn't say.
The Marines could reach them in a couple of hours if they pushed their exoskeletons to their limits,
but the governor was sure to have other tools at his disposal.
If they couldn't find something in the shelter they could be trapped,
and a siege would only end one way.

The smell hit her halfway down.
It wasn't rank like the week-dead seagull she had once found in a storage bin behind the Sandhus' store,
trapped by a lid closing behind it as it scrounged for scraps.
Instead,
the smell was tired and a little bit sour.

"Core woulda shut off power after he died,"
Iñacio said as they studied the mummified body
lying a stride away from the bottom of the ladder.
"Cold an' dry air—coulda happened last year,
coulda been a hundred years ago."

"More likely a hundred,"
Iffy replied,
feeling oddly detached.
Whoever he had been,
he'd had long dark hair and a beard.
The inside of his parka was silvered like hers,
and if he had brought any gear,
it had either been taken by whoever shot him
or was lying on the shelves that lined the shelter's walls.

She shook herself.
"C'mon.
Let's see what we got."

What they had turned out to be weapons,
dried food that had either spoiled or mummified like the corpse,
several camouflage snowsuits with boots and breathing masks
(she puzzled over this for a bit),
and a small workshop stocked with tools and spare parts that made her hands itch.
"Looks like they were buildin' bots,"
she told Iñacio,
turning a laser cutter over in her hands.

"Or takin' 'em apart."
He pulled a tarp off something that looked like
an oversized version of the sentry bots she was familiar with.
One of its side panels was folded back to reveal its motors and cables.
Another tarp revealed a second bot with the same bulky body and limbs
but a cluster of cameras and antennas where its head should have been.
The mod had clearly been made in haste:
the welds joining the additions to the bot's neck looked messy and unfinished,
and a handful of string-thin optical cables dangled from the opening.

Iffy looked around the shelter's single large room a second time.
Something didn't make sense.
"How were th' bots gonna get out?" she asked suddenly.
"No way they could make it up th' ladder."

Iñacio nodded,
putting the short-barrelled thump gun he had picked up
back on its shelf.
"I'll check th' walls.
You wanna see if you can get anythin' outta that?"
He pointed at the desktop near the two bots.

She nodded and sat on the stool in front of it.
The faint scum of dust on the app felt gritty under
the finger she swiped across it.
"Aright,"
she muttered.
"What have you got for me?"

Five minutes later she smacked the app in frustration.
"I can't find a way in," she sulked,
slumping down in the chair.

"Here."
Iñacio tossed her a thumb-sized key on a thin chain.
"It was around his neck,"
he explained as she stooped over to pick it up.

The key fit into a slot on the edge of the app.
Its screen went a deep blue.
A single icon appeared,
waiting patiently to be tapped.

Iffy bit her lip.
"Could be some kind o' malware.
Like, a trap or somethin' to fry anyone that looks at it."

Iñacio nodded.
"Could be."
Without warning he spun her around
and pushed hard on the back of her chair.

"Hey!" she squawked as she rolled away.
"What are you—"

"—a chance to hear this,
but if you do,
I'm sorry, love.
I'm so, so sorry."
The recorded voice was a man,
and sounded tired and frightened and brave all at once.
"I thought we could fix things,
but we've only made them worse."

Iñacio turned and beckoned her to join him as the recording continued.
"Suyin left this morning with the last of the shielding."
The voice chuckled or choked back a sob—it was impossible to tell which.
"She said she thought she might be able to make it to the machine
if she cycled the algorithm rapidly enough,
but I think she just wanted to be with Georgia,
wherever the hell she is now.
None of the other shelters are answering any more,
not even Johnson's team."

Iffy reached for Iñacio's hand.
He squeezed hers back.
"I've disabled two of the guard robots—at least I think I have—but
number three is still roaming around in the auxiliary tunnels.
I know we all agreed that—that the project needed a failsafe,
but…"
The voice paused for a heartbreaking moment.
"But I never thought we'd need it.
I never thought we'd—oh crap."

Iffy jumped at the sharp *crack!*
Iñacio squeezed her hand again at the sound of something heavy hitting the floor.
A moment later metal clicked on concrete
as something approached the app,
and then the recording ended with a soft, cheerful *ding*.

"Well."
Iñacio gently pulled his hand free and swiped the app.
"Doctor Arno Severin,"
he read aloud as Iffy lowered herself back into her chair.
"Doesn't say who it was for,
but I'm guessin' these two were Suyin an' Georgia."
He paused.
"Oh.
Well,
ain't this a surprise."
He looked at her over his shoulder.
"I think you're gonna wanna see this."

Iffy nodded but didn't stand.
She knew the Marines were getting closer every moment,
but all of a sudden she just felt tired.

"Iffy?
Y'aright?"

"Yeah."
She pulled herself to her feet.

Two dozen smiling, confident faces were arranged on the app
in eight rows of three.
The top row contained a man with long dark hair and a beard
and two women who looked like clones of each other.

"Recognize him?" Iñacio asked,
pointing.

Iffy nodded slowly.
"Yeah.
Yeah, I do."
Somehow she wasn't surprised to see Johnson Wales looking back at her.

## Chapter 11

There were no other recordings,
at least not that Iffy could find,
but there were maps and schematics.
The maps showed a network of maintenance tunnels
just big enough for centipede-shaped bots
that reminded Iffy of French Henry.
She would be able to fit her arm into one of them,
but no more,
and some of them ran (or had run) for tens of kilometers.

There were other tunnels too, though,
big enough for heavy equipment.
Some were dense with red flags that showed collapse,
flooding,
or chronic instability.
She puzzled over that for a second before dismissing it.
Reasons weren't important:
a blocked tunnel was no use to them.

Iffy had expected the web of tunnels to be centered on the Niobium base.
Instead,
the center was a kilometer further south
on the slope of Mount Tyree instead of at its peak.
Iñacio shrugged when she pointed this out.
"Wouldn't be surprised if th' real whatever is somewhere else again."
He jerked his head toward Severin's remains,
which he had wrapped in the tarp he had pulled off the sentry bot.
"Folks like this never thought in straight lines.
Whatever you can see ain't real,
and whatever's real,
they'll have hidden under three different kinds o' camouflage."

But the mystery of what was actually buried under Mount Tyree
wasn't what made Iffy chew her lips
the way she had when she was first learning algebra.
That was the schematics' fault.
They made no sense.
She could think of a hundred uses for a superconducting ring
large enough to sail the *Guinevere* through,
but why put a bamboo rat cage at its center?
And if you had a yottahertz laser capable of vaporizing steel from orbit,
why would you point it directly at an identical laser,
and why would you leave just enough space between them for
one (1) adult with arctic-rated camping equipment
and a month's worth of high-energy rations?

She sat back,
stretched,
and yawned so widely that her jaw clicked.
The only explanation that made sense was that
the app's records had been deliberately scrambled and polluted
when things went skew.
It didn't matter now:
if the governor had sent Marines,
they would arrive in an hour,
maybe less.
She had done her best to wipe the shelter from the hovercraft's memory,
but they would have other records.
Even if they didn't,
they would have to be blind to miss the parawing and bootprints,
and they wouldn't have come all this way
without something that could cut through
the rock concealing the entrance.

"I don't like it,"
Iñacio said,
studying the route she had sketched on the map
that filled half the app.

Iffy shrugged.
"Every other way I can find has a big chunk o' walkin' in it.
This might too if there's been more cave-ins,
but there's no way o' knowin' 'til we get there.
'Sides,
more chance o' meetin' some actual monsters this way.
Be a waste t' be down here an' not run into any."

The Ecologist snorted.
"Folks ever tell you you're a bit sideways from normal?"

Iffy shrugged again.
"Most never get t' know me well enough to find out,"
she admitted.

Iñacio put his hand on her shoulder and gave her a gentle shake.
"I'm glad I have.
You get th' bots back online.
I'll see what I can do about wheels."
He studied the sketch she had thrown together
on the other half of the app,
shook his head,
and began rummaging through the shelves of equipment that lined the shelter's wall.

It took Iffy ten minutes to fix the damage done to the sentry bots
and another ten to convince herself they were safe to power on.
Their optical sensors didn't glow red—that only happened in sims—but
she did take an involuntary step back
when their heads turned in unison toward her.

"Sit," she ordered.
One lowered itself to the concrete.
The other studied her
while its core tried to decide whether her voice patterns
matched those in its memory closely enough.

"I said *sit*," she repeated as firmly as she could.
The bot took a step toward her,
hesitated,
and crouched beside its twin.

Iffy swallowed drily.
The problem wasn't that the bots' programming was too complex for her to figure out.
The problem was that it was too simple to fool easily.
She didn't know if that was because they were old enough
that their code didn't have anything from the machine wars mixed into it,
or whether they had been built that way deliberately for safety.
Mister Mishra was fond of saying that there was no way to fool a hammer.
Just this once she hoped he was wrong.

"You just about done?"
She jumped at Iñacio's voice.

"Hope so," she said briskly,
promising herself mentally that she would never watch another horror sim again.
"Let's hook 'em up."

Long before there were buses and hovercraft there were ox-carts and chariots.
Iffy didn't know if anyone had ever built one to be pulled by two sentry robots,
but if so,
she was pretty sure they hadn't made it out of
a heavy-duty dolly and fiber optic cables.
She nudged it skeptically with her boot.
The frictionless bearings in its wheels were undamaged,
so it would roll enough,
but even without the schematics in her head
she could see that it would want to slip, tip, or flip
at every bump and corner.

Iñacio took a moment to say a few quiet words over what was left of Arno Severin,
then lowered himself gingerly onto the dolly beside her.
A plastic crate full of tools sat beside her,
and another one with weapons and spare parts for the bots nestled under his elbow.
None of the weapons had responded to their touch,
but they would still add useful weight.

The Ecologist looked at her and grinned.
She grinned back.
"Yip yip!" she said,
snapping the cables she had rigged as reins.
("So that I'll have somethin' t' hold onto,"
she had told Iñacio,
who had nodded straight-faced in response.)

The bots didn't move.
Iffy sighed.
"Forward one quarter speed," she ordered.
The dolly jerked beneath her as the bots set off at a trot into the tunnel.
Iñacio thumbed a handlight and pointed it ahead of them.

"Increase speed to one half."
The dolly's wheels made a sizzling sound as they rolled faster into the unknown.

Iffy had expected the tunnel to be level,
but instead it rose and fell with a kilometer-long rhythm.
"For drainage?" Iñacio hazarded,
though the floor was desert dry.

After half an hour her back was aching and her backside had gone numb.
She was about to suggest that they stop to stretch
when the two sentry bots pulled up short.
"Whoa!" she squawked as the dolly smacked hard into their hind legs.

The bots ignored her.
Their heads twitched this way and that in an almost birdlike way.
The one that had hesitated before accepting her orders took a step and stopped.
Without warning a panel on its back flipped open
and something stubby and lethal looking popped up.

Iñacio swore under his breath and reached for the crate beside him.
The gun on the bot's back spun around to point at him.
"Aright, aright," the Ecologist said,
raising both hands.

He caught Iffy's eye and jerked his head backward.
She nodded,
then swivelled slowly to the side and put her boots on the concrete.
When Neither of the bots moved
she slid forward and slowly stood up.

Metal clicked on concrete somewhere in the darkness ahead of them.
The bot's gun spun around again.
"Easy, easy," Iñacio said soothingly as he got to his feet as well.
"I'll just get all this off you an'—nope, nope, ne'er mind."
He let go of the cables he had gathered up in one hand and stepped back.
The bot's gun tracked his motion for one extra warning second
before spinning around to point into the darkness once again.

"I think—" Iffy started,
biting off her words when Iñacio flashed the flat-palmed handsign that meant "quiet".
*I think it's the other bot,*
she finished in her head.
She closed her eyes and tried to slow her breathing.
Nothing:
no images flashed into her mind
and no thoughts suddenly emerged fully-formed.

Metal clicked on concrete again.
Her eyes snapped open.
The sound was *behind* them this time.

She and Iñacio turned in unison.
The light in the Ecologist's hand reflected off three—no, four—bots
like the pair that had been pulling the dolly.
One was missing part of a foreleg.
Another's side was deeply dented
as if something had tried to punch right through it,
and all four bore more scratches and scars than Iffy could count.

The lead bot took a step toward them.
"Hey now," Iñacio cautioned.
"We ain't lookin' for trouble."

"Ssh."
Iffy studied the bot.
"I don't think it wants t' hurt us.
Matter o' fact…"
She raised both her hands,
turned around slowly,
and reached into the crate of tools she had packed earlier.

"F'real?" Iñacio muttered disbelievingly.

"You got a better idea?" she shot back under her breath.
An adjustable wrench,
a screw jack that might be able to outdent the bot's side—what she really needed
was Mister Mishra's shop and Johnson Wales' toolbox,
but these would have to do.

She turned around to face the bots and held the tools out.
"Aright?" she asked.

None of the bots moved.
For one panicked moment Iffy thought she had guessed wrong,
but then the bot that had stepped forward took two more steps toward her
and lowered itself into a crouch.

"We don't have time for this,"
Iñacio said quietly a moment later.

"Tell them that,"
Iffy replied absently.
These bots had been built to be scouts and guards and weapons.
The blunt claws on the ends of their legs could pick up a rock
or grab hold of someone's arm,
but were no good for delicate work.
Scratches and dents on the bot's inner frame showed
where they had tried to repair each other anyway.

"Gimme the crate,"
she said over her shoulder.
"Please."
Iñacio lifted it off the dolly and set it down beside her without comment.

Wire,
a crimping tool that she could use to cut it,
a screwdriver with a torsion readout built into its handle—there.
She patted the bot's back.
"Good as new."
Which was a lie,
but felt like the right thing to say.

The bot stood,
braced its legs,
and shivered through a rapid self-test.
When the reflex capacitor that Iffy had just wired into place didn't rattle
it made a soft, incongruous *ping*
and stepped aside to make room for another member of its pack.

Iffy put her tools back in the crate and stood.
"I'm sorry,"
she said.
"We gotta keep movin',
but if you wanna come with us
I'll fix you when we get somewhere safe."

The bots didn't move.
"We really gotta go,"
Iff said,
turning to pick up her crate.

A clawed foreleg closed around her arm.
"Hey!"
She smacked it with her hand.
"None o' that, aright?"

The bot released her but didn't back up.
She glanced at the two still in harness and frowned.
"Pass me a cable,"
she said to Iñacio.
"I have an idea."

The bots didn't have collars,
but a lifetime at sea had taught Iffy dozens of ways to tie a knot.
She left plenty of slack so that the bots could pull their heads out if they needed to.

When she was done,
the three bots that had all of their legs waited patiently in a line behind the dolly,
the cable loops around their necks.
Iñacio shook his head.
"Nagatha's never gonna believe this."

Iffy grinned.
"Come on, you," she said to the fourth bot.
"Up you get."
She put her hand where its neck would have been and tugged it forward.
Limping,
it clambered up onto the dolly and crouched down
where Iffy and Iñacio had been sitting.

"Nope, nope, not there."
She tugged it again,
then sighed when it didn't move.
"Aright,
stay there if you want to—we'll get a better view up front anyway."

"Can we go now?"
Iñacio asked testily.

Iffy nodded.
"Yip yip!"
The bots in front of them didn't move.
"Worth a try," she muttered.

"Forward one quarter speed,"
Iñacio ordered.
A moment later they were rolling through the tunnel once again
with three of the new bots following single file behind them.

Iffy leaned back gingerly.
The crippled bot on the dolly rotated its head to study her.
After a moment she draped an arm over its back to steady herself.
It wasn't actually more comfortable than just sitting upright,
but it was somehow more comforting.

She didn't notice the extra clattering at first.
Or rather,
she wasn't the first to notice that
there was more sound behind them than there should be.

She snapped out of her daze when the three sentry bots
trotting in step in the dolly's wake pulled up short.
"Shad!"
The dolly smacked hard into the hind legs of the ones in front,
who had stopped two mechanical strides later.
Six boxy clusters of sensors and cameras swivelled
to point back the way they had come.

That's when Iffy heard it:
the rhythmic *clunk clunk clunk* of exoskeletoned feet on concrete.
Iñacio was already on his feet
with something that looked like a high-pressure paint sprayer in his hands.
"Only thing that doesn't have a lock-out,"
he said.

Iffy was already unlooping the cables around the bots' necks.
"Listen,"
she said,
squatting in front of the one she had repaired
so that her head and its sensors were on the same level.
"I know we're not who you were s'posed t' be guardin',
but those folk back there?
They're *really* not s'posed t' be here."
She fished the screwdriver out of her pocket and held it up.
"You fix that an' I promise,
I'll do my best t' fix you all."

She had no reason to believe the bot could understand her.
Its core had probably been imprinted with a dog's mind
like Doctor Johel's armored G-80 back in Rothera.
There was no telling what strange loops it might have formed
in the century it had spent patrolling these abandoned tunnels.
For all she knew it would take one look at the Marines
and decide they were its true masters.

The bot took a step forward and to butted her gently with its head,
then turned and disappeared into the darkness
with its two companions at its heels.

The fourth bot rose onto its three good legs.
It didn't make a sound,
but Iffy imagined that if it could have whined it would have.
"They'll be aright,"
she told it as she took her seat on the dolly,
wishing she believed her own words.

The first explosion echoed through the tunnel a few minutes later.
"Increase speed to full,"
Iñacio snapped at the harnessed bots.
Gunfire chattered behind them—Iffy couldn't tell how far away—and then
the sound-shock of another explosion rolled past them.

"Get down!" she ordered
The three-legged bot had risen to its feet again,
its body swaying slightly as its algorithms steadied its misbalanced weight
atop the dolly.

"I said get—affin' heck, look out!"
Iffy ducked
as the three-legged bot jumped over her.
The dolly slewed wildly,
skidded,
and straightened out.

The tunnel was climbing now,
a long steady incline that Iffy hoped would lead to
the surface or the secret Niobium base
or whatever it had been built to distract from.
The first painted stripe on the wall flew past so quickly that
she wasn't sure she had seen it.
A second, then a third with a six-digit number stenciled next to it,
and then the tunnel leveled out and automatic lights came on over their heads,
turning everything the dark red she associated with night watches.

The bots slowed and stopped
as the dolly rolled into a dimly-lit space several times larger
than the bunker they had left.
A blast door slid closed behind them,
metal scraping on stone for the first time in a century.
They had arrived.

"Lights on?" Iñacio said after a moment.
"*Acendé luz?*
*Lampo roshan kon?*"

The three-legged bot made a high-pitched whining sound.
Iffy squinted as clinically-white strips in the walls and ceiling obediently lit up,
then sucked in her breath.
She had hoped they would find a workshop
and feared it would be a graveyard,
but this—she hadn't expected this.

Six thick cylinders lay on their sides in two rows of three,
each one surrounded by pipes and machinery.
A bulky mass made of meter-square bricks loomed in the background.
The three-armed logo painted on its side was redundant:
even before schematics took shape in her head
she recognized the reactor for what it was.

One of the cylinders had been opened.
She and Iñacio exchanged looks.
He nodded as if to answer a question she hadn't asked,
then hefted the thing that looked like a paint sprayer
and edged forward cautiously.

She held her breath as he neared the cylinder,
only letting it out when he glanced inside and lowered the sprayer.
"'S empty," he said,
sounding as relieved as she felt.
"An' look—one o' th' suits is missin' too."
He gestured at the wall to their left
where five silvered body suits hung from swing-out racks
in front of matching boots and helmets.

"Stay here,"
Iffy told the bots.
Singh, Velikov, DiOrio, Yuen, Boghosian—and Johnson.
The label above the missing suit read "Johnson",
but what did "High Medina" mean,
and where had she seen that logo before?
A red circle with a green crescent set into it,
a four-pointed white star…

"They were Martians!" she blurted.
"It was in one o' my history sims.
Some trillionaire gave up on fixin' th' world
an' wanted t' run away t' Mars.
They got a few rockets up b'fore space got affed up
an' then—"
She shrugged,
slightly embarrassed by how excited she had momentarily sounded.
Honesty had teased her once about being a space geek
and she had never mentioned it to der again.
"Th' machine wars started an' nobody ever heard anythin' more from them."

Iñacio nodded, stony-faced.
"I know th' story.
Coulda saved a million trees or a million lives
with what they spent tryin' t' get away from what they'd done."
He hefted the sprayer again,
and for a moment she thought he might use it on the empty cylinder.
"You ever meet any o' my folk an' they call you an astronaut,
it ain't a compliment."

"But what're they doin' here?"
Iffy walked past the motionless bots harnessed to the dolly
and ran a finger along one of the unopened cylinders.
"An' who's been cleanin' this all these years?"

The crippled bot on the dolly surged to its feet.
The panel on its back flipped open.
A stubby needle gun popped up.
Its targeting laser drew a thin red line through the air
to a squat four-wheeled service bot
that had just rolled into view from somewhere further back in the chamber.

The service bot froze and made a warbling sound.
The three-legged bot tilted its head toward Iffy.
"Um, sure," she said helplessly.
The laser blinked off,
but the sentry bot stayed on its feet
as the service bot began to wipe down the nearest cylinder
with a brush whose bristles had long since worn away.

Iñacio swiped an app set into a work table next to one of the cylinders
and studied the displays that appeared.
"Reconciliation Team Beta,"
he read aloud.
"Alpha's in a shelter east o' here
an' Gamma 'n' Delta are 'round th' other way."
He frowned.
"This doesn't make any sense.
They all have cryogenization an' the same date,
but then decryogenization on different dates."

"So they all got unfrozen at different times,"
Iffy said,
shrugging.

Iñacio shook his head.
"That's what's weird about it.
Accordin' to this,
they all got unfrozen *before* they were frozen, not after."
He cleared his throat.
"And,
um,
those five?
They all got a flag beside their names that says 'nonviable'.
Only one marked green is Johnson."

Iffy hunched her shoulders inside her parka and shivered.
She was hungry and needed a bathroom
and she was tired of being in places where people were dead.
"That thing show you a way outta here?"

The Ecologist shrugged.
"Th' tunnel that way gets us to Alpha,
or we can go th' other way to Gamma.
There's another one into th' Niobium thing,
an' from there we can get to whatever's in th' middle of all this.
'Scuse me."
He stepped aside to let the service bot roll past him on its rounds.

He looked as tired as she felt,
Iffy realized,
and felt a pang for not having thought about it before.
"Maybe there's bunks in back or somethin'?" she hazarded.

"Nah."
Iñacio shook his head.
"This place wasn't for workin' or livin'.
This was a warehouse.
An' anyway,
we gotta keep movin'.
Those bots mighta slowed th' Marines down,
but they won't'a stopped 'em."

Iffy *really* wanted a bathroom,
but she had once stood an eight-hour watch on the *Guinevere*
when Aunt Naggie was sick
without a single break
despite six cups of tea.
"Th' hell with whatever they were doin' down here,"
she said.
"Let's get to th' base and figure out a way outta this mess."

The service bot pivoted on its wheels to face her.
"The way out is simple, Citizen Kwan,"
a familiar voice said.
"All you have to do is stay where you are
so that my team can collect you without any more theatrics.
Your friend goes about his business,
you help me with mine,
and we all get a happy ending."

Iñacio hefted the sprayer and aimed it at the bot.
"Now, now,"
the governor's voice chided.
"I have no idea if that still works and neither do you.
Even if it does,
you're sixty meters underground and breathing recycled air.
Do you really want to set things on fire?"

Iñacio hesitated.
"I s'pose not," he said,
setting it down beside the dolly.
And then casually,
as if it was the most natural thing in the world,
he slipped the loops of cables off the two sentry bots harnessed that had been pulling them
and shouted,
"Get 'em!"

The bots didn't move.

The governor's voice chuckled.
"Did you really think that would—"

"Target!"
Iffy snapped,
pointing.
The gun on the back of the three-legged bot barked twice.
The first shot punched a hole through the service bot.
The second caught it off-center and sent it spinning across the floor.

"What—"
Iñacio started.

"You just gotta know how t' talk to 'em,"
Iffy said,
grabbing a couple of tools out of her crate and stuffing them into her pockets.
"C'mon.
We gotta get a leg on."

The tunnel at the other end of the bunker had a blast door
to match the one that had closed behind them.
Iffy closed her eyes and rooted around in her not-memories of this place.
There.
She traced a shape on a contact pad beside the door,
then gasped as it slid open to reveal a pair of Marines,
their gun-arms pointed straight at her and Iñacio.

"Oh rabbit,"
the governor's voice said,
and for a moment Iffy could almost believe the sympathy in his voice was genuine.
"Did you really think you could find a hole deep enough to hide from *me*?"

Iffy felt rather than saw the three-legged bot begin to move.
"No!" she shouted,
lunging to stop it
as if it was a pet rat or a drone she had just spent hours building out of spare parts.
Its gun fired twice
but it was already falling as the Marines' auto-targeted shots
hit the knee joint in its remaining front leg.

She was falling too.
Something had knocked the breath out of her.
She was lying on the concrete and it *hurt*,
it hurt so much that she couldn't even cry out,
not yet,
because the shot had gone right through her
just above her hip
and when she tried to breathe it felt like someone was kneeling on her back
and squeezing all the air out of her.

Iñacio was shouting her name.
She was pretty sure it was Iñacio.
She could hear the governor's voice barking order too.
"No, don't," she tried to say
as exoskeletoned arms picked her up,
but the words came out as a gasp
and now she could breathe again
and the hurt spread through her like milk poured into tea.

Her head lolled to the side as the Marine placed her on a nearby work table.
Iñacio was shouting and struggling to free himself from the other Marine's grip,
which was working about as well as the time
she had tried to pull herself free from Aunt Naggie
after having her first and only temper tantrum outside the Sandhus' shop
when she was eight years old.
She couldn't remember what she had wanted so badly,
but it didn't matter.

The Marine who had picked her up had put a patch on her arm
to take the pain away
except it was more like taking her away from the pain.
She floated inside her own body as if it was a warm bath
while the Marine sliced open her parka with a very sharp knife
and squeezed cold pink goo into the hole der needle gun had made.
She supposed she was lucky it had been an armor-piercing round.
She didn't think the Marine would have enough goo to fill
the hole that the other kind would have made.

*«unanticipated / unforeseen»*

"Oh there you are."
She didn't know if she had said the words out loud or not.
*Are you going to shoot me too?*

*«inspection»*

The machine thought was clouded and soft-edged instead of crystal clear.
Without warning she was suspended beside a schematic of herself,
alone in a pocket universe constructed solely for this temporary purpose.
The fractalized patches of cells scattered through her body glistened blue-white,
but there and there and there they were red,
red for danger,
red like the blood on the work table underneath her.
They would heal—the tweaks in her genes were quadruply redundant to make sure of that—but
healing would take time
and that was something she/they/the world didn't have enough of right now.

"Sh sh sh," the Marine said softly.
An armored hand brushed gently against her cheek.
Her last thought before all her thoughts went away was,
*Honesty?*

She woke in a bed—an actual bed with sheets,
not a cot or a bunk or her sleeping bag.
Gray light came through a small window set high in the wall.
It was probably too small for her to get through anyway,
she thought dully.
She frowned.
Why would she need to—oh.

She sat up and winced.
Someone had replaced her clothes with gray cotton shorts
and a matching tank top.
The bandage stuck to her stomach,
on the other hand,
was a bright, shiny blue.
She slid her hand gingerly around to her back
and felt a matching square there.

A pair of slippers waited patiently on the floor.
She turned,
wincing again,
and slid her feet into them.
Could she stand?
Yes.
She wasn't even light-headed,
though she was as thirsty as she'd ever been.
And she didn't need a bathroom nearly as much as she had
before she'd been shot,
which made her wonder about exactly what kind of care she might have received
while she was unconscious.

A dressing gown hung on the back of the door.
It was locked,
of course,
but even if it hadn't been
she wasn't quite ready to face whatever lay on its other side.
She had been *shot*.
She could have died,
and—

She sniffled angrily and wiped her face on the dressing gown.
She really had thought they could escape,
and now she just felt stupid.

She lay back down on the bed (carefully) and closed her eyes.
A moment later she squeezed her lids shut more tightly,
but it didn't help.
The schematic of herself wasn't there any more.
Nothing was,
not even a simple wireframe of a hammer.
All she could see was the dots and swirls that everyone saw behind their eyelids.

Something cold stirred in her belly.
Maybe the loss was temporary.
Maybe things had just gone back to the way they were
and images would appear when they wanted to instead of on demand.
Or maybe it was gone for good and she could get on with her life,
though she knew it couldn't ever be what it had been.
She had wanted so much to move on,
to go somewhere and be someone and have an adventure,
and now that it had actually happened she still wanted all of that,
she just wanted a choice
instead of having things happen to her.
Mysteries,
it turned out,
were a lot more fun in sims.

She didn't know who to expect if the door opened.
The governor?
If so, which one?
Not that it seemed to matter much.
Would it be Iñacio,
looking worried,
or Johnson Wales with an apology?
Or would it be Honesty?
She was pretty sure the Marine who had given her first aid
hadn't actually been Honesty,
just another teenager with a narrow chin and button nose
temporarily possessed by someone who had been dead longer than
the people frozen in the bunker had been waiting for someone to defrost their remains.

She was still thirsty,
but she was tired too,
so she closed her eyes and let sleep take her away.

She woke in an actual bed with sheets
rather than her sleeping bag on the *Guinevere*.
Gray light came through a small window high in the wall.
She sat up and winced.
Someone had dressed her in gray cotton shorts and a matching tank top.
The bandage stuck to her stomach was bright blue.
She felt on her back,
somehow already knowing she would find a matching one there.

She slid her feet into the slippers waiting on the floor
and frowned as she took the dressing gown from the back of the door
and slid her arms into the sleeves.
She had never worn slippers or a dressing gown in her life—she only knew them
from Aunt Naggie's romance sims.
But it all felt somehow familiar,
as did her thirst.

She sat back down on the bed and closed her eyes,
willing a schematic of herself to appear.
Nothing happened.
All she could see was the dots and swirls that everyone saw.

*Phosphenes,* she thought.
They were called phosphenes,
but how did she know that?
Panic roiled in her gut,
cold and slippery as if she had somehow swallowed a live jellyfish.

That thought pulled her back to her feet.
She knew the door would be locked,
but she tested the handle anyway.
"Well shad," she said aloud as it opened with a faint click.

The hall outside was as featureless as her room.
The floor was tiled with squares of slate-colored linoleum
just like the ones in the Sandhus' store.
The walls and ceiling were iceberg gray.
She couldn't see where the light was coming from
or how far the corridor went:
it seemed to stretch away forever in both directions.
The doors were rectangular outlines with handles
identical to the one that had just closed behind her with another faint click.

"Hello?"
She took a step, then hesitated.
She was sure the lettering on the door opposite her hadn't been there a moment before.
Was it motion-sensitive?
She stepped back:
the letters stayed visible.
They definitely *were* letters,
so why couldn't she read them?

"Hello?" she said again.
Her words disappeared without an echo as if she had never spoken,
but now she could hear something in the distance
like the steady *shush shush shush* of waves against the side of a ship.
That sound had been a constant background in her life
for as long as she could remember,
just like the smell of the sea.

The smell.
She could smell the ocean.
Wherever she was,
she was close to salt water.
Halley?
Rothera?
Another secret hideout somewhere?
There seemed to be a surprising number of those scattered around Antarctica,
although to be honest,
she wasn't really sure how many would have been unsurprising.

She hesitated again before grasping the handle in front of her.
It resisted for a moment, then turned with a click and pulled it open.

The room inside was identical to the one she had woken up in,
right down to the rumpled sheet on the bed.
All of a sudden she was tired as well as thirsty,
so she lay down on it and closed her eyes and let sleep take her away.

She woke in an actual bed with sheets.
Gray light came through a small window.
The bandage stuck to her stomach under her gray cotton tank top was bright blue.
Its twin tugged at the skin on her back
as she kicked the slippers on the floor aside and opened the door.
The hall outside was tiled with slate-colored linoleum squares.
*Just like the Sandhus',* she thought.
The light came from nowhere in particular,
painting the walls and ceiling iceberg gray.

The door behind her closed with a faint click.
There was lettering on the door opposite her,
but opening it felt—she lowered her hand.
She and Jeep had played hive a few times.
The thought of opening the door gave her the same feeling as
the thought of placing a piece exactly where her opponent wanted her to.

The corridor stretched away to infinity in both directions.
Waves shushed in the distance
and the tang of salt water tickled her nose
as she considered her options.
It all seemed familiar.
How many times had she been here before?
How many of these doors had she opened,
only to find herself back in the room she had left?

Sometimes the only way to win was not to play.
She sat on the floor with her back against the wall and closed her eyes.
Phosphenes danced behind her eyelids.
She hugged herself so that her hands were hidden in her armpits
and pinched hard.
That felt real,
but that didn't mean anything.
If this was some kind of virtual reality,
whatever machine she was plugged into could simulate a pinch
just as easily as it could make her believe
there was a wall behind her back
or that she was thirsty.

"I ain't playin' no more," she said aloud.
The corridor swallowed her words without even a trace of an echo.
She wrapped her arms around her knees and put her head down on her knees to wait.

Her shoulders tensed involuntarily when she heard a door open somewhere in the distance.
She kept her head down as footsteps approached.
Fabric rustled as someone sat opposite her.

"You really are quite extraordinary,"
the governor said without preamble.
"If circumstances were different I would probably offer you a job of some sort."
He chuckled.
"I suspect that if I did that,
I would be working for *you* in rather short order."

Iffy didn't move.

"I'm not actually a villain,"
the governor continued gently.
"I admit I've done some terrible things,
but every single one of them was absolutely necessary.
Things are getting worse,
Citizen Kwan,
and we still can't see the bottom of the pit.
Every time we think we've patched a hole in the world,
entropy breaks through in a dozen other places.
Your ecologist and his friends think they can save enough to start over,
but simulation after simulation says they're wrong.
Even the machines seem to be afraid these days,
though what they seem to be afraid of most,
surprisingly,
is you."

Fabric rustled again as he stood.
"For what it's worth,
I'm sorry.
If there was another way to do this—"

Iffy waited for him to finish his sentence.
The moment stretched and stretched.
"Are you gonna kill me?"
she asked,
her voice muffled by her knees.

"No,"
the governor said neutrally.
"You're just not going to be yourself for a while."
He sighed.
"Quite a long while, in fact.
Goodbye, Citizen Kwan.
Believe it or not,
it has been a pleasure."

Without warning her thirst was back,
more powerful than ever before.
She was almost grateful as she fell into something deeper and darker than sleep.

## Chapter 12

Sandrine Kibbens woke up in a hospital bed.
The room was unfamiliar,
but the tech supervising her transcription had warned her that would be the case.
"Take a few moments to collect yourself,"
de had said,
so that's what Sandrine did.
She had been following orders ever since she joined the Augmented Infantry,
and to her surprise she had found that
she enjoyed letting other people make decisions for her.

Core, then peripherals:
she had learned that the first time she had donned an exoskeleton.
Her heartbeat was steady,
even though it wasn't really hers.
She couldn't explain the difference,
but something deep in the back of her brain knew that
the muscle thudding in her chest wasn't the one she had known all her life.

She drew a deep breath,
held it,
and exhaled slowly.
Her lungs seemed fine,
though she could feel a recent injury in her abdomen.
Through and through,
if she wasn't mistaken,
just like the one that had killed her for the first time in Auckland.

Sandrine scrunched her toes.
They felt stubby—was this body really that much smaller than her original?
She pushed the question aside,
grateful that she didn't appear to have any spinal injuries,
and drummed her fingers against her thighs.
One two three four thumb,
one four two three thumb—good.
She had lost some fine motor control the second time she died.
It was nice to have it back.

The monitoring cuff around her wrist was wireless,
so she rolled onto her side.
This body was definitely female,
but also definitely young.
And it—she—was thirsty and needed a bathroom.

Sandrine sat up.
"Hello?" she called.

The door slid open.
Without thinking she rolled sideways,
tossing the sheet into the air for whatever momentary distraction it might provide
and dropping into a fighting crouch.

"At ease, corporal," said the elderly man standing in the doorway
behind the bot that had just rolled into her room.
"It's all right—this one's safe.
It's just going to check your vitals.
Here."
He held out a cup of something that she desperately hoped was actually chocolate.
"And if you need the necessary,
it's…"
He gestured at a panel on the wall beside her.

Sandrine straightened up.
"Sorry, sir.
Old habit."
He was wearing civilian clothes—a formal black turtleneck and a matching black kameez
over loose-fitting trousers—but "sir" seemed safest for now.

The old man nodded.
"Completely understandable.
I'm Governor Stern, by the way,
and you're in Antarctica.
It's been a little over a hundred years since you were recorded,
so you'll have a lot to catch up on.
There's an app on the table there,
and I'll have some mango noodles sent down when you're ready."

"Thank you, sir."
Sandrine hesitated.
"If I may ask—who am I sharing with right now?"

"Mm."
The governor pursed his lips.
"Her name is Ang Kwang—Fifth Ang Kwan, to be precise—and
she is a much more complicated person than I first realized.
I'm hoping you can help with that."
He held out the cup of chocolate again.
After a moment's hesitation,
Sandrine reached over the waist-high bot waiting patiently to examine her
and took it from him.

There wasn't much on the app,
but she hadn't really expected there would be.
It said the machine wars had ended in a draw,
though the list of things humanity was no longer allowed to do
made it pretty clear who had actually won.
No flying.
(She would miss that,
assuming she lasted in this body long enough to miss things.)
No one could manufacture new cores smarter than—she tapped the description—smarter than parrots or monkeys.
She felt a brief pang as a second layer of popups informed her that
both were now extinct,
but pushed it away.
That wasn't part of her mission unless and until someone told her it was,
and anyway,
she had only ever seen either in videos.

An animated map showed the retreat of the ice cap in Greenland and Antarctica
and the corresponding inward creep of shorelines elsewhere in the world.
Some of the atolls they had used as staging posts during the war
were now completely under water,
but all that extra water hadn't stopped forests from turning into plains
and plains into deserts.
She started to zoom in on Melbourne,
then closed the map
and tried doing a few pushups.
Her muscles was in pretty good shape,
but her body was so skinny—whatever had made Ang Kwan special
didn't seem to have included eating three square meals a day.

She felt a gut-deep sense of relief when a Marine showed up a few minutes later
with a bowl full of noodles and a freshly-printed uniform for her to wear.
The fleshy yellow chunks on the noodles weren't any kind of mango she recognized,
but the food was warm and filling
and the uniform fit perfectly.

"It suits you," the Marine said as she tucked the cuffs of her trousers
into the tops of her socks.

"Thank you, sergeant."
She twisted from side to side to crack her spine.
"May I ask…?"

"Paolo Vassilenko," the Marine said.
"I was imprinted three months ago.
It took well—I can access most of my host's original memories when I need to,
and there haven't been any stutters or seizures to speak of."

Sandrine nodded.
"How long do they think you'll last?"

The Marine shrugged.
"Call-up is supposed to be a year,
but some of the others have been re-imprinted a couple of times.
They check us pretty carefully before doing it,"
he added hastily.
"If the host is showing any distress they're done and out."

Sandrine nodded again.
"Anyone around that you knew your first time around?"

The man who was currently Paola Vassilenko smiled.
"Yeah, I got lucky.
Nobody plays chess any more,
but a couple of the guys I served with in Newfoundland are in body right now,
so we get together and have a few games whenever we can.
I don't suppose you play?"

Sandrine shook her head.
"Sorry."

"No worries—maybe in the next life."
The Marine stepped aside and gestured at the door.
"After you?"

Less had changed in a hundred years than Sandrine had expected.
She wondered if that was because of the machines' restrictions on new inventions
or whether there just weren't a lot of ways to improve on
the design of an underground secret base.
Corridors painted in neutral colors with cryptic labels painted on the walls,
grilled stairs that echoed under her boots,
the metal-on-metal whine of a saw in a machine shop as she passed a half-open door—it
was all very familiar.
She couldn't have said how she knew she was underground
any more than she could have explained how she had known that her heart wasn't her own.
She just accepted it as part of her mission,
wondering as Sergeant Vassilenko rapped his knuckles on a door
how many copies of hers had accepted it before.

"Enter."
The sergeant opened the door and nodded for her to go through,
turning to stand at attention in the hall as it swung close.

"Hello again, corporal.
This will just take a moment."
The governor gestured at a comfortable-looking chair opposite his desk
without looking up from the app in his hands.

She sat on the edge of the seat,
her back straight and her hands folded neatly in her lap.
"What do you know about the Niobium project?" the governor asked.

Sandrine shook her head.
"Never heard of it, sir."

"Mm.
Not surprising—it was just getting started in your time.
Here."
He swiped a scene from his app onto the wall beside them.
"Low Earth orbit was a disaster area.
There was so much shrapnel from old satellites and what-not that
people basically gave up on trying to plot routes through it.
They just threw armor on everything and billed for the extra weight.
But up here, up past geosynchronous orbit in retrograde space, well…"
Green curves formed around the slowly-turning globe,
safely outside the sparkling chaff closer in.

The governor sighed.
"They planned a hundred and ninety two satellites.
As far as we know,
only half were built before things fell apart.
The machines tried to take them over,
but even they were locked out."

"And you believe Citizen Kwan can unlock them?"
Sandrine asked after a moment of silence.

"What?
Oh no,
I doubt it."
The governor chuckled and swiped the display into oblivion.
"I mean,
it would be rather nice if she could,
but that's not what we need from her—or from you,
I should say.
You see,
as big as it was,
Niobium was just a cover for something else—something
that has the machines and my clones all rather worried."

Sandrine filed the mention of clones away.
"Then may I ask, sir, how I can be of service?"

Another swipe on the app put a human form on the wall.
Short,
skinny,
female,
with a recent puncture wound through her abdomen highlighted in red
and something else scattered through her,
something blobbish and silvery like spilled mercury.

"Citizen Kwan—she prefers Iffy, by the way—well,
she has some rather interesting modifications to her genome.
The first clone in her lineage seems to have been born
just as Niobium was picking up speed,
and then of course there's this."

Another swipe,
another image,
this one a hologram of six cryogenic capsules in a domed chamber.
The word "nonviable" floated over five of them.
A man's face hovered beside the sixth.
"It's all rather a mystery,"
the governor mused,
resting his chin on his steepled hands.
"What I'd like you to do is unravel it for me."

"I'm afraid I'm not much good at puzzles, sir,"
Sandrine said.
"Volleyball was more my thing."

"Mm, yes, of course."
The governor straightened up.
"But that was when you were *you*,
as it were.
Right now,
you're in a body that seems to be able to pull information out of thin air.
I'm hoping that if you can master that ability,
you'll be able to get the answers I need."

"Yes sir."
Sandrine nodded as if she understood.
"And how will I do that, sir?"

"Oh, yes."
The governor sighed.
"I'm afraid that's the unpleasant part.
We don't actually know,
and we're rather short on time,
so we're going to have to give you a bit of help."

Years and lifetimes ago,
Sandrine had been taught that torture was ineffective as well as evil.
She therefore wasn't surprised that when
Sergeant Vassilenko led her downstairs and strapped her into a chair,
what followed was a simple injection
rather than something involving clubs, canvas bags, and electrodes.

The panic that followed was very real, though.
She knew it was just the effect of whatever drug she had been given,
but the word "just" didn't really feel appropriate.
She panted for breath as if she had just been running through the desert under fire.
She had to get away.
She knew she was safe,
but "she" wasn't in control any longer.

Her heart—no, it wasn't hers, it was Ang Kwan's, but that didn't matter—it
was pounding inside her chest.
She looked wide-eyed at Sergeant Vassilenko.
"What am I supposed to do now?"

He shrugged apologetically.
"I'm sorry,
I wasn't told.
It should wear off in a few minutes."
He consulted the app on the stand beside the chair,
which wasn't as comfortable as the one in the governor's office
even though it reclined.
She tried to focus on that,
and on other little details in the room,
just like she had been trained to.
How many drawers in the stainless steel cabinet on her left?
Four.
How many light panels above her?
Two,
one of which should probably be replaced.
She drummed her fingers against her thighs.
One two three four thumb,
one four—was two three or three two next?
Start over.
One two three four—no.
Focus.
One two—

The whining sound she was hearing was coming from her,
she realized.
She swallowed hard to stop it,
but that interrupted her breathing
and now she was panting again.
She couldn't fill her lungs.
She needed to get her arms out of the straps.
She needed to run away,
run away from all of it,
but she couldn't.

"Aaand that's time."
Sergeant Vassilenko peeled the back off a patch
and pressed it against her neck.
Her heart began to slow almost immediately.

Sandrine took a deep breath,
then another.
After the third,
she squeezed her hands into fists and slowly, deliberately relaxed them.
"Can I please have some water, sergeant?"
she asked once she was sure her voice would be under her control.

Wordlessly,
Sergeant Vassilenko held a bottle to her lips.
She sucked a mouthful through the straw,
swished it around,
and swallowed.
She tugged her arms against the straps.
"Don't suppose you can undo these?"

"I'm afraid not, corporal."
The governor's voice seemed to come from nowhere.
He really was just like the villain from *The Last Days of Cairo*,
she thought giddily.
Did anyone else still remember that show?

"May I—"
She coughed and tried again.
"May I ask why not, sir?"

"We imprint a little more deeply here than most places,"
the governor said briskly.
"For security, you understand—having original personalities surface at the wrong moment
could be quite problematic at a facility like this,
particularly in the present circumstances.
Unfortunately,
that's going to make it quite a bit harder for you
to access Citizen Kwan's memories and, um, abilities.
As I said,
we're rather short on time,
so we can't afford the mental equivalent of a long siege.
But you've taken part in frontal assaults before—I'm confident
that you will survive this one."

"Thank you, sir."
It seemed a completely inadequate response,
but what else was she going to say?

She caught Sergeant Vassilenko's eye.
"Ready when you are," she lied.

The governor didn't bother to check in after the next session,
or after any of those that followed it.
Finally,
several hours later,
whoever or whatever was monitoring Sandrine told Sergeant Vassilenko to stop.
"How are you doing?" he asked
as he undid the straps and handed her a bottle of water.

"I've been better,"
she said.
"I imagine I've been worse, too."
She wondered if he knew how many times she had been imprinted
and what had happened to those temporary copies of her.
There had been stories when she was alive
of entire battalions made up of just one person,
and imprints that had gone wrong in a dozen different ways,
each more cinematic than the last.

She handed back the now-empty bottle and stood.
The patches on Ang Kwan's injury tugged at her skin,
but everything else felt fine.
She was going to have bruises from the straps,
though,
and her uniform smelled of sweat.

"There's plenty of hot water,"
Sergeant Vassilenko said as if he had read her mind.
"If you want to clean up,
I'll see if I can get you something more interesting than noodles for dinner."

She stood in the shower for a long time,
enjoying the feeling of water against the stubble on her scalp.
Dinner was grilled tofu in an unidentifiable citrus sauce,
bok choi,
broccoli,
and potatoes.
She chewed each mouthful a dozen times
as she swiped through videos of volleyball games on the little app in her room.
It wasn't quite the game she remembered—players were apparently now allowed
to use bats as well as their hands—but it was the distraction she needed.

Later,
lying in the dark as she waited for sleep to come,
she realized that she hadn't ever asked what had happened to her
after she had been recorded.

*got married an' raised sheep an' a family on th' south island*

The thought didn't appear out of nowhere.
It was just *there* in her head as if it always had been.
Noticing it felt like realizing that the socks or keys she had been searching for
had been on the table in front of her the whole time.

*Citizen Kwan?* she thought cautiously.
Nothing happened.

*Ang? Iffy?*
She tried to visualize the face she now wore,
then relaxed her hands,
which had balled themselves into fists.
If you wanted to see something in dim light,
you couldn't look straight at it.
You had to look a little to the side.

She rolled onto her side and ran a hand over her scalp.
She would have to shave soon,
though if she was going to be around for more than a few days
she could try letting it grow out.
She had worn her hair down past her shoulderblades when she was Iffy's age.
She and her friends had braided it in ever-more-complicated ways,
cursing each other good-naturedly for the tangles they made.

*musta been nice t' have friends like that*

It had been.
Her family had been relocated to Hobart
when storms battering Brisbane went from a monthly to a weekly occurrence.
"Temporarily" became "for the duration of the emergency",
and by the time she was old enough to ride her treasured bamboo bicycle to school
everyone had stopped pretending the emergency was ever going to end.
The children who had grown up there called them "cane toads" or worse
until they banded together and made it clear that
if you shoved one of them in the hallway
you had better be prepared to face half a dozen of them the next day.

*got called names but never had anyone stand with me like that*

The psych that had screened her when she first joined up
had called it a common pattern.
"Cane toads versus hobies" had turned into "soldiers versus pirates"
and then "humans versus machines".
Her side of the equation had always been plural—had always been an "us".

*it was just me an' Aunt Naggie*

Sandrine hesitated.
She remembered being with the Fourth Augmented and before that with her school friends,
but she couldn't remember any specific people.
Or her parents—she tried and failed to imagine their faces.
She could see the kitchen of the house her family had shared with two others in Hobart,
though,
and the blue and white bamboo bicycle that Akumé had stolen and then crashed.

*Akumé din't steal your bike de stole my scarf*

Sandrine unclenched her hands again.
It was a good thing Iffy chewed her nails—she would have
dug gouges out of her palms by now otherwise.
Back to the beginning.
Hobart.
School.
The smell of the automatic disinfectant spray at the entrance
and the stern looks the guard gave anyone who tried to run through it
instead of pausing to count to five.
The awe she felt seeing a tiger pace back and forth in an enclsoure at the zoo.

*you never*

She—the tiger was a female—was a clone,
of course,
and smaller than Sandrine had expected.
She moved with loose swing of her limbs
that made something in the back of her mind want to freeze and run away
at the same time.
She had half a hectare to herself,
but spent her time patrolling the fence that separated her
from those who had created and then caged her.
She was the proudest and saddest thing Sandrine had ever seen.

*she's beautiful*

*Yes she was,*
Sandrine thought absently.
If you wanted to speak with someone without scaring them away,
you couldn't talk straight at them.
You had to say things a little to the side.

*didja ever see a giraffe?*

*No,
but I think there were still a few somewhere.*
She hesitated again.
*I don't really remember.*

*guess they din't record that 'cause they din't think you'd need it*
came back quick and clear.

*I guess not.
I wish they'd recorded my parents, though.
Or my friends from school.
It feels strange remembering about them without being able to actually remember them.*

Iffy's amusement brushed against her like a gentle, sarcastic breeze.
*you think that feels strange try tradin' places with me*

Panic hadn't worked,
so on the second day they tried nothing.
The patch Sergeant Vassilenko put on Sandrine's neck made everything fade away.
Sight, sound, the feel of her uniform against her skin,
her breathing and heartbeat—one by one they vanished
until she was suspended in nothingness.
It wasn't dark because darkness is a color.
It wasn't warm or cold or anything in between because it was *nothing*.

She tried recalling what the tiger had looked like
and the first time she had kissed someone
and a dozen other things.
None of them brought Iffy out of hiding.
She remembered someone telling her that sometimes you just had to be patient,
though she couldn't remember who had said it when or why.

She surprised herself by crying when the world came back.
"It's all right, everyone does it,"
the Marine watching over her said.
De wore a body younger and more heavily built than Sergeant Vassilenko's
and smelled faintly of soap and curry.

Sandrine sniffled and nodded.
"How long was I under?"

"Almsot an hour."
De handed Sandrine a towel and a mug of tea
and looked away as her tears started again.
An hour?
She thought it had been a day or even longer.
An hour meant there would be another session and another after that,
and even then it would only be lunchtime.

"Anything to report?"
the Marine asked,
eyes fixed on the app in der hand.

Sandrine shooked her head.
"Sorry."
She hadn't told anyone about her exchange with Iffy the night before.
At first she told herself it was because she wasn't sure it had actually happened,
but at some point during her isolation she admitted to herself that
she had't because she was afraid.
Would they still need her once they had what they wanted
or would they de-imprint her?
Or something worse?

The Marine held out der hand.
Sandrine belatedly slurped her tea and gave der back the the mug and towel.
"Round two?" de asked.

"Ready when you are," she lied,
leaning back in her chair.

She flinched slightly as de applied the patch to her neck.
*At least there aren't any straps this time,*
she thought as the world began to fade away.

*'course there are you just can't see 'em*

"Mmng?"
Sandrine grunted,
or tried to,
as the thought appeared in her head.

*my head*
Iffy's possessive was immediate and fierce.
*can't kick you out but that don't make it yours*

*I know.*
The light was gone,
and the sensation of the padded armrests under her forearms.
Sandrine took a deep breath and counted slowly.
By eleven,
she could no longer feel the stretch of her ribs—no,
of Iffy's ribs.

*For what it's worth, I'm sorry,*
she thought.
*It's just my mission.*

*yeah i bet you been sorry lotsa times but still done stuff anyway*
A second thought appeared almost on top of the first.
*bein' sorry don't make it right*

*It's my mission,*
Sandrine repeated stubbornly.

*uh uh I bet th' copy o' you that's on th' other side o' this
is sayin' 'zactly th' same thing right now*

Sandrine froze.
*What?*

*your name's kibbens right?
well there's a corporal kibbens stuck in th' head o' my friend honesty
back in halley right now
workin' for one o' th' other governors
an' i bet if de was here right now
th' two o' you would be shootin' at each other.*

Iffy's anger was like red-hot metal fresh out of a forge.
Her hurt was like an old injury reawakened—a knee sprained and half-healed
and then bent the wrong way again
to bring back familiar pain
made worse by knowing how long it would last.
*Do you love her?* Sandrine asked.

*i dunno maybe*
Iffy brushed Sandrine's thought away.
*but it ain't about that it's about someone else usin' you
like you were just a remote an' not a person*

*I'm sorry this was necessary.
I truly am.*
Sandrine put all the sincerity into the thought that she could.
*But difficult times—*

Iffy fired back something whose pronunciation had obviously changed
but whose meaning had not.
*what'd they tell you this was necessary for?
governor's losin' a war with his clones
an' figures I might be some sort o' super weapon
or maybe get th' machines t' do his fightin' for him*

Sandrine shook her head,
or thought she did.
She had no way of telling if Iffy's body was obeying her right now or not.
*That can't be right.
Every persona recording has keys and lockouts.
Only authorized personnel can—"

*this feel authorized t' you?"
Iffy snapped.
*they picked you 'cuz they know you'll do whatever someone in a uniform tells you t' do*
The contempt in the thought rolled over Sandrine
like a wave of dirty harbor water.
*here lemme show you*

Without warning Sandrine was inside
Iffy's memory of swiping through old news reports on a hand-held app
while lying on a cot somewhere underground
waiting for it to be safe to go outside.
Someone was asleep on another cot nearby,
and for some reason the memory was tinged with a musky smell
that reminded Sandrine of large farm animals.
There was a picture of her,
older by years than the "her" that had been recorded,
raising a hand as her name was called at her trial.
She was wearing civilian clothes,
or at least something that wasn't a uniform,
and her hair was pulled back in a complicated braid,
but her back was as straight as ever.

Atrocity.
Brutality.
Extenuating circumstances.
Exonerated.
The words scrolled by,
embedded in details that made her feel nauseous.
Was this really who she had become all those years ago?

*i wanted t' see what was gonna happen t' honesty*
Iffy's thought was quiet and tinged with sadness.
*jeep ain't been right since his time
cuz o' what got mixed into him
an' i wanted t' know what you might be leavin' behind*

*That's not me.*
Sandrine didn't know which of them she was trying to convince.
*That's not who I was when I was recorded
so that's not who I am right now.
I wouldn't—*
She stopped.
She wouldn't do those things,
but clearly she would.
All of a sudden she was tired.
She wished she could just lie down and close her eyes
and let sleep take her away.

*can if you want*

*But I can't,*
Sandrine replied wearily.
*I have a mission.*
And then she took everything she had learned about Iffy
and turned it into a missile in her mind
and fired.

An hour later
Sandrine stood at attention in the governor's windowless office.
"Yes sir, I believe so,"
she said,
eyes fixed on a tiny spot on the wall above his head.

"Mm."
He steepled his hands under his chin.
"That's quite a bit faster than our models predicted."

"Thank you, sir."
One two three four thumb,
one four two three thumb—she forced the hands clasped behind her back
to be still.

"Mm,"
the governor repeated skeptically.
"We will of course have to do some tests to be sure."

"Of course, sir."
She lowered her gaze to meet his eyes.
"May I suggest cardboard, sir?
And perhaps some string?
Sergeant Vassilenko can do whatever cutting is needed
if you don't think it's safe for me to have scissors."

"Yes,
well,
unfortunately the sergeant isn't available right now.
Another thing our models failed to predict,"
he added sourly.
Light sparkled briefly in his eyes.
"But no matter.
Cardboard and string sounds perfect for a first outing,
and I'm sure we can trust you with scissors
as long as you promise not to run with them."

"Sir?"
Sandrine asked after a moment.

Governor Stern waved a hand.
"An old joke.
Here."
He pulled a flimsy of freshly-printed paper out of a slot in his desk
and handed it to her.
"Start with that and see what else you can do.
Surprise me, if you can."

She saluted as she heard the door open behind her.
"Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir."

Her Marine escort—one beside, one behind—said nothing
as they marched her to an office on the floor below
that appeared identical to the governor's
except for the small mound of hastily-collected craft supplies on the desk.
One of the Marines handed her a pair of blunt-ended scissors
as solemnly as de would have handed her a loaded gauss gun.
She heard the lock in the door click as she sat down
and studied the flimsy in her hand.

Sandrine lost track of time as she measured, cut, shaped, and tied.
They had only given her six rubber bands:
she stretched each one to its limit
before deciding to tie them together as they were
rather than trying to splice them.
The cardboard wasn't as rigid as she would have liked,
but some origami folds took care of that
and there were two different weights of aluminum foil to stiffen the result with.

Her sudden yawn surprised her.
How long had she been sitting there?
The noise her spine made when she twisted from side to side
suggested it had been hours—real hours,
not the stretched out un-time she had gone through that morning.
She looked down at what she had made.
It was a far cry from what the governor had asked her to build,
but that was the point.
She just wished they had given her some paint so that she could finish it off properly.

"All right,"
she said under her breath,
standing to stretch once more
before knocking briskly on the door.
She picked up her creation as it opened
and marched out without a backward glance,
wondering as she left whether this was how her older self had felt
leaving the courtroom
all those years ago.

The governor turned what she had built over in his hands.
"It seems simpler than I expected,"
he said cautiously.

Sandrine shrugged.
"Simple is good.
Here, let me show you."
She took it from him and cranked its cardboard tail around and around,
counting to fifty in her head,
then set it down.
With one slow, swinging step after another,
the cardboard giraffe began striding toward the edge of the desk,
its head bobbing in counterpoint each time a leg swung forward.

"Well done.
I think that's all the proof—"

"Excuse me, sir."
Sandrine raised a finger.
"If you'll just give it a moment please?"

The governor sat back and steepled his fingers under his chin.
*I really wish he'd stop doing that,*
Sandrine thought.
Five steps, ten—when it reached the edge of the desk
the giraffe put one foot into empty air and stopped.
Its head continued bobbing up and down,
but its legs no longer propelled it forward.

"I say,"
the governor said admiringly.
"That's quite the trick."

"I figured out a way to make a Hoye latch out of tinfoil, sir.
It only has one, though.
If I started it further ahead or behind and its left leg went over first,
it wouldn't have worked."

The governor smiled as if at a clever quip.
"So, a nice bit of engineering and a bit of the old razzle dazzle, eh?"
He wiggled his fingers in the air.

"Yes, sir."

"Well."
He picked up the giraffe,
turned it over,
and held it out to her once again.
"For good luck,"
he explained when she hesitated.
"I'm afraid your next assignment is going to be a little more complicated.
And a bit riskier.
Private… um…?"

"Leung, sir,"
the Marine behind her said.

"Private Leung will escort you downstairs.
We've set up an isolation area with the usual precautions.
Please do check with him before making any modifications—we really would like to avoid
any misunderstandings."

"Of course, sir."
She tapped her fingers on the giraffe's cardboard body,
one two three four thumb,
one four two three thumb.
"May I ask what I'll be making, sir?"

"Oh yes, of course.
Silly of me to forget."
*Which you didn't,*
Sandrine thought.
*You just wanted me to ask.*

The governor swiped an image of a four-legged sentry bot onto the wall.
"We've been trying to get into the main chamber
of whatever the Niobium project was a cover for.
It has proven to be quite stubborn—whenever we get past its outer defenses
it starts warning us about thermonuclear this and quantum implosion that.
Our models tell us that subterfuge might work better.
Sneaking in,"
he explained as she opened her mouth.
"We recovered one of these bots along with Citizen Kwan.
If you can put some sensors in it that the base can't detect,
well,
that would certainly be a step in the right direction."

"Of course, sir, I'll do my best."
She hesitated.
"May I ask please, is there a timeline?"

The governor cocked an eyebrow.
"What do you mean?"

"Is there a deadline of any sort, sir?"
It was as close as Sandrine dared come to asking
if they had to beat the other governors
that she probably wasn't supposed to know about.

"Well,
sooner is always better,"
the governor said briskly.
Light sparkled in his eyes.
"Now if you'll forgive me,
I really must take this call.
Good luck."

"Thank you, sir."
He waved a hand in her direction as she saluted and left,
his attention already elsewhere.

The "isolation area" turned out to be the middle of
what Sandrine guessed had until yesterday been a cafeteria.
Six tables pushed together were her workbench.
Together,
they were the center square in a tic-tac-toe grid.
The other eight squares were empty except for
the cameras, fire extinguishers, EMPs, and needle guns bolted to the walls.
She knew they were there in case whatever she built got out of hand,
but they still made the space between her shoulderblades itch
the way it sometimes did—or had—when she was in the field.

The sentry bot was laid out in pieces across three of the tables.
One leg was missing,
but that would be easy to replace.
Its core,
on the other hand—she held it up in front of a circular UV light.
The tiny imperfections that allowed this piece of crystal to think
sparkled like the tech in the governor's eyes.
She carefully put it back in its gold-lined neutralite case and set it aside.
Mechanicals first,
then she could worry about the safeties and failsafes that were sure to be hidden in its programming.

Private Leung sat on a stool by the door
and watched her work
with the patience of someone who had been on watch just as often as she had.
"Sorry,"
he said when she asked if he could help her turn over the bot's torso.
"Orders are to keep my distance, just in case."
He patted the gauss gun in his lap.

"No worries."
In truth the bot was lighter than it looked,
in part thanks to the absence of ammunition.
Asking the private to help had mostly been the equivalent of
sending a drone over unknown territory
to see what she was up against.

He did pass on her request for a ladder,
a pulley,
and some cable,
though.
"Oh g'day," Sandrine said as the door opened
and Sergeant Vassilenko carried them in.

The sergeant didn't even glance at her as he set down his load.
"Don't mind him,"
Private Leung said after he left.
"Just got a refresh last night.
He'll be back to normal in a day or two."

"Refresh?"
Sandrine asked as casually as she could
as she opened the ladder's legs
and positioned it beside the bot's torso.

"Yeah."
Leung shrugged.
"We're not lasting as long as we used to.
Apparently we start to go wonky after a couple or three weeks now.
The sergeant started talking about Bharati again
so they had to do another imprint."

Sandrine froze for a moment with the pulley in her hands
before climbing the ladder.
Private Leung gave no sign of having noticed.
"What's a Bharati?" she asked as she began looping wire around the rafter.

The soldier shrugged his host's shoulders again.
"Some place further up the coast.
Some op went skew there twenty years ago.
Apparently our suits are all off-book orphans from that."
He pointed a thumb at his chest to make it clear what he meant by "suits".

"Not this one,"
Sandrine grunted
as she lifted the pulley into place.
The wires tightened but held when she put weight on the pulley,
so she threaded the cable around the wheel and climbed back down.
One end of the cable crimped into a carabiner
that clipped onto the bot's back.
She hauled on the other to lift its weight,
then stooped and duck-walked under the table.

"Hey!"
Private Leung stood up and levelled the gauss gun in her direction.
"Come out of there!"

"Give me a second,"
she called.
"I just have to—mmph—I just have to tie this off."

"I said come out,"
he barked.
"Now!"

"All right, all right, don't get your frontal lobes in a twist."
She stood and raised her hands.
"See?"
The bot swayed gently from side to side beside her.
"Now I can get the legs back on."

She didn't do that right away, though.
If everything went according to plan it would be the last step but one.
Humming quietly under her breath,
she measured and cut a section of honeycomb steel,
mounted it on a slow lathe,
and carefully wrapped it with copper wire.
"Crap,"
she muttered as she tested its inductance with a hand-held meter.
Her instincts were good,
but this wasn't her body—her hands had wound the wire just a little too loosely.

Her second attempt was good enough,
and the three after that were even better.
"Can I get something to eat?" she asked Private Leung.
He nodded and spoke into his collar
as she swept bits of scrap into a box
and started dismantling the laser sight on the bot's gun.
The laser went into a clamp that spun and tilted at her command.
The gnat-sized camera that accompanied it went into another, smaller clamp
that began jerking from one position to another,
seemingly at random,
as she sucked the first welcome mouthful of mango-flavored protein slurry
from the bottle Private Leung handed her.
If anyone had asked
she would have told them that she was recalibrating the camera,
but no one asked
and she knew enough not to volunteer the information.
Innocent people didn't feel like they needed to tell stories,
so she wasn't going to tell hers.

Building a fourth leg for the bot was easier and harder than she expected:
easier because someone had already printed most of the parts she needed,
but harder because they fit together in ways that only made sense to other machines.
Eccentric gears whose teeth only fit together in exactly one way
had to be connected to cables twisted a precise number of times
to maximize the tensile recoil of mechanical ankles and knees.
The tiny auxiliary motors in the thigh each had four different kinds of ratchet,
but each of those ratchets had to be tilted at a particular angle
to distribute their weight correctly.

Her humming turned to muttering and then curses as she assembled the parts.
By the time the leg was finished there was nothing left of her lunch
except a scum of chalky sludge in the bottom of the bottle.
"Can I get another of these?" she asked,
starting a count in her head.

The last one had taken two minutes—she hoped that would be enough time.
The camera she had taken from the bot's gunsight
had managed to find four tiny lenses:
two in the walls,
one in the ceiling,
and one in the door itself.
Their coordinates were buried in the schematic of the bot's torso
that she had redrawn a dozen times throughout the morning.
Four targets plus one,
and she hoped Private Leung would forgive her.

One two three four thumb.
One four two three thumb.
She heard footsteps in the corridor.
"Take a deep breath and find the center of the storm,"
a long-ago voice said in her head.
It was now or never.

She reached up and cut the cable.
The sentry bot dropped to the floor with a thud.
"What—" Private Leung started to say,
and then he shouted and clutched his face
as the laser sight pivoted and fired at his eyes.
The meds would be able to repair the damage—at least Sandrine hoped they would—but
for the next few minutes at least he was out of action.

The laser pivoted again,
firing and firing to blind the hidden cameras
as the door opened.
The Marine bringing her second lunch shouted
as the sentry bot leaped at him,
knocking him back and blocking the door from closing.
Sandrine slung the half-dozen little EMPs she had made over her shoulder and ran.

*right go right go right*
Iffy said in her head.
*up there on the wall the recharge slot for the cleaning bot plug it in there*

Sandrine dropped to one knee and fumbled the first EMP into place.
She felt it shiver
when she stuck the two bare copper ends of the coil she had made
into the outlet in the wall.
All around her the lights went out
and the alarm that had been blaring fell silent.

*aright one down five to go but you gotta move faster*

*Yeah, well, maybe you should've gotten more exercise,*
Sandrine shot back.
She whistled as she struggled back to her feet.
"Front," she ordered the bot as it trotted up beside her.
She smiled,
though it would be more accurate to say she bared her teeth,
and charged.

*twelve hours earlier…*

*"Can if you want," Iffy thought.

*"But I can't",
Sandrine replied wearily.
"I have a mission."
And then she took everything she had learned about her host
and turned it into a missile in her mind
and fired.*

*Iffy absorbed it without missing a beat.
"You stopped havin' missions a long time ago.
Look."
And once again Sandrine was inside Iffy's memory,
scrolling through old news stories
until she reached an obituary.
Corporal Sandrine Kibbens,
formerly of the Fourth Augmented Infantry,
had died for the last and final time in the Dobson Valley.
Heavy storms…
an earthquake…
a mudslide that had swallowed a hundred homes…
The military government had declared that
they couldn't spare resources for a rescue mission.
Sandrine had stolen a hovertruck and gone to save people anyway.
Thirty-eight people owed her their lives,
and if it hadn't been for a second mudslide the number would have been higher.*

*"Folks that had a right t' give you missions are long gone,"
Iffy thought at her.
"You're just a useful piece o' salvage t' th' governor an' his others,
but you still got a choice.
You can decide which one o' her you want t' be."*

*There was a moment neither of them shared with the other.
"I wish I could remember my mum and dad," Sandrine finally thought.*

*"I know," Iffy replied gently.
"All I got o' mine is how they ended.
I wouldn't give that up,
but I'd give just about anythin' else t' have more."*

*Another moment passed.
"All right," Sandrine thought.
"What's your plan?"*

## Chapter 13

They only had to deploy four of their home-made EMPs,
but that was enough to get them to the top floor.
They used the fifth to knock someone off-balance long enough
for the sentry bot to knock der out of the way.
When they rounded a corner and ran headlong into a couple of Marines
they shouted, "Grenade!" and pitched the last one underhand,
then fled in the opposite direction
as the pair ducked into a nearby doorway for shelter.

Sergeant Vassilenko,
or whoever was in the body he'd been wearing when they first met him,
was on guard by the exit.
His mouth worked as he tried to yell at her to stop,
but his imprint still hadn't fully taken hold.

*Let me do this,* Sandrine thought.
He was bigger than they were,
but his punches and kicks were jerky and uncoordinated.
Hers were not:
she blocked,
blocked again,
punched hard,
and then swept his feet out from under him.

The exit was locked.
The hinges were on the inside
and big enough for the sentry bot to grasp.
Outside was colder than they expected and shadowed instead of sunshine-bright.

They shielded their eyes with the palm of their hand.
"What the hell?" Sandrine said.
The buildings around them were burned-out shells.
Soot and scorch marks had been faded by time,
but that just made them even uglier.

*It's Bharati,* Iffy thought.
*There was a fire here.
Whole bunch o' people died.*

"Not all of them,"
Sandrine muttered,
thinking about what Private Leung had said about Sergeant Vassilenko.
Both of their bodies were the right age to have been children twenty years ago.
"How much time do we have?"

*Couple more minutes 'til everythin's back online.
We gotta go that way.*
Their arm jerked to point.
With the sentry bot loping along at her heels,
they set off at a run.

She had never been to Bharati before,
or if she had,
it had been a different copy of her,
but it was immediately familiar.
The long cindered arc across the front of that building—that
was a Gatling laser tracking a fast-moving target.
The shattered remains of a concrete wall spread across the road a block later
had the half-melted edges left by a high-temperature blast.
She had used weapons like that herself against both people and machines.
The rectangular tread marks spaced at half-meter intervals under her running feet
had been left by something heavy.
The crater where they ended told her what its fate had been.

*They'll have exos an' drones back online any second.*
Iffy thought.

Sandrine nodded.
*That still feels weird,* Iffy thought.

"Sorry," Sandrine puffed.
She ducked into what might once have been a neighborhood temple and crouched down.
The sentry bot came to a stop beside her.
"Your turn."

If someone had asked,
Sandrine would have said that she stepped back and let Iffy take over.
It wasn't like that, though.
It was more like fading away a little so that Iffy could become more real.
As their hands opened the side of the sentry bot and made a few adjustments,
she wondered if this was what it would be like as her imprint subsided.
Would she feel more and more transparent until there was no trace of her left?
How many times had copies of her gone through that?

"I don't think it's like that most o' the time."
It was Iffy's turn to speak aloud.
She sounded distracted to Sandrine,
which might have had something to do with the red warning label
on the power supply in the sentry bot's torso
that she was tweaking with a screwdriver,
a shim of metal bent on itself to make tweezers,
and enough muttered curses to supply an entire brigade of Marines.

"Jeep an' others,
it's like bits o' them got put in storage an' replaced with bits o' you for a while.
I figure th' two of us bein' like this is down to whatever's in me
that th' governor's so excited t' get his hands on."
She reattached the last of the wires she had pulled free
and took a deep breath.
"Wasn't sure that would work," she confessed.
"I mean,
not blow us up."

*It's your body if you do,* Sandrine thought,
and then,
*I'm sorry.
That they did this to you, I mean.
They shouldn't have.*

"Weren't your fault," Iffy grunted,
straightening up.
"An' t' tell you th' truth,
I'm glad I got t' meet you.
I figure if you're who's in Honesty's head,
she'll be aright.
Now,
let's go blow stuff up."

She patted the sentry bot's back and pointed back the way they had come.
"Go."
As the bot loped away she said,
"Aright, your watch."

*Thanks.*
Sandrine rolled her/their/Iffy's head from side to side
and started running.
They didn't have much time,
and that hovercraft wasn't going to steal itself.

The scientists and engineers who erected the first building at Bharati Station
played a single game of cricket in the snow
so that they could send pictures of it back to their families.
As the temperature and other buildings both went up in the years and decades that followed,
those games became a regular fixture of station life.
And when people began bringing their families with them
to escape the droughts, floods, and communal warfare of their homeland,
the proposal to build a proper cricket pitch
went from a standing joke to a unanimously-approved item in the town plan.

Sandrine doubted the stadium's architects had realized that
such a large, covered space would be a perfect place to hide an oversized hovercraft
from passing satellites.
She was more concerned with how sketchy Iffy's plan for pirating it was.
She had heard,
"We'll figure it out when we get there,"
before several missions when she was herself.
None of them had gone well,
but it was too late for second thoughts now.

*Boom!*
They felt the explosion as much as they heard it.
Somewhere behind them,
the sentry bot's power cells had reached their limit and then some.
She doubted it would slow their pursuers down by much,
but every second counted.

There were no guards at the stadium.
Why would there be?
They were hundreds of kilometers from the nearest settlement,
and anyone capable of crossing that expanse
would not have been slowed down by a couple of shivering Marines.

*What if they haven't fixed the coolant pumps?*
Sandrine thought
as Iffy took control of her/their body
and slithered underneath the hovercraft's armored ground-effect skirt.

"Then we better hope th' governor has a sense o' humor,"
Iffy grunted.
With a screwdriver in one hand and something that looked like
a cross between a ratchet wrench and a tuning fork in the other,
she set to work.

Moments later a panel barely wider than her/their shoulders clanged open.
*That's for maintenance drones, isn't it?*

"Yup,"
Iffy said aloud as she tucked her tools back into her/their pockets.
"Hope you don't mind a squeeze."

The duct was just wide enough to wriggle through.
They were stuck at a corner for one terrifying moment,
and in another spot they had to slide forward,
roll over,
stuff their legs into a side duct,
and roll over again in order to be able to move forward.
There was no light,
of course,
and everything smelled of metal and machine oil.
Sandrine did her best to fade into the background
so that Iffy could find them a path through the schematic in her head.

*Aright,* Iffy finally thought.
*You ready?*

*Yes sir.*
One two three four thumb,
one four two three thumb.
Yes, she was ready.

*I ain't no 'sir',*
Iffy fired back.

Sandrine grinned in the darkness.
"I think you would have made a fine officer.
Here we go."
She kicked out the grill at her/their feet
and dropped into the hovercraft's auxiliary engineering station.

The station was bigger than the duct they had just been crawling through,
but not by much.
Apps were securely bolted onto three walls,
and a harness hung on the door behind them.
There was a helmet too,
in case the ride got so bumpy that concussion might be an issue.
Iffy buckled herself in and closed her eyes.

Schematics appeared,
red and blue and sizzling-bright white,
each surrounded by a swirling flock of information.
She grinned at Sandrine's double-take.
*Still feels that way m'self,* she thought as she dove in.
There and there and there—outer hatches locked as engines rumbled to life.
Two people were in the cockpit and a third was already on der way to her station
with a handgun and—an ax?
Really?
Why would anyone have an ax on board a hovercraft?

It didn't matter.
No one had thought to grab a breathing mask,
so she told the hovercraft's core that every single corridor was engulfed in flames.
Choking and swearing,
the tech who had been headed her way retreated into a cabin
whose door locked a moment before de realized der mistake.

The two in the cockpit were going to be more of a problem.
There were manual overrides in case anyone did
exactly what she was now doing,
but she would worry about them later.
A dozen tiled views in the app on her left told her that the Marines had arrived.
Unlike the tech who was now trying to break through the door to der cabin,
they had thought ahead:
two were carrying heavy cylinders
that both she and the app's overlays identified as rocket launchers.

The hovercraft lifted and slid sideways as its turbines came to life.
"Here we go!" Iffy shouted.
The acceleration threw her forward against her harness straps
and sent a sharp stab through her abdomen.
Marines threw themselves out of the hovercraft's way
as it lurched backward out of the stadium,
knocked a bit of concrete off a pillar that had clearly seen worse,
spun,
and roared out of town.

*Drones at four o'clock,* Sandrine thought.

"What?" Iffy glanced at the clock in the corner of the app.
"It's only—"

*Back and right.*
Sandrine nudged Iffy's eyes to a tile showing the sky behind them.

"Yeah, well, good luck to 'em,"
Iffy said distractedly.
Image after image flashed across the app in front of her.
There—that one.
She fired a rapid stream of instructions at the hovercraft
and unbuckled her harness.

And promptly collapsed.
*We're bleeding,* Sandrine thought calmly.
*And our blood pressure—wait, no, don't try to stand up.*

"Gotta…"
Iffy struggled and then slumped back onto the deck.
She felt nauseous and so, so tired
and there was something wet on her face,
something dripping.

*Nosebleed,* Sandrine confirmed.
*And if our heart beats any faster we're probably going to pass out.
Let me take over.*

Iffy shook her head.
"Ow," she whimpered.

*Let me do this,* Sandrine urged.
Without waiting for an answer she poured herself into Iffy's arms and legs
and grabbed hold of the harness
to haul herself/themself onto her/their feet.
No,
her feet,
she was the one standing.
She had walked home from school one day with a fever
as yet another mutant flu swept across the world.
The teacher had passed out at his desk,
wheezing with each sweaty breath.
She remembered one of her classmates saying they should stay
and wait for someone to tell them what to do,
but somehow she had known that no one was coming.

Open the door.
Steady yourself on the frame.
Come on, soldier, you have a mission.
Left foot, right foot, left right left.
Open the door.
No,
don't bother to close it behind you.
There is no "behind".
There's only forward to the next door,
the one that matters.
Open it.
Fall into the waiting chair.
Straps—I know, I know,
your hands feel like a bunch of bananas
(*You had bananas?*)
but you have to do up the straps.
Button—there's a button you need to push.
Which button?
That one's big and red and right there.
You missed.
Come *on* soldier, you can do this.
Try again.
Make a fist.
Up and…down.

Weight on her chest pressed her into the chair.
There was sunlight all around her.
Her last thought before slipped away into nothingness was,
"Good luck, kid—say hi the next time you see me."

Iffy felt an upside-down ache in her chest when she finally regained consciousness
and knew immediately that Sandrine was gone.
"Thank you," she whispered.
She wiped tears, snot, and blood off her face and looked dully out the escape pod's windows
at the tundra racing by.

It wasn't technically an escape pod—the hovercraft's schematics labeled it
a PN-420 single-seat rapid reconnaissance vehicle—but
that's what Sandrine had called it when Iffy pulled it up in her head.
"Figures,"
the Marine had said.
"Someone like the governor is always going to have a back door in case they need it."
And then she had whistled.
"Looks like a nice ride, too."

And it was,
though it was noisier than Iffy had expected.
Two fuel cells,
a motor,
a ground-effect skirt made of blast-resistant material,
a well-cushioned seat beneath a curved plastic window,
three independent communication systems in place of the weapons it would usually carry,
and a double helping of rations and first-aid supplies
made it feel like something out of a sim.
All she needed was a mask, a cape, a catchy name,
and a loyal combat bot as a butler slash love interest
and she'd be ready to save the world.

The first step,
apparently,
was to clean her face.
Nobody ever had to do that in a sim,
Iffy thought as she fumbled in the medical kit for something absorbent.
People got shot,
people bled,
but no one ever got *messy*.

She brought up a map on the navigation app in front of her.
A blue dot in the center was her location.
Elevation lines and a dusty sparkling overlay showed
the foothills ahead
and the clouds above her.
She thought briefly about connecting to the drones circling Bharati
to check for pursuit,
but no.
The governor would have made the pod as close to unfindable as he could.
Even the gentlest ping would give its location away.

"Shad."
She shook her head.
Of *course* the pod didn't have a toilet.
She tossed the bloodied wipe into the recycler,
closed her eyes,
and let her head fall forward again.

The next time she woke
she was almost three hundred kilometers closer to Halley.
The map showed an unfinished road bed up ahead.
*Too obvious,* she imagined Sandrine saying in her head,
so she drew a line on the app with her finger
to steer the pod toward the coast.
It wouldn't be stable on ocean waves,
but a beach or calm inshore water would be doable,
and all of a sudden she missed the ocean.

*«status interrogative update compliance»*

"Shut up," she muttered.
"I'm doin' my best.
An' anyway,
where were you when I needed you?"

A floor plan of the governor's hidden base in Bharati appeared behind her eyes.
Symbols skittered this way and that
leaving phosphorescent lines of probability in their wake.
A clogged drain meant this Marine was too far away to intervene
when Iffy made her escape.
Imprinting glitches made two others too shaky to help with the pursuit,
and—

"Aright, aright, thank you."
Iffy shook her head.
"Could'na done it without you,
an' if you can keep up th' good work
I'll try t' figure out what th' hell I'm gonna do next."

Half-way between Bharati and Halley
the escape pod startled a small herd of shaggy brown caribou.
The map zoomed in automatically to show
the red dots that appeared without warning
as the animals scrambled to their feet and gallopped away on long, ungainly legs.
"Disable targeting," Iffy snapped
as ranges and elevations blossomed on the app.
They couldn't hurt her.

The caribou made her think about Iñacio,
and thinking about Iñacio made her feel sad.
She and Sandrine had tried to come up with a two-person escape plan,
but without knowing where he was…

The comm system chose that moment to bleeble.
"Wide-channel transmission accept Y/N" appeared on the app.
Feeling reckless,
Iffy swiped to accept.

"Citizens of Antarctica,"
the governor's voice said warmly over a montage of images
from Halley and Rothera and other, smaller settlements.
"I know the recent turmoil has been difficult for all of us,
but thanks to the assistance provided by our friends from the Federated Republics,
I am pleased to say that order has now been restored in most districts.
I deeply regret the loss of life and property,
and I promise there will be a full inquiry as soon as conditions permit."

His voice hardened as "92% confidence" scrolled across the bottom of the app.
"Unfortunately,
our troubles are not yet completely behind us.
While the former governor of Halley chose to turn himself in
to order to avoid further strife,
the former governor of Paddington South is still at large.
We believe he is now working with a machine collaborator named Fifth Ang Kwan."
The pictures of cobbled streets vanished
and were replaced by stills and videos of Iffy.

"This person is extremely dangerous,"
the governor went on,
oblivious to the shock and outrage on Iffy's face.
"She has been implicated in several acts of sabotage,
and may be able to control or subvert any sentient machinery in her vicinity."
The video of French Henry twitching and shaking on damp gray cobblestones
appeared in an inset on one side of the app.
In another,
a scanner bot knocked one Marine off der feet while a sentry bot tangled itself
in another Marine's exoskelton.

"If you see her,
do not approach her yourself!
For your own safety and the safety of others,
please contact the authorities.
We will do everything in our power to apprehend her without further loss of life."

He went on a little longer about standing together
and how the brave spirit that all Antarticans shared
could never be extinguished,
but Iffy was too angry to pay attention.
Too angry and then suddenly afraid as well.
What had they done to Aunt Naggie?

*Do y' know where she is?* she thought desperately,
but the machines didn't reply,
not even when she added *please*.

The escape pod's engines thrummed a deeper note for a few minutes
as it raced along a stream.
Iffy wiped her face on her sleeve.
The pod had two little drones,
each the size of her fist.
She could afford to use one to get a message out
without giving away her position.
The thought of what she had to say left an ugly taste in her mouth,
but all her choices were behind her now.

"Record for playback," she ordered the pod's app,
then said what she needed to say.

The sign outside Buhr called it "the best little town south of 60".
Someone had added, "Population: 0" decades ago
when the mine closed down
and the handful of people still hanging on
were relocated to other settlements.
Iffy knew she couldn't stop there—by  now,
anything marked on the map would be under surveillance—but
it was the closest spot to her with a name.

She did her best to park the escape pod in the shadows beneath a small cliff,
wincing when its side scraped against stone.
"Camouflage full," she told its little core,
then lifted the plastic windshield on its hydraulic hinges and clambered out
as the pod did its best to make itself invisible.

The ground was sandy and slightly damp.
A few tufts of grass had managed to colonize it,
but they already turned brown and stiff.
Winter was coming.
She shivered and wished she dared to light a fire.
She felt more alone on the tundra than she ever had at sea,
and she missed Sandrine.

*«delivery confirmed»*

"Thanks," she said aloud.
Machine thoughts appearing in her mind wasn't the same as having someone to talk to,
but to her surprise it actually felt better than nothing.

An hour went by.
She saw two birds in the distance,
though they might just have been spotter drones searching for her,
and something the size of an arctic hare
scurried from one tuft of grass to another at one point.
When the pod's app finally pinged she stood up,
tossed another piece of gravel at the blotch on the cliff
she had decided was the governor's face,
and wriggled back into her seat.

A single word waited for her: "agreed".
The trace attached to it showed that
those six letters had been scrambled using the key she had sent in her message
and scattered across fifteen different airborne and orbital relays
in order to reach her.
It wasn't a guarantee,
but as Uncle Jack reminded people,
there weren't any in this life and even fewer in the next.

She checked the time.
She had six hours.
She wasn't interested in any of the pod's sims,
she didn't have any tools,
and she had satisfied her craving for a toilet an hour ago,
so she closed her eyes and let herself float away from her exhausted body.

*She was on deck.
The sky was a perfect blue,
and her olders were stuffing her into her ecosuit.
"Just in case, love," Second said, forcing a smile.*

*"No," Iffy said fiercely, wriggling free.
"I can help!"*

*"It's too late," Second said sadly.
"It's always been too late, love."*

*Iñacio nodded and patted the six-legged bot bumping its camera array against his knee.
"You can't fix the world, Iffy.
Nobody can."*

*"We can try!" she said fiercely.
"Th' governor an' th' machines an', an' everybody,
they wouldn't be chasin' me like this if they din't think there was a chance
I could do somethin'.
An' even if I can't—"*

She knew she was dreaming,
but even in her dreams she'd never dared to say this before.
*Even if I can't, I gotta make it mean somethin'.
Livin' when you didn't an' all th' shad Aunt Naggie's put up with
an' what happened to Jeep an' Honesty an', an' Sandrine—if I don't try,
none of it mattered.
Now shut up an' let me sleep.*

The pod woke her five hours later.
She yawned and stretched as well as she could in her chair,
wrinkling her nose at her own muggy smell.
The next time she risked her life to save the world,
or whatever,
she was going to make sure showers were available.
Real showers,
not just the stinging mist she had grown up with on the *Guinevere*.
And toilets and fresh vegetables and a galley and a machine shop
and big, firm slaps of foam to sleep on instead of cots and padded chairs.

A swipe and a couple of taps brought up a map of her surroundings.
The train from Rothera to Zhongshan would pass through Buhr in fifty-eight minutes.
It would slow down briefly just east of her
where the track bent in a long arc around the old mining pit.
There would be drones overhead:
even if nobody was looking for her,
scavs and jackers were a constant low-level headache for long-haul freight.
Her pod's dazzle wouldn't be able to hide it
if it tried to match speed with the train,
so it was a good thing it wouldn't have to.
She swallowed the last mouthful of a sugary high-protein ration bar,
thought wistfully again about the *Guinevere*'s galley
and Aunt Naggie's noodles,
and told the pod to start its engines.

*As the hovercraft lifted, pivoted, and began to accelerate,
something the size and shape of an arctic
raised its head cautiously from its hiding place behind a tuft of grass.
Sunlight glinted off its head
where an old scrape had torn false fur away from its metal skull.
One glass eye tracked the visitor's departure,
and then it disappeared back into its hole to wait for its next mission.
If its little core had been sophisticated enough for emotion
it might have felt a sense of satisfaction for having done its duty.
The fact that nothing had been listening to its broadcasts for decades
would have been irrelevant.*

The pod would have steered a course parallel to the train track.
A half-memory of a sim she had once played prompted Iffy
to make it randomize their path instead.
She didn't think it would actually make a difference,
but it took her mind off things for a few moments.
She was more nervous than she had been escaping from Bharati.
Some of it was not having Sandrine there to talk to,
but what if—

*Uh uh.*
She shoved her worries into a mental locker as firmly as she could.
A thousand things could go wrong and at least a couple probably would.
There was nothing she could do about any of them right now.

Ten minutes.
There were lots of places to hide in the grass-grown wasteland
of the old mining pit,
but that was too obvious to be safe.
The train's drones would have recorded every tuft and pebble
each time they passed by.
Even the slightest change would be flagged and investigated.

The same was true of Buhr itself,
but the little stream that ran alongside the tracks was another matter.
The soil around it was loose enough to make minor slumps and potholes a regular occurrence.
With luck,
those frequent changes would convince whoever or whatever might be watching
that her camouflaged pod was just another bit of entropy.
She set down next to a particularly unstable-looking arc of sand and started a countdown.

Two minutes.
The pod's vibration sensor painted a green trace on the map
that solidified as the core became more certain of its epicenter.
Sixty seconds.
If she climbed out of the pod and stood on top of it
she would be able to see a dot on the horizon.
She stayed put.
One two three four thumb,
one four two three thumb.
She grinned as she caught herself tapping
the rhythm Sandrine used to calm herself.

Thirty seconds.
The pod's speakers relayed the quiet shush of the approaching train.
Twenty.
Ten,
and suddenly it was loud enough to drown out conversation,
just for a count of five,
and then the train had passed
leaving just a final dwindling shush in its wake.

Aright.
If this was a sim it would be the perfect time for the main character to deliver
a punchy catchphrase.
Too bad it was her real life.
She slid back the plastic windshield and climbed out of the pod
with a blocky remote in one hand
and a bottle of water in the other.

Three hundred and eighty kilometers an hour was just over a hundred meters per second,
which meant that even with precise timing
the person she was looking for
could be a kilometer in either direction.
This stretch of tundra was flat enough that she could see much further than that,
so the real problem would be how camouflaged he was.

"Hi."
Iffy jumped and whirled around at the voice behind her
just in time to see Johnson Wales straighten up and brush dirt off his hands.

"Sorry,"
he said.
"I didn't mean to startle you."

"Yes you affin' did,"
Iffy snapped.
"No, wait, stay right there."
She raised her her remote and bottle.
"Come any closer an' I'll dose us both."

Wales frowned.
The tech in his temples sparkled for a moment.
"That's just water."

Iffy grinned savagely.
"Thank you—I worked hard on that.
Now show me what you brought."

"I think we should—" Wales began.

"Lemme see you right affin' now or we're both goin' t' sleep!"
She shook her bottle menacingly.

"All right."
The air beside him flickered and solidified to reveal a familiar toolbox.

"Open it up."
Wales nodded,
undid the catches,
and flipped back the lid
to reveal tools and parts packed so tightly together
that it was hard to see where each one ended and the next began.

"Aright."
Iffy jerked her chin to point.
"Town's that way.
Pretty sure they'll spot you long b'fore you get there,
but it's still a ways.
You best get movin'."

"I'm not going anywhere until we've had a chance to talk,"
Wales said calmly,
tucking his hands into his parka's pockets.

"Keep 'em out where I can see 'em!" Iffy snapped.
"An' I don't think you got much t' say that I wanna hear,
so how about you save yer breath an' my time both?"

Wales sighed.
"For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
I am,"
he continued as Iffy opened her mouth.
"I did what I thought was right at the time.
I'd probably do the same thing again in the same situation,
but the situation has changed."
He spread his hands.
"We can still save the world if you want to."

Iffy shook her bottle menacingly again.
"You must think I'm six diff'rent kinds o' stupid," she spat.
"Trusted you th' one time, not gonna trust you again."

"I did what I thought was right,"
Wales repeated.
"I thought the governor would get us to the lab and let us do what we need to.
I was wrong.
I'm sorry."
For a moment the weight of his years came through in his voice.
"I'm sorry for a lot of things."

"Not much use cryin' now."
The wind ran its fingers across the fuzz on Iffy's scalp.

Wales shrugged.
"No.
But if you really were going to blow me up or poison me
or whatever it is you're pretending that bottle's for,
you wouldn't have asked for my help."
He put his hands back in his pockets and looked at her
until she lowered her bottle and remote.

"Aright.
But before we go anywhere you're gonna tell me what that lab's really about
an' why everyone's so in'rested in me."

The corner of Wales mouth quirked up.
"Your First said almost exactly the same thing to me when I first met her,
except she had an actual gun pointed at my head.
So, once upon a time…"

"Oh no you don't.
No fairy tales."

"It's my story,
I'll tell it the way I want to."
He closed the lid of his toolbox and sat down on it,
patting a spot beside him.
Iffy just glared at him.

Wales shrugged and leaned forward to put his elbows on his knees.
"Once upon a time the world was falling apart.
Where there wasn't flood there was drought,
and both brought hunger and disease.
Forests were burning,
the oceans were rising,
species were disappearing every day,
and no matter what people did,
their models kept making the same dark predictions."

"The people responsible suffered less than most,
of course,
but they still suffered.
Some lost themselves in sims.
Others built walls to protect their little kingdoms,
and others still threw their wealth at impossible schemes like moving to other worlds.
As things got worse,
a few of us managed to convince some of them
that the only solution was to move to Hell."

"Upload themselves?"
Iffy scoffed.
"An' then what,
you take their money while they're all bein' torn apart by malware?"

Wales shook his head.
"No.
I mean,
I wouldn't have cried if that happened.
Trust me,
anyone that rich makes the governor look like a saint.
No,
the idea was that we would imprint ourselves on the entire global network
so that we could fix the things no one else could.
People had tried it before,
but…"
He shrugged.
"We thought we had a couple of new angles,
and we were desperate."

He stared past her at the horizon.
"So we did the whole mad scientist thing with a secret underground lair
and a double-secret lab underneath that
and locked the door behind us.
Nothing in, nothing out, just two dozen of the smartest human beings alive
and enough equipment to settle on Mars."
He chuckled and pointed at his chest.
"Did I ever tell you that's actually what I was supposed to do?
All my genetic tweaks and this stuff in my head—it's all left over
from some previous bunch of mad scientists and *their* plan for saving the world."

"So what happened?"
Iffy asked despite herself after a few moments of silence.

"We had a vote,"
Wales said bleakly.
"We weren't ready,
but honestly,
we didn't know if we ever would be,
and things were getting worse faster than anyone had predicted.
We argued for a couple of days
and finally decided to go for it and hope for the best.
Everyone listened to their favorite music one last time
or had one last cup of coffee
and made jokes about seeing each other in the next life,
and then we climbed into our capsules and closed our eyes.
The next thing I knew I was on the floor of Beta Station
and everyone else was dead.
Everyone except you."

Iffy stared at him.
"Me?"
she asked,
but somehow she already knew what he was going to say next.

"Mm hm."
He took a small app out of his pocket and swiped.
"Don't worry,
it's completely off the network.
Here."

<span id="2024-04-25-a"></span>

He turned it around and held it out.
An older version of her own face looked back at her.
"Her name wasn't Ang Kwan,"
he said quietly.
"It was Jing-mei Yuen.
And while all of us were working on our project
she somehow found a way to work on one of her own.
She's the only other person from the team who survived.
Your First was a tweaked clone of her,
and I think she's the reason the machines woke up."

She burst out laughing.
After a moment Wales began to chuckle too.
"Well, it's not quite the reaction I was expecting,"
he started.

"You—you—"
Iffy hiccupped.
"You're skew.
D'you seriously 'spect me t' b'lieve that?"
She lowered her voice.
"Oh, Iffy, you're th' chosen one.
Only you can save th' world."

"Your First said pretty much the same thing before she shot me,"
Wales observed drily,
tapping his chest with one finger.
"It took me twenty years to track her down.
I don't know how she got to Cape Town or what happened to Jing-mei.
All I know is that she had the same talent you do.
Somehow she could—"
He took a deep breath.
"Somehow *you* can talk to them and get them to talk back.
Not just trade deals and warnings about no-go zones but actual conversations."

"So that makes th' machine wars my fault?"
Iffy shot back angrily.

Wales cocked his head.
"How old were you when you started seeing things?
Eight?
Nine?
If your First got her abilities at the same age,
that would be almost exactly the time the machines woke up.
It's quite a coincidence."

"And there's another thing,"
he continued as she opened her mouth to protest.
"I'm good with tech—really good by most people's standards—and
the people and cores working for the governors are at least as good.
We should have been able to track you and your elders down in minutes,
but somehow you all managed to stay hidden."

He looked up at the sky as if he could see the machines' satellites orbiting overhead.
For all Iffy knew, he actually could.
"Someone up there likes you, Iffy.
Someone or something has been looking out for you your whole life."

A lifetime of hurt and anger boiled up inside Iffy.
"Go t' hell,"
she spat.
"Wasn't anyone lookin' out for th' *Guinevere* when she went under
an' everyone drowned.
Wasn't anyone lookin' out for me 'cept Aunt Naggie when we were in dock
an' th' other kids knocked me around 'cuz I was bad luck.
What I got,
I got 'cuz o' *me*,
not some— some—"
She wiped her sleeve angrily across her face.

"I'm sorry,"
Wales said for the third time.
"I wish I'd been there."

For a minute the only sound was the wind and the distant *skee-rawk* of a lonely gull.
"Why'd she shoot you?"
Iffy finally asked.

Wales shrugged.
"I didn't give her a chance to get to know me
before I dumped the whole save-the-world thing on her shoulders.
And when she said no,
I tried to make her do it anyway.
That was a mistake."

Something clicked in Iffy's head.
"So bumpin' into me at th' Sandhus…"

"Wasn't exactly by chance, no.
But the drugs you've been getting?
Those are straight from the machines.
I stole a few grains once when you were younger, and—"
He shrugged again.
"Like I said, I'm pretty good with tech,
but I have no idea what it does or how the tweaks inside you work.
All I know is that I'm a hundred and forty-one years old
and I'm tired of making things worse."

He patted the toolbox.
"I brought everything you asked for.
What happens now is up to you.
If you want my help, it's yours.
If you want me to walk away and let you do this yourself,
I'll do that instead.
People like me and the governors,
we've had our chance.
It's your turn now."

Iffy drummed her fingers on the palm of her hand.
One two three four thumb,
one four two three thumb.
"Aright," she said.
"Let's go save th' affin' world."

## Chapter 14

It took half an hour to collect the other two bags that Wales had thrown off the train.
Iffy didn't ask how he had snuck aboard without being detected,
or how he had managed to get off.
As they trudged back to the waiting escape pod her thoughts were on her First.
Third had mostly looked after her with Fourth's occasional grudging help.
Iffy could remember an old woman with dark eyes and a sun-wrinkled face,
but that was about all.

Dinner was a double helping of cold ration bars.
*At least these ones taste diff'rent,*
Iffy thought as she chewed and swallowed.

Wales waited until she was done before giving her the rest of his news.
Halley's governor was locked away somewhere,
Paddington's was missing,
Brazilian ships were patrolling the coast,
and the *Guinevere* was still docked in Rothera.
"As bait," he shrugged.

She nodded and gave him an abbreviated version of her escape with Iñacio
and what had happened in Bharati.
His expression soured when she described the imprinted soldiers she had encountered.
"I've always wondered what actually happened.
But yours is just…gone?"

Iffy shrugged.
"I think so.
Can't talk t' her no more,
an' I don't think I got any o' her skills.
Tell you th' truth,
I kinda miss her.
It was like havin' a big sister or somethin'."
She hesitated.
"Any chance you seen Aunt Naggie or Honesty?
De got der call-up just before things blew up."

"You can blame the governor for that," Wales said.
"When Rothera's core told him you two were a thing
he thought he could der for leverage.
I'm sorry I didn't—"

"Stop sayin' that."
Iffy crumpled the ration bar's wrapper into a ball
and stuffed it into the little recycler Wales had unpacked.
"Stop sayin' you're sorry about this an' you regret that an' whatever.
It don't fix anything."

"Sorry,"
Wales said after a moment's pause,
then spread his hands when Iffy glared at him.

He stood and stretched.
"We probably shouldn't stay here much longer.
How about I rig myself a seat on this crash bucket of yours
while you figure out what we're going to do next?"

"I already know th' what,"
she said.
"What I gotta figure out is how."
She hesitated,
remembering what had happened when she and Sandrine had stolen the hovercraft.
"Don't s'pose you brought any o' my medicine with you?"

Wales shook his head.
"Sorry, but—okay, okay, um,
*unfortunately* it would have been too risky.
As far as I know the only supply in Rothera is on board your ship,
and if I'd tried to get it…"
He shrugged,
not needing to finish his sentence.

"Yeah."
Iffy rummaged around for a moment,
then pulled a sterile wipe out of the escape pod's medical kit,
tore it in half,
and stuffed the pieces in her nostrils.
"Here we go."

*Imagine being born with cataracts in your eyes,
unable to see anything more than blurs of light.
Now imagine that one day someone removed them.
You would still only see blurs
because your brain would never have had a chance to learn that
this pattern is a wall
and this other pattern is a chair.
People might have told you that things looked smaller if they were far away,
but the words alone wouldn't mean anything.
It would be weeks or months before you could make sense of
the signals your eyes were now able to send to your brain,
but it would get easier with practice.*

*Later,
lying in a sleeping bag in a tent two hundred kilometers away
while Wales spread a net of thermally superconductive cables around them
to hide the heat of their bodies from infrared sensors,
Iffy wondered whether talking to the machines was getting easier
because she had been doing it more often
or because of her time with Sandrine
or because she now knew where her ability had come from.
In the end she decided it didn't matter.
What mattered was that diving into that other world of information
felt more like opening her eyes
each time she did it.
Finding what she wanted was no more difficult now than reaching for a cup of tea,
and what had once seemed as chaotic as the Dance Hall market in Rothera
was now full of currents and rhythms and poetry.
She didn't understand it yet,
but for the first time she felt that she might.*

*And for the first time,
she had a plan.*
