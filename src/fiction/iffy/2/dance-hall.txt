*That ain't gonna work,* Iffy thought.
The drones overhead weren't allowed to be any smarter than seagulls,
but even something that dumb could recognize the way someone walked,
and the ecologist's face mask wouldn't conceal that.
If any of the drones caught a glimpse of them—

—and there it was.
How could she not have seen it before?
"Wait!"
Iffy pulled the box that Honesty's First had given her out from under her coat.
She had never been able to control her flashes of intuition,
but they had never been wrong either.

She knelt on the market floor and opened the box.
There and there together and then there,
two presses and a third, and *zip!*
A thin film in the center of the dronelet peeled back to reveal a foil battery,
a hair-thin fractal antenna,
and—

"*Shway boo*," she whispered unbelievingly.
The flat, unreflective black surface of the dronelet's core told Iffy that
it had been fabbed in orbit.
This was old tech—wartime old or older.

"Iffy, what're you doin?"
She ignored her foster mother and the alarms
and the pressure of the ecologist's stare
as she pulled tools out of her waistbelt.

"You got any scraps o' video this big?"
she asked over her shoulder,
holding her hands a few centimeters apart.

"Here."
The ecologist handed her half a dozen swatches of video fabric,
each the size of a handkerchief.
Iffy measured one against a dronelet,
then winced as she pried two of the rotors out of the stiff black fabric.
She'd never be able to repair the damage,
not even with the kind of tech she'd seen in Wales' toolboxes,
but she didn't dare cutting into the dronelet fabric itself.

It took her a moment to tuck the corners of the video square into the holes she'd made.
Now for the hard part.
She closed her eyes and willed the images to come together.
These bits were the dronelets—don't worry now
about how she knew or why she could see its programming
as clearly as she could see its hardware—and this over here was the video square.
*That* was its connection to the outside world,
so if she shone a laser *here* to send a pulse-coded access request,
then told the dronelet and the video square to trust each other no matter what their other programming said,
then—

"Gotcha!"
The dronelet rose, tilted, and levelled
as the image on its back flickered and steadied to show the top of a woman's head.

The ecologist grunted.
"She really can do it, can't she?" he said to Aunt Naggie.

Iffy's foster mother nodded.
"Y'aright?" she asked Iffy.

"I'm fine," Iffy lied.
Her head was swimming.
Everything around her seemed unreal.
The stalls were just wireframes.
Her dronelets were clouds of software,
patched and patched again to defend against viruses
until there was only room for the most limited intelligence,
but Aunt Naggie and the ecologist were dense clouds of history
stretching away in a direction that wasn't really a direction.
It was like something out of a badly-written sim.

"Iffy!" Aunt Naggie shook her.
The world blinked back to normal.
"Iffy, c'mon, we gotta go."

"Just a second!"
Eighty-five seconds later
two more awkward patch-ups hummed quietly in the air beside her.
She took a deep breath and transmitted one last set of instructions.

The patches of video fabric flickered.
The images solidified to show top-down views of Iffy, Aunt Naggie,
and someone whom she hoped looked enough like the ecologist to convince a drone.
"Start walkin'," she ordered the two adults.
"Just a coupla steps. Aright, that's enough."
*I hope,* she added to herself.

She strung a few more commands together and threw them into the dronelets' cores.
They began to sway slightly in an unconvincing imitation of
the way people moved when walking.
"Which way's Alphabet Street?" she asked muzzily.
Her tongue felt like a piece of uncooked soy
and she was pretty sure that if she turned her head too quickly she'd throw up.

A few moments later the dronelets were on their way north
with (Iffy hoped) the drones on their trail.
She, Aunt Naggie, and the ecologist hurried in the opposite direction.
As they turned left by a rack of bicycles and a stall selling rolls of microfiber sailcloth,
a man in front of them asked,
"Ya think they trappa thief?"

"Hell says they sweepin fer a sab,"
the woman beside him replied,
scanning a feed only she could see through heavy yellow-tinted glasses.

Her companion snorted.
"Bad case o someone din't pay off the blues is more likely."
His companion shushed him.

Even as she did so the drones above boomed,
"Citizens!
We have obtained the warrant you requested!
It's as fresh as Volkov's Number Two hot sauce!"
Every screen in the Dance Hall blanked for an instant
and then came back to life showing a younger version of the ecologist.
Instead of a suit,
he wore the green and gold uniform of the Brazilian Defense Co-operative.

"You're a Zillion?" Iffy gasped.

The ecologist pulled his arm out of Aunt Naggie's.
"Keep walkin," he ordered,
yanking the orange knit cap off his head.
Without waiting for a reply he turned right toward a stall
selling animated toys and compact ship-board cooking equipment.

A pair of Marines stepped out from behind it.
One raised a shock stick as the other levelled a tangle gun.
"Citizen! Halt!" they said in unison.

"Este mundo é de deus!" the ecologist yelled.
He threw himself to the side,
tossing his cap into the air.
It exploded into a cloud of orange twinkles
just as the Marine's tangle gun burped a web of sticky plastic microfibers.
People shrieked as the shot went wide,
the gun's auto-sight dazzled by the ecologist's counter-measures.

The couple in front of Iffy and Aunt Naggie fell to the ground,
shouting and struggling as the sticky plastic tightened around them.
The ecologist vaulted over a counter-top,
knocked aside a wok full of steaming noodlesf,
and pulled up short
as another pair of Marines clanked around the corner to block his way.

"Iffy, c'mon, we gotta go!" Aunt Naggie tugged her arm.

Iffy shook her off, tapping frantically at her keypad.
There!
Her three dronelets zipped through the air straight for the Marines.
The soldiers spun around,
their inducted reflexes pulling their weapons up in the face of an unknown new threat
just long enough for the ecologist to look wildly around for another way out.

But there wasn't one.
Two—no, three—of the Marines' drones buzzed overhead
as a Marine chambered another stubby canister in his tangle gun.

The ecologist made a fist and pressed it against his temple.
Aunt Naggie shrieked "no!"
The lights around them flickered.
The ecologist's head snapped back.
He collapsed like a puppet whose strings had been cut.

Iffy gaped in disbelief.
He had brainwiped himself!
Spies and disappointed lovers did it in sims, but this was real life!
People didn't scramble their brains in real life!

Aunt Naggie made a strangled sound
as the Marines swarmed the twitching form on the ground.

Iffy pulled her foster mother to the side and tapped one final command.
The three dronelets reappeared a few moments later.
Iffy tore off the video fabric off them and stuffed them back in their box.
"C'mon," she told Aunt Naggie.
"Let's a home."
