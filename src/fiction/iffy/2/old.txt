## Chapter 1

Iffy had a bad dream that night.
It was the same one she always had,
and the worst part was that it wasn't really a dream.

She was on deck.
The Antarctic sky was a blue bowl overhead,
summer cold instead of winter freezing.
Second and Third were stuffing her into
a hand-me-down ecosuit that had cost them as much as one of their jelly dredging nets.
"Just t' be safe, love," Third said,
forcing a smile but unable to keep the fear out of her voice.
She kissed the family's youngest clone on the forehead
and slipped Iffy's favorite bedtime book inside the bulky orange suit.
"Just in case."

The ship's horn blared another warning.
Iffy started to cry.
Her olders had pulled her out of bed just a few moments before,
and she was only half awake.

Third hugged her again before Second pulled her away.
"There's no time," the older clone snapped
as one of the hired crew ran past them toward the stern.
At the time Iffy thought Second was angry at her for something she'd done.
Years later she realized that Second had been angry at the sea for what was about to happen,
and at herself for not being able to stop it.

"She's boilin'!" Fourth shouted from the crow's nest.
"Two hundred meters ahead an' ten points off starboard!"

Third sealed the last flap on the ecosuit.
This time Second didn't try to stop her when she wrapped her arms around Iffy.
"I love you," she said in Iffy's ear.
"I love you always an' forever."

"I love you too," Iffy replied tearfully.
She tried to return Third's hug,
but the thick insulation in the suit made it hard to bend her arms.

Second bent over and kissed them both on the tops of their heads.
She smelled like engine oil and the soap she always used when she shaved her head.
That was what Iffy remembered afterward—that,
and the stench of methane rising out of the sea around them.
Hundreds of meters below,
a million tiny bubbles of gas trapped in ancient clathrate ice on the sea floor
were about to burst free.

The deck pitched sideways as First tried desperately
to steer the *Rushin Doll* out of the mass of foam seething around them.
"She's blowin'! She's blowin'!" Fourth shouted.
The ship's horn blared one last time.
Iffy heard a sound like a thousand pots boiling together,
and then Third closed the ecosuit's faceplate and dogged it.

The ship staggered and dropped two meters.
Iffy screamed as she tumbled onto the deck.
Second and Third landed in a tangle beside beside her.
Ice-cold sea water crashed down on top of them.
Iffy screamed again as it dragged her and her olders against the metal taffrail.
Her olders grabbed for it,
but the ship dropped again
as the gas rising from the ocean floor
churned the water into a froth too thin to hold the boat afloat.
The last thing Iffy saw before the water closed over her
was Fourth falling from the crow's nest,
her arms and legs flailing against the perfect blue sky.

Her dream stopped then,
just like it always did.
She didn't remember the sea snapping the *Rushin Doll*'s keel,
or the ecosuit's tiny core deciding that the safest place for her to be
was anywhere but there.
The suit was a hundred years old,
but its seals held.
It kept her warm while the thumb-sized motors in its arms and legs
steered her clear of the after-bubbles that would have swallowed a lifeboat.

She didn't remember the *Guinevere* finding her hours later,
either,
or being hauled out of the sea in a jelly dredging net.
The woman she came to call Aunt Naggie said it was a miracle Iffy had survived.
It was even more of a miracle that she was allowed to stay on the dredger that found her.
The *Guinevere*'s captain,
Uncle Jack,
didn't like children.
Or animals.
Or foreigners or the governor
or the co-ops that bought the jellyfish he and Aunt Naggie dredged out of the Weddell Sea
or the people who sold him supplies
or passers-by who looked at him the wrong way
or didn't have the decency to look at him at all.
He would have dropped her on the pier and sailed away.
The docksiders in Rothera never understood why he didn't,
and wouldn't have believe that
his long-suffering wife had put her hands on her hips
and told him that the child was staying or she was leaving,
which was it going to be?

So Iffy stayed, but not the ecosuit.
Uncle Jack had two pairs that night,
eights over fives,
but the Aussie across the table had three sixes.
"You were gonna outgrow it anyway,"
he snapped over her tearful protests when she found out it was gone.
"Gotta pay for your keep somehow."

He would have gambled away the book tucked into the suit as well
if Aunt Naggie hadn't misplaced it until he forgot about it.
It had belonged to Third when she was Iffy's age,
and to Second before that,
and came from a time when people made books out of paper
and there were still whales and tigers and giraffes.
Iffy read a few pages every night no matter how tired she was from chores.
She drew the pictures from memory on her app when she was bored by school,
and on those rare occasions when another child came on board to play with her,
she took out the book and told them all about *orcinus orca* and *panthera tigris*
and her favorite, *giraffa camelopardalis*.

"They were too real!" she said fiercely whenever anyone expressed any doubts.
"Real as gulls and jellies!"
Real as the handwritten comments in the book's margins that she spent hours deciphering.
Real as being hungry and lonely,
she sometimes added to herself as she grew older
and Uncle Jack's business deals left them a little poorer each season.

Iffy woke that morning to the sound of Aunt Naggie bustling about in the galley.
She lay on the narrow foam packing slab she used as a mattress for one final precious moment
before slithering out of her salvaged sleeping bag
and pulling a layer of clothes over her thermals.
That banging was her foster mother's way of telling her that Uncle Jack was awake.
If she knew what was good for her,
she'd be up on deck doing something useful
before he stumbled out into the light looking for someone to yell at.

She closed her eyes and opened her nature book at random.
It was ridiculous—Jeep had made fun of her for a month
when he found out—but…

"Figures," she muttered when she opened her eyes.
The armadillo wasn't the most ridiculous animal in the book,
but it wasn't her favorite.
Still,
an armadillo day was better than a blobfish day.
She tucked the book into the slit she had cut in the foam slab to keep it safe,
yawned,
rubbed the stubble on her scalp,
and undogged the door of the storage locker
that had been her cabin for the past eight years.

As she stepped out onto the deck of the *Guinevere*
the sights and sounds and smells of Halley harbor splashed over her
like the waves in her nightmare.
She stopped for a moment to let her eyes adjust to the light.
To seaward lay the broken hulk of a carrier
that had driven itself aground a century before
to create a seawall for the town's harbor.
Dozens of ships and boats bobbed gently up and down in its lee.
Some were as old as the carrier,
patched and re-patched over the years like the *Guinevere* to stay seaworthy.
Others were newer:
broad-beamed cargo haulers flying the Aussie stars and gears
or streamlined Zillion-built clippers with bright kite sails furled around triple masts.
Gulls wheeled overhead in their endless search for scraps,
complaining to one another about how cold the Antarctic summer was
and how nobody threw away really good stuff any more.

The town watched the harbor like a grumpy old man watching children at play.
Back before,
Halley had been a research station where scientists studied the early signs of the Melt.
As the ice disappeared and life back home became desperate
they converted their labs into temporary houses.
By the time their children were grown they stopped doing research
or calling the houses "temporary".

Two thousand people now made Halley their home under the governors' watchful eyes.
During the summer blooms they dredged jellyfish out of the sea
to render down for fuel and fertilizer.
When winter came they tended the town's precious greenhouses
or sailed north to Patagonia or the Australian territories
to find whatever work might get them through the long dark
so that they could start the cycle again.

Iffy shaded her eyes against the razor-edged sun.
A cluster of buildings was taking shape by the newly built pier on the edge of town.
Two were just bunkhouses,
but one was a general store,
and another—the big one that Iffy had watched like a hungry gull all spring—was a machine shop.
Shiploads of precious equipment had already been carted through its double-wide doors:
forges, presses, a lathe with a spindle thicker than Iffy's leg,
and the prize of them all,
an industrial printer from Nova Zembla at the opposite end of the earth.

It had arrived in the hold of a heavily-armed Aussie destroyer.
The whole town had turned out when the sleek warship came into harbor,
railguns bristling and drones darting back and forth above her.
They lined the streets and cheered
as the destroyer's crew and a squad of Marines escorted the boxy machine through Halley's streets
to the quarantine shed by the new pier.
Once Halley's core finished its months-long check for malware,
the only limit to what the printer could make
would be the plans and raw materials people could give it.

Iffy had seen some of those plans glowing softly
above the tables of Halley's three cafés.
She had taken surreptitious notes on her app instead of doing homework
while mechanics and engineers and core techs argued about weights and tolerances and expansion coefficients,
then spent hours looking up words she didn't know and figuring out how they fit together.

She wanted to be part of those conversations so much it ached.
But even more than that,
she wanted to know why things she *hadn't* seen kept popping into her head.
Ghostly shapes flickered behind her eyes if she thought too hard about the plans:
fractal capacitors,
resonant heat sinks,
and ever-so-slightly irregular gears
whose off-center spin would automatically synchronize to minimize power coupling.
She had gone as deep into Hell as she dared to find anything that matched,
but every trail ended in "no results" or a blinking scarlet "restricted" warning.
After a couple of those she had stopped looking,
afraid of who or what might notice.

"Girl! Girl! Dammit, woman, where is that affin' girl?"
Iffy jumped as Uncle Jack bellowed from below deck.
He had been out with his biffs the night before,
which was Uncle Jack-speak for drinking more than he could handle
and gambling more than they could afford.
Aunt Naggie somehow managed to winkle enough out of his app while he was snoring to keep the *Guinevere* afloat,
but it had been weeks since they'd had fresh fruit,
and she couldn't remember the last time there had even been mention of new clothes
or of replacing their frayed nets.

"Girl!" Uncle Jack shouted again.
"Get your affin' tail down here *now* or saints help me you'll be scrapin' barnacles for a *week*!"
She heard a meaty *thud!* as he slapped the bulkhead with his hand for emphasis.

With one last longing look at the distant machine shop,
Iffy lifted the hatch beside her and scrambled down the ladder.
"I'm right here, Uncle Jack," she said breathlessly. "I was just—"

"You were just lyin' about like some fairytale princess an' don't try to tell me otherways!"
The *Guinevere*'s captain glared up at her,
squinting as the bright sky framing her head assaulted his hungover eyes.
There was a bruise on his forehead that hadn't been there at dinner, Iffy noticed.
That might mean a visit from the Marines later.
He'd scowl and mutter and make excuses to them,
then bluster to Aunt Naggie after they were gone
about how the governors were just a bunch of meat puppets
and how the town's cores were going to sell them all out to the Zillions
as soon as they could get a decent price.

"Your eggs'll be ready in a mo," Aunt Naggie cut in hurriedly
as Uncle Jack opened his mouth to unleash another bellow.
"Do you want a bit o' curry on them?
I think I have—no, wait, not there…"
She rummaged nervously among the precious little glass jars
that sat on the shelf beside the galley's little two-loop stove.

"Affin' right I want a bit o' curry," Uncle Jack grumbled,
settling into a fold-up chair that squeaked under his weight.

Iffy's stomach grumbled as the smell of eggs, turmeric, and cumin teased her nostrils.
With a tilt of her frying pan and a single practiced flip of her spatula,
Aunt Naggie slid two perfectly fried eggs into Uncle Jack's bowl.
Without so much as a grunt of acknowledgment,
her husband took the entire basket of naan from the center of table in one hand
and his plate with the other
and disappeared back into his cabin.
Just before the door closed
Iffy heard glass clink and something gurgle out of a bottle.

Aunt Naggie let out the breath she'd been holding
and smiled at her foster daughter.
"You'll be hungry then?"

"Not really," Iffy lied.

"Course not. Here."
She pulled a hard-boiled egg out of the pocket of her apron and slipped it to Iffy.
"An' here, this too."
A piece of perfectly-browned naan,
still warm and slightly sticky with oil,
appeared out of another pocket.

"Thanks auntie," Iffy said gratefully.
"You eat already?"

"Course, first thing," Aunt Naggie lied in turn.
She leaned over and kissed the stubble on top of her foster daughter's head.
"You best get that in you quick an' start work on that winch cable he's after havin' tightened.
An' he says th' engine's got a knock in it again—best have a look at that too before it starts to bother him."

"It's th' reciprocating rod," Iffy said around a mouthful of fluffy naan.
"Mister Mishra will straighten it out if I take it in before he gets busy.
It won't cost anythin',"
she added hastily before her foster mother could object.
"Not if I do a couple o' little jobs for him.
I could head over right now if you wanted."

"If *I* wanted?"
Aunt Naggie teased.
"Well,
if you're goin' that way
can you stop in at Sandhu's an' see what they want for more eggs?
Those were our last ones.
I'll tell Jack you're off doing chores once he's…"
She finished her sentence with an apologetic shrug.

"Thanks auntie," Iffy said gratefully.
She climbed the ladder and hurried aft as quietly as she could.

The ship's toolbox rattled as she dragged it out from under the bench at the *Guinevere*'s stern.
Its cast-offs and hand-me-downs only included things so essential that even Uncle Jack wouldn't sell them.
After a furtive glance over her shoulder,
she reached up under the bench and unclipped the canvas bag that held *her* tools,
the ones she had salvaged and mended or been given in return for doing odd jobs for people around the harbor.
She pushed the toolbox back into place and tucked her toolbag under her coat.

It only took her a few moments to disengage the bent rod from the engine and tuck it into a pocket.
She closed the engine casing as gently as she could and hurried down the gangplank,
the weight of life on the *Guinevere* lifting from her shoulders
as soon as her boots hit the pier.

The Antarctic summer didn't have days or nights,
but ships and people kept to clock time as best they could.
A pair of old women were awake early
to scrape gene-tweaked barnacles off long strips of plastic they had hung off the piers months before.
Hundreds of little shells glittered with tiny particles of metal they had filtered out of the water.
Ground down and incinerated,
they would yield a few grams of copper or manganese
that could keep some old piece of tech limping along for another season.

One of the women straightened and raised a hand in greeting as Iffy went by.
"Beautiful day," she said. "You headin' t' town?"

"Am that," Iffy nodded,
not wanting to slow down for a conversation.

The old woman nodded back.
"You be careful, aye?
The *Taroona* came in yesterday,
and those pirates been bustin' up ever since."

"Thanks," Iffy said dutifully.
The old woman smiled and bent back to her strips and buckets.

The teens at the head of the pier arguing over how best to hang a net for mending
glanced at her as she went by but didn't say anything.
Iffy didn't expect them to.
*At least they don't cross their fingers and spit,* she thought.
Sailors were superstitious, and she was a sole survivor.
Nobody looked at her sidelong and whispered
like they had when the loss of her family's ship was still fresh,
but despite Aunt Naggie's best efforts,
Iffy had found that friends were something that mostly happened to other people.

*Mishra & Co Fine Technical Work - No Job Too Small!* occupied a long shed
that might or might not have been the oldest building in Halley.
The sliding door that took up half its front wall hadn't been opened since before she was born,
so she banged on the smaller door cut into it.

It scraped open on her third knock.
"Hey Jeep,"
she said brightly to the boy scowling at her from inside.
"Is your da here?"
She held up the bent reciprocating rod by way of explanation.

"He's in back," Jeep muttered,
jerking his thumb over his shoulder and making just enough room for Iffy to squeeze past him.

The inside of the shed was a humid mug of long-ago fish,
freshly singed metal,
and the not-entirely-legal compost bricks Mister Mishra burned in the furnace
to keep his equipment from freezing in the winter.
Mismatched light squares hung from the ceiling on hair-thin fibers.
The shadows they cast made the compact machines
and shelves of carefully sorted scrap on the shop floor
look like battlebots from old war sims.
They had frightened Iffy the first time she ventured among them,
but all she saw now was what they could make—what *she* could make with them.

Mister Mishra was sharpening his fingers on a grinding wheel in the center of the shop.
He nodded at Iffy but didn't speak until the last sparks had flown off his steel nails
and the wheel spun down to a halt.
Pulling his safety goggles up onto his forehead,
he tugged the calloused fingers of his real hand through the tangles in his beard.
"Buy, sell, or trade?" he asked.

"Trade," Iffy said.
She held up the bent reciprocating rod.
"Tangled some flotsam comin' in from our last dredge.
The engine over-spun before I could get to it.
There's no cracks or nothin'," she added hastily,
handing the piece to him.
"Just needs t' be re-angled an' annealed."

"Hm."
The wiry machinist turned the rod over in his hands,
sighted along its length,
then held it up to his good ear and tapped it with his metal fingers.
Iffy had seen him go through this ritual more times than she could count,
and still didn't know if the quiet metal *tick* was just a bluff
or if he really could hear flaws too small for eyes to see.

He handed the rod back to her.
"She'll be aright enough once she's straightened," he pronounced.
"But it'll cost you."

The tension eased out of Iffy's shoulders.
Mister Mishra didn't bargain unless he'd already decided that he was going to say yes.
After that it was just a matter of price.

In the end,
getting the rod bent straight cost her half an hour of sorting scraps for smelting.
It wasn't the machine work she'd hoped for,
but she had learned that if she timed her questions right
he would take a minute here and there to show her
how to dog the belaying plate on the laser drill
or how to line up a set of gatling hammers to rat-a-tat-tat a piece of sheet metal into a graceful springy curve.
She was careful never to stare at the burn scar where his left ear should have been
or at the fractal spider's web of articulated metal that had replaced his left forearm.
She was equally careful not to look up when his son Jeep slouched in
to say that lunch was ready but *amma* said he had to clean up first.

"You hungry?" Mister Mishra asked
as he spun the handwheel on the drill to lift the laser into its locking position.

"No thanks—I brought," Iffy said,
holding up the egg Aunt Naggie had given her.

"Hm." Mister Mishra ran his fingers through his beard again.
"Not much to grow on."

"It'll do me fine,"
Iffy said more stiffly than she intended.
She nodded toward the laser drill as casually as she could.
"You mind I try a couple of pieces while you're out?"

Mister Mishra shook his head.
"Nuh uh, girl.
Nobody touches my darlin' without I'm here to watch.
You break that,
I'll have t' send up t' Amundsen for parts,
and odds are they have t' send all the way up to Taz."

"Aright," Iffy said,
feigning disappointment even though she'd known what the answer would be.
"How about I use th' mechanical one instead?
Just for learnin'," she added hastily.
"It's not paid work or nothin'.
I'll just drill some scrap—you can count it all in an' out t' make sure."

Mister Mishra chuckled.
"No worry about th' scrap, girl.
An' no worry about gettin' paid.
If you found work hereabouts that I haven't, more power to you."
He rolled his head to loosen the kinks in his neck
and waggled the digits of his artificial hand.
"Mind your eyes an' fingers, aye?"

"Aye," Iffy agreed eagerly.
She had her scavenged safety goggles on her face and the drill bit engaged
before Mister Mishra reached the door.

Drilling holes wasn't hard—she'd learned how to do that long ago.
The hard part was drilling them in the right place.
After examining and discarding half a dozen pieces of scrap,
she found one that was bent enough to be a challenge.

The first hole only took a minute.
It then took her another fifteen minutes to measure,
mark,
measure again,
swear under her breath,
find a pair of calipers in the chaos on top of Mister Mishra's toolbench,
chock the piece,
measure a third time,
and re-align everything juuuuust a little.
A bot could have done the whole job in a millisecond,
but bots could be hacked or infected with malware left over from the war.
"You want it fast, use a bot," Mister Mishra always said.
"You want it *safe*, do it yourself."

Slowly, steadily, Iffy brought the spinning drillbit down
until it just barely kissed the metal and—

"What are you doin'?"
She jumped and spun around.
Jeep was leaning against a set of shelves,
arms crossed and scowl firmly in place.

"Just practicin'," she said defensively.
"Aren't you supposed t' be havin' lunch or something?"

His scowl deepened.
"Finished. Does my da know what you're about?"

"Course he does."
Iffy scratched a sudden itch on her nose,
then pulled her hand back down to her side.
Mister Mishra *did* know, and she had nothing to be embarrassed about.

"Uh huh. What about your uncle?" Jeep asked,
looking everywhere but straight at her.
"He still bein' trash on you?"

Iffy shrugged.
"Comes an' goes."
She and Jeep had talked a few times
when she first started coming to use his father's equipment.
He had shown her a few of his animations
and she had shared a few stories about life at sea.
For a while she had thought he was working up the courage
to maybe do more than that,
but…

The silence stretched uncomfortably.
"I gotta get back t' this," she finally said,
waving a hand at the drill press idling behind her.

Jeep straightened up.
"Wouldn't you rather be doin' somethin useful?"

"This *is* useful!" Iffy said hotly.
"And it's none o' your business what I do or don't."
She turned back to the drill,
placing her foot firmly on the pedal that controlled the motor's speed.

"Didn't say it was my business," Jeep said belligerently.
"But if anythin' here gets bust up—"

"Anythin' here gets bust up your *da* will know it was me that did it
because it ain't like *you* put your hands to any o' this!" Iffy snapped.
She cranked the drill bit up into its locked position and switched the machine off.
"Here!" Three quick twists undid the chocks that held her test piece in place.
She tossed it at him harder than the distance required,
then took the calipers from the work tray on the side of the drill
and slapped them back onto the bench.
"Gimme a sec an' I'll sweep up th' shavings for you to weigh
so you can be sure you got everythin'."

Without waiting for answer she pulled the goggles down around her neck
and grabbed the old broom that stood next to a broken sonic press like a forgotten sentry.
Jeep watched her sweep,
anger and something that might have been embarrassment written on his face.
"You missed a bit," he finally said,
pointing at a random patch of floor before turning and stalking away.
The door banged behind him.

Iffy emptied the dustpan into the trash and tossed her goggles into her toolbag.
It wasn't fair—Jeep could use the equipment any time he wanted,
but all he ever did was complain and look for ways not to.

The worst thing was,
she knew it wasn't Jeep's fault he was like this.
Like everyone else in Antarctica
he had been inducted into the Marines when he turned sixteen.
He'd only served a quarter—just long enough to be sure that the imprinting had worked—but
having someone else's personality temporarily pushed down on top of his own had changed him.
"He'll come back eventually," Mister Mishra said the one time Iffy broached the subject,
his tone making it clear that she shouldn't bring it up again.
"It just takes some folk longer than others t' find their way home."

The sky was the same relentless blue it had been an hour earlier when Iffy stepped outside
with the straightened reciprocating rod safely stowed inside her coat.
She peeled her egg as she hurried up the street toward the grocery store,
trying not to get machine grease on it as she devoured the rubbery white flesh and the warm yellow-brown yolk.
A couple of Aunt Naggie's friends smiled or waved as she went by.
She nodded back,
ignoring the others who shook their heads at the sight of a scruffy little jelly dredger
in a stained coat and boots two sizes too big for her.

A commotion down a side street caught her ear.
Someone was singing off-key.
Another voice joined in, then a third, and then glass broke on stone.
"Bloody pirates," a passer-by muttered to his companion.
"Governors shoulda sunk the *Taroona*, not let her berth."

The second man elbowed him.
"I'm sure th' governors know what's best," he said loudly,
shooting a warning look in Iffy's direction.
Iffy kept her eyes on the cobblestones and hurried on her way.

Sandhu's grocery store was out of eggs.
They had onions,
though,
and a box of dried green peppers that had come in from somewhere carefully unspecified.
Little Mrs. Sandhu wrapped half a dozen slices in wax paper.
"For your beautiful aunt," she said over Iffy's protests,
just as she did every time she gave her something extra.
"An' here, take this too.
A little of our special curry mix.
I know how much you like it."
She handed Iffy a small plastic jar of orange-brown powder.

Big Mrs. Sandhu snorted just as *she* always did.
"You should take Nagatha your presents yourself," she scolded.

Her wife smiled.
"*La,* but where would be th' romance in that?"

Big Mrs. Sandhu snorted again.
"You just don't want any o' your special friends down th' harbor
to know about each another."

Whatever Little Mrs. Sandhu might have said next
was cut short by a jingle from the bell on the store's front door.
Three heads turned at a cheerful, "Good morning!"
as the squarest man Iffy had ever seen walked in.

"Square" really was the only word for him.
He wasn't much taller than Iffy,
but three of her could have stood side by side in the span of his shoulders.
Strong white teeth gleamed against his black skin when he smiled,
and the small silvery rectangles of tech in his temples
made him look like he had stepped out of an adventure sim.

"Good mornin, *sri*," Big Mrs. Sandhu said, bowing her head slightly.
"Is there something we could help you with?"

"Just some advice, ma'am, if you've any of that for sale?"
His twanging accent sounded American to Iffy,
though the only Americans she had ever heard had been preaching in the market
or villains in stories.

"Advice is always free here," Little Mrs. Sandhu simpered,
wiping her hands on her apron.
Big Mrs. Sandhu looked sidelong at Iffy and rolled her eyes.
Iffy bit back a laugh—Little Mrs. Sandhu's flirting was as famous in Halley
as her smuggled vegetables.

"Thank you," the square man said.
"I'm just in from South Georgia,
and I'm in need of a place to stay for a few days.
I don't suppose you could recommend somewhere that isn't too expensive?"
He spread his hands apologetically.
"It seems that my luggage went missing in transit."

"Oh you poor *cho*," Little Mrs. Sandhu clucked sympathetically.

Big Mrs. Sandhu shook her head.
"That'd be the *Taroona* you come in on?"
When the newcomer nodded she shook her head again.
"They're *bura badi*,
that crew,
pirates and leggers and worse.
You're lucky if all they nickered was your bags an' not your kidneys."

The square man sighed.
"That may be, but I confess that I don't feel particularly lucky.
I was hoping to set myself up in business, but without my tools…"
He shrugged sadly.

"What kind o' tools?" Iffy asked.
She had been about to slip away—her uncle would be looking for her soon,
and she didn't want to leave Aunt Naggie to deal with his ire on her own—but
tools were worth a few extra seconds.

The square man grimaced.
"A couple of half-mil waldoes,
a sintering laser,
a fractal de-ionizer for cleaning chaff off old cores,
a set of diffraction lenses,
and—"

"There's no such thing as a fractal de-ionizer,"
Iffy cut in scornfully.

The square man blinked.
"Sure there is.
You take the ionizer out of a differential micromagnetic filter,
stick it in a high-conductance fractal mesh,
and boom—there's your de-ionizer."

"Huh.
Feedback would slag that th' second you turned it on,"
Iffy scoffed.

"If you're careless, sure," the square man agreed.
"You have to recalibrate the impedance every once in a while so that it doesn't overheat.
But if you have a micropore evaporator—"

"—you can bleed in liquid nitrogen to quench the thermal,"
Iffy finished,
the solution suddenly clear in her head.

"Exactly."
The newcomer cocked his head,
looking at Iffy as if she was some strange machine he had to repair.

"Well, if you two are done comparin' notes,
there's a coupla places I can point you at,"
Big Mrs. Sandhu cut in briskly.
"Can't promise they'll be cheap,
but they're clean,
an' you won't wake up in the middle o' the night with any o' your parts gone."

"Thank you," the square man said absently, still studying Iffy.
"And if you don't mind me asking another question,
where did your daughter learn so much about tech?
There are people with a lot of years on them
that wouldn't have thought to worry about the resonance feedback."

"Oh, Iffy's not ours,"
Little Mrs. Sandhu said lightly.
"She's crew off a jelly dredger."

"I see."
The square man nodded as if that explained everything
and stuck out his hand.
"Johnson Wales," he said.
"Pleased to meet you."

Iffy hesitated,
then took his hand and shook it.
"Fifth Ang Kwan, but everyone calls me Iffy.
Pleased to meet you too."

## Chapter 2

Iffy ran all the way back to the docks,
dodging around the people and bots going about their chores
in Halley's narrow cobblestone streets.
"*Gardez-vous!* *Gardez-vous!*"
scolded the centipede-shaped fixit bot everyone called French Henry.
She squeezed between its rust-streaked frame
and a rack of insulating moss
and kept running.

The barnacle farmers were still bent over their work when she reached the pier.
She stopped and put her hands on her knees to catch her breath.
"How's yer haul?" she panted.

"Not bad," one of them said.
She nudged a scratched blue bucket of barnacles with her boot.
"Prob'ly get thirty grams outta this when it renders down.
That'll buy a nice dinner."
Her smile showed more gaps than teeth.

"Good luck," Iffy said.
She straightened up and walked quickly the rest of the way to the *Guinevere*,
her lips moving as she practiced what she was going to say.

Metal clanged on metal as she reached the ship.
"Affin'… shaddin'… dammit!" Uncle Jack swore,
a wrench in one hand and a screw cuff in the other.
Iffy's heart sank.
He was trying to mend the backstay cable she had patched up a few days ago.
It was a fiddly job at the best of times,
and if he had a hangover…

The scowl on his face turned stormy as he caught sight of her.
"Where th' hole you been, girl?" he demanded,
waving the wrench at her.
"There's work needs done!
An don't give me any excuses!"
he continued as Iffy opened her mouth.
"You get this mended an' earn your keep or so help me!"

"But—"

"Now!"
Heads turned on nearby ships as Uncle Jack's bellow echoed across the water.

Ears burning,
Iffy climbed the gangplank onto the deck.
Her heart sank a second time when she saw the mess waiting for her.
Her uncle had undone the screw cuff holding the frayed backstay cable together
and trimmed the two ends flat.
He hadn't left enough to weave back together,
not without shortening the cable by half a meter.
She would have to swap the whole cable for one of the forestays,
which meant an hour at least of unwinding and hauling.

Uncle Jack crossed his arms,
tapping his wrench against the stained thermal vest
that he had worn for as long as Iffy could remember.
"So where you been while th' rest of us been workin', eh?"

"Groceries," Iffy said sullenly.
She pulled the mended reciprocating rod out of her jacket and held it up.
"Got this fixed too."

Uncle Jack pulled it roughly from her hand.
"Don't see no groceries," he grumbled accusingly,
squinting at the rod.

"I just asked her to pick up a coupla things,"
Aunt Naggie said,
sticking her head up through an open hatch
like a turtle cautiously checking that the world outside its shell was safe.
"Did they have eggs?"

"Nope, but I got some peppers."
Iffy fished the items she had bought out of her jacket's deep pockets.
"Oh, an' Little Mrs. Sandhu said to give you this."
She held up the little jar of curry.

"Oh, that's kind," Aunt Naggie clucked
as she tucked everything into her apron.
"Did you get anything more to eat?
I was going t' make noodles."

"It's aright, I'm not hungry," Iffy lied,
and then she couldn't hold back any longer.
"But auntie,
there was a man at Sandhu's,
a mechanic come down to work in th' machine shop,
'cept he was on the *Taroona* and they stole his gear
so he was askin' after a place t' stay,
an' we got to talkin',
an' he said that if he could get his tools back an' find work an all,
he might be lookin' for an apprentice."

"An apprentice?" Aunt Naggie echoed.
"Well, good for Jeep.
It's about time he got out and did somethin'."

"Not Jeep!" Iffy exclaimed, unable to hold back any longer.
"He said he'd look to take me!"
The two Mrs. Sandhus had listened with bemusement
as her conversation with Mister Wales—"call me Johnson, please"—leaped from de-ionizers
to different ways to micro-weld the cracked cases of old cores
to the mended reciprocating rod Iffy took out of her coat to show him.
It wasn't until Big Mrs. Sandhu had cleared her throat
and pointedly suggested that the conversation continue
where they *wouldn't* be blocking the aisle
that Iffy had realized how much time had gone by.

Uncle Jack's hand came down heavily on her shoulder.
"You're not goin' anywhere," he growled,
shaking her for emphasis.
"Not 'til you've paid off every last rand you owe us
for lookin' after you all this time."

Something froze inside Iffy.
"Aright," she said coldly,
knocking his arm away.
"How 'bout you an' me go ask the *Ginny* to pull up the accounts
so I can see just how much that is,
and I'll tell you how much you owe me
for keeping her afloat when you're too wrung out to do it yourself,
an' then we'll see who owes who what!"

"What we'll see is how well you swim!"
Uncle Jack roared,
raising the heavy wrench he was holding like a club.

"No!"
Aunt Naggie yanked Iffy back and stepped in front of her irate husband.
"Jack, don't!
She's just talkin',
that's all."

Uncle Jack shook the wrench at them.
"I best see more outta both of you than just talkin'," he snarled.
"Now get me some affin' lunch, woman.
And you!"
He jabbed a finger at Iffy.
"Fix that shaddin' cable.
I want us ready to sail tomorrow."

"She'll do it right away, I promise," Aunt Naggie said.
Her arm tightened around Iffy's shoulders,
a silent warning not to say anything.

Uncle Jack stalked off,
muttering under his breath.
"You come below and help me with th' noodles,"
Aunt Naggie said,
shooing Iffy toward the open hatch.
"That'll give him time to calm down."

"Yes auntie," Iffy said,
her voice only slightly shaky.
Uncle Jack had never actually hit her—as simple-minded as the *Guinevere*'s core was,
it would still instantly report that to the Marines
who doubled as Halley's police.
But with each passing season,
as the *Guinevere* slowly fell apart beneath them despite Iffy's hard work,
his one-sided discussions of big deals and "if only"
had turned into angry tirades and sullen silences.
Iffy didn't know where she would go,
and she couldn't bear the thought of leaving Aunt Naggie to face him alone,
but she knew that one day soon she was going to walk down the gangplank
and never come back.

One day—but not today.

The *Guinevere*'s galley wasn't big enough for two people to do anything side by side
except get in each other's way,
so Iffy sat at its little fold-down table
and watched Aunt Naggie work with the efficiency of long practice.
Within minutes,
two thinly-sliced onions sizzled in a battered ceramic frying pan
while a pot of desalinated water came to the boil.
A handful of diced mushrooms and a splash of soy sauce joined the onions,
filling the air with a rich aroma that tightened the knot in Iffy's stomach.

The knot turned into an ache as Aunt Naggie added some of her precious spices.
"Is that Mrs. Sandhu's curry?" Iffy asked,
turning a pair of chopsticks over and over in her hands.

"Mm hm."
Aunt Naggie fished the little jar out of her apron,
sprinkled a little into the simmering mixture,
then tucked the little jar at the back of her spice shelf.
"I save it for special occasions."
She dropped a thick handful of noodles into the pot,
glanced at her foster daughter,
and added a few more.

Iffy put the chopstick back on the table.
"What's so special 'bout today?" she grumbled.

Aunt Naggie smiled without looking up from her cooking.
"Any time I cook for just th' two of us is special," she said fondly,
knocking bits of onion off her spatula into the frying pan.
"But best we don't mention that to Jack, aright?"

"Sure," Iffy said,
feeling a knot in her chest to match the one in her stomach.
She stood up and hugged Aunt Naggie from behind.
"You know I won't leave you, aye?"

Her foster mother's shoulders slumped slightly.
She moved the frying pan off the induction loop
and turned around to wrap her arms around the skinny young woman
who had somehow replaced the skinny little girl
she had once sung bedtime songs to.
"I love you too, *cho*," she said,
kissing Iffy's shaved head.
"But when your chance comes, you take it, aright?"
She squeezed Iffy.
"Now, scootch over."

A few minutes later Iffy sat down on deck
with her back against the wheelhouse door
and a steaming bowl of noodles in her lap.
She bowed her head and said a brief prayer for the olders she could barely remember,
then began scooping noodles into her mouth.
Not even the sound of her uncle grumbling belowdecks
could spoil the spicy sweet taste in her mouth
or the feeling of the knot in her belly slowly relaxing.

When the noodles were gone
she wiped the last drops of sauce out of the bowl with her thumb
and licked it.
The faint tang of machinery from her unwashed hand barely registered.
She sighed.
She would like nothing better than to close her eyes and let the summer sun warm her face,
but the backstay cable *did* need mending,
and it wasn't as if the engine was going to put itself back together—not
on a ship as simple-minded as the *Guinevere*.

She patted her coat
to check that the reciprocating rod was still in her pocket
and hauled herself to her feet.
Down at the base of the pier,
one of the barnacle farmers was balancing a pole across her shoulders
with a large bucket dangling on each end.
The other had stacked the smaller buckets on a two-wheeled cart
and was gently lowering their precious sheets of plastic back into the sea.
They would haul in on the next pier tomorrow,
then the next and the next
until their circuit brought them back to where they had started.
They had been doing it since before Iffy was born.
It kept them fed,
but little more,
and Iffy would be damned and drowned before she would let anything like that become her life.

Without warning a sketch materialized somewhere between her eyes and her brain.
Two toothed wheels to reel in the strips of plastic,
a sharp-edged scraper to pry the barnacles off,
a lens connected to a tiny core set just so in a wire frame
to steer the scraper so that it didn't dig into the plastic…
The whole thing would only cost a couple of rand to make,
and would save the old women an hour or two every day.
Mister Mishra had everything except the frame,
and she could literally see how to print that.
She could actually make it,
she realized with mounting excitement.
She could make it and sell it to the barnacle farmers and—

*BOOM!*
The explosion sounded like someone slamming the world's biggest box down on the world's biggest table.
A roiling mass of smoke billowed up into the sky on the edge of town.
"Oh shad!" Iffy gasped.
It was the new machine shop!

A siren wailed.
Others joined it.
She heard Uncle Jack bellow,
"What'n hole you done now, girl?"
but she was already racing down the gangplank.

By the time she reached the machine shop
a small crowd had gathered on the paved turnaround in front of it.
Something like panic rose in her throat
when she saw that the explosion hadn't been in the building itself
but in the squat blockhouse beside it
where the industrial printer was sitting in quarantine.

One corner of the blockhouse had collapsed
into a tangle of masonry chunks and twisted foam steel beams.
A rough-looking woman in a green and yellow vest
stood in front of its single door
arguing loudly with two men in dark blue Marine uniforms.
"An *I* said I'll open it when my captain tells me to!"
she said hotly,
uncrossing muscular arms thick with tattoos
and the silver tracery of tech.

Two more Marines pushed through the crowd,
sidekick drones whining faintly over their heads.
One of them pointed at the sergeant's stripes on his sleeve.
"Do you see these, citizen?" he demanded.
"These indicate that I have authority to direct action
as I think most consistent with regulations regarding general public safety.
We will therefore proceed to inspect this site regardless of your wishes."

The woman's lip curled.
"Consistent wi regulations, is it?" she mimicked.
"Well that means nothin' to me, mate,
so you an' your brainmush friends can—oy!"
She stepped sideways to block a second Marine
as he moved toward the door.

"Clear away! Clear away, all o' you!"
The crowded parted hastily at the shouted order.
Half a dozen sailors pushed through the crowd.
All of them wore variations on the woman's yellow-and-green vest
with *Taroona* stencilled on the back.
"Uh oh," someone near Iffy muttered.

The shaven-headed woman leading the new arrivals put her hands on her hips.
"Y'arra, Bags?" she asked,
glaring at the Marine sergeant, the crowd, and everything else in sight for good measure.

"Kappa, cap'n," the first woman growled.
"Just 'splainin' t' these lot that there ain't nothin' here needs their look-in."

"With respect, citizen," the sergeant said,
his inducted accent making his calm words ridiculous and ominous at the same time,
"Any potential danger to the residents or property of Halley
is a proper subject of our attention.
Particularly anything that might turn our beloved city into another Bharati,"
he added in something more like a normal voice.

The crowd murmured.
Twenty years before,
someone's home-brew tech had gone up in flames in Bharati.
Dozens had died as fire swept through the small town,
and dozens more from exposure in the days that followed.
Iffy had never asked Mister Mishra about that night,
but every year,
on the anniversary,
he and Little Mrs. Sandhu and their friends gathered at the end of the longest pier in town
to toss handfuls of precious flowers into the sea.

The *Taroona*'s crew ignored the mutters of "Too right" and "Just let 'em look"
from the crowd.
One sailor hefted a gaff hook.
Another wrapped a length of chain around her hand
as the twin or clone beside her revved the motors in her shoulders.
"Well this ain't Bharati,"
the *Taroona*'s captain said to the sergeant.
"Contract says we're to mind everythin' we hauled down from Taz
'til Halley core tells us otherways,
so whatever happened here is on us t' fix."

The sergeant looked at the debris on the ground.
"Do you regard this as 'taking care', citizen?" has asked pointedly.
The crowd murmured again.

The *Taroona*'s captain crossed her arms.
"That ain't our doin'," she said firmly.
"Printer don't have any feedstock, not yet.
Couldna made a marble, much less a bomb."
She looked up at the drones circling overhead.
"So *I* think this was someone messin' around tryin' t' do us outta bein' paid,"
she said loudly to the city core's eyes and ears.

"I find your diagnosis comforting," the sergeant said.
"But I still insist on inspecting this site directly."
In one choreographed motion,
he and the three Marines beside him
drew their shock sticks from the holsters on their hips.

"Oh shad," someone said quietly beside Iffy.
"It's gonna be a jammer."

Iffy gulped.
She had never seen a fight worse than teenagers shoving each other,
but Uncle Jack had been in several over the years.
The last time they were in Rothera
he had come back to the *Guinevere* bruised and bloodied
and uncharacteristically quiet about what had happened.
As the Marines' uniform jackets hardened into armor,
she turned to find somewhere safer to be.

And bumped into Johnson Wales.
"'Scuse me," she muttered before she realized who he was.

"No worries," he said pleasantly.
"I was actually just leaving myself.
Here—could you give me a hand?"
Without waiting for an answer
he handed her a bulky black box with a flip-up handle on its lid
and stooped to pick up its two identical twins.

"What—?" Iffy started to ask.

"Ssh!" Wales cut her off and looked up at the Marines' sidekick drones circling overhead.
Without warning their buzzing stopped.
They dropped out of the sky like rocks.

"Oy, that weren't us!" the *Taroona*'s captain protested,
but it was too late.
As the drones clattered on the cobblestones,
the sergeant blew his whistle.
Moving as one,
the squad charged the sailors in front of them.

A shock stick sizzled and cracked.
Someone shouted an obscenity,
and suddenly people were running past Iffy
as the sailors and Marines did what sailors and Marines have been doing
for as long as there have been sailors and Marines.

"Come on," Wales urged Iffy.
She hurried after him,
the toolbox bumping against her leg.

"Oy!" a voice shouted.
"You there! Where th' hole d'you think you're goin'?"
A rangy man in a yellow-and-green vest with a half-star tattooed on his face
shoved a couple of people out of his way and grabbed Iffy by the arm.

And there it was in her head,
like a wireframe of a machine labelled with angles and velocities.
Before she even realized what she was doing she spun around,
swinging the toolbox in a sharp arc.
Its rising edge hit the *Taroona* crewman beneath his knee with a crack.

"Aargh! Shaddin' hack, ya wheezy—"
The toolbox in Wales' right hand thudded against the side of sailor's head.
He collapsed to the cobblestones in a heap.

"Run!"
Wales urged as two of the *Taroona*'s crew spotted their fallen comrade
and began shoving their way through the panic to even the score.

Iffy ran,
or tried to,
but the toolbox was heavy and awkward
and the women chasing her were half again her height
and they could knock people aside instead of going around them
or pushing in between them and what had just happened?
How could she have *seen* what she needed to do?

Just as a voice yelled, "Gotcha!" another shouted "*Gardez-vous!*"
Iffy yelped as a familiar rust-stained centipede reared up in front of her.
The sailor behind her skidded to a halt on the cobblestones
and was knocked sprawling as her partner slammed into her from behind.

"Mad bot! Mad bot!"
the second sailor shouted,
dodging back as French Henry clacked a manipulator at her.

"Come on!"
Wales pulled her into the scatter of people.

For a few moments all Iffy could do was try not to stumble and fall.
Just when she couldn't hold onto the toolbox any longer
Wales pulled her into a side alley.
A few drops of sweat glistened on his forehead.
"Are you all right?" he panted.

Iffy dropped the toolbox on the ground and doubled over to catch her breath.
"No, I'm not aright," she wheezed.
"I just about got my chomper clocked back there!
And what's this?"
She whacked the toolbox with the toe of her boot,
something between a prod and a kick.
"This what the *Taroona* bikkies upped from you?"

Wales nodded.
"Everything that matters."
Tiny lights danced briefly across the silvery rectangles in his temples.
He looked up as an angry drone buzzed overhead.
Another followed it a moment later.
"Come on.
The Marines have called for reinforcements—we should be somewhere else when they arrive."

Wales led her out the other end of the alley
onto a narrow street lined with two-story houses made of laser-cut stones.
Blue-green moss that had escaped from some lab traced their mortared joints.
It was strangely quiet after the commotion on the street—the only sounds were the gulls,
the faint hum of a heavy drone passing nearby,
and their boots on the cobblestones.

Iffy struggled to keep up with Wales
as he strode confidently toward the center of town.
The sailors and townsfolk she knew ranged from lean to stringy—cold weather
and the sparse Antarctic diet didn't give bodies much chance to put on weight.
Wales' broad shoulders made him look boxy by comparison,
and the toolboxes seemed much smaller in his hands than in hers.

"Hang up a jif," Iffy finally said.
Wales stopped as she set her load down on the ground and caught her breath.
Between the Marines' inducted fighting skills,
their drones,
and their armor,
the *Taroona*'s sailors would have had about as much chance
as a snowball in Aunt Naggie's frying pan.
"Sometimes people fight just so they can tell themselves they did,"
Aunt Naggie had explained after one of Uncle Jack's misadventures.
"Sometimes tryin' is the only kind of winnin' you can hope for."

"*Mon ami! Mon ami!*"
She jumped and squawked as French Henry suddenly rattled around the corner,
its dented old optics swinging from side to side.
The fixit bot skittered to a halt a few meters away.
"*Ça va bien!*" it announced proudly.
"*Ça va tres bien!*"

"What's it sayin'?" Iffy whispered loudly,
unconsciously backing up a step.
Halley tolerated free bots because they needed their labor,
but there were too many stories of machines driven mad by malware left over from the war
for people to ever truly be comfortable around something as big as French Henry.

Wales didn't seem bothered in the least.
"*Merci beaucoup, mon vieux.*"
He reached into a pocket inside his jacket
and withdrew something that looked like a miniature gray waffle.
"*Ici. C'est à vous.*"

A hatch on the fixit bot's front panel popped open.
A slender manipulator as long as Iffy's arm unfolded
to pluck the object from in Wales' hand.
It was a heat exchanger,
Iffy realized,
a tiny sibling of one that Mister Mishra had been repairing
the last time the *Guinevere* was in dock.

A blueprint materialized in her head.
The heat exchanger belonged *there*,
in the housing around the fixit bot's tiny quantum core.
Except it hadn't actually been designed to do maintenance.
It was an infiltrator designed to worm its way through sewers and outflow pipes.
Half its parts had been replaced by mis-matched odds and ends taken from other bots
or hacked together out of scrap metal where the tech to make the originals had been lost,
but its original design was still there beneath the patchwork.

Her vision disappeared
as French Henry's slender manipulator folded back into its housing.
"*Merci beaucoup,*" it said,
rocking back and forth in what might have been the mechanical equivalent of a dog wagging its tail
before grinding its gears and rolling away toward the docks
saying, "*Gardez-vous! Gardez-vous!*" once more.

"What was *that* all about?"
Iffy demanded as Wales closed the lid on his toolbox and picked it up.

Wales shrugged.
"Just a hard-to-find part to help an old friend," he said,
sounding fond and sad at the same time
as the bot disappear around the corner.
"Come on—we should get going."

"Uh huh.
Must be pretty affin' special for it to take a chance on bein' scrapped
for scarin' people like it did back there."
When Wales didn't answer she nudged the toolbox next to her with her boot.
"So was that you? The 'splosion back there?"

Wales blinked.
"Why on earth would you think that was me?"

Iffy rolled her eyes.
"Cuz they upped your gear an' then the blockhouse blew up
an' then the bot that takes care o' the town's sewers an' all
just happens t' be a friend o' yours
an' now you got your stuff back?
I ain't *stupid*," she finished disgustedly.
Why did grownups always think kids were stupid?

"No you're not," Wales agreed thoughtfully.
He nodded at the toolbox next to her feet.
"Are you okay to carry that a bit further?"

Iffy crossed her arms in unconscious imitation of the *Taroona*'s captain
and raised an eyebrow.

Wales smiled briefly.
"Sorry.
Arra kappa t' carry at down s'far we go long?"

Iffy made a face.
"That was *terrible*," she judged witheringly.
"And sure, but only if I get t'see what's in it."

Wales chuckled.
"Fair enough. Come on."
He glanced up as one last drone zipped past overhead.
Lights sparkled briefly in the rectangle set into his temple,
making Iffy wonder how honestly the drones were reporting the scene
to Halley's central core.

They picked up their loads and walked side by side
behind the Sandhu's grocery
to the café where Wales had rented a room.
The owner glanced from Wales to Iffy to the toolboxes
but said nothing more than, "Tea?"

They sat at the café's single stone-topped table
and sipped the strong, minty brew from mis-matched ceramic mugs the size of Iffy's doubled fists.
Wales sighed contentedly,
then set his mug aside and opened the toolbox Iffy had been carrying.
"Whoa," Iffy breathed.

Some of the tools looked as good as new,
though they had to be at least a hundred years old—only
a handful of well-defended factories scattered around the world
still had the cleanrooms and nano-fabricators needed
to create marvels like the fractal iridium mesh that
Wales briefly let her inspect
through a monocle made from a single perfectly-formed diamond.
Other tools were clearly cobbled together
from whatever spare parts Wales had been able to find.
Iffy felt more comfortable with these,
since pretty much everything in Halley was built the same way.

"An' what about those?" she asked eagerly,
pointing at a nested set of asymmetric gears
as Wales carefully repacked everything.

The square man chuckled.
"Let's save them for another time."
He blinked as the lights in his temples flickered.
"The town says the Marines have resolved the situation by the quarantine shed—the
explosion was apparently a result of faulty maintenance
on an outflow pipe that hadn't been registered in the town plans.
Oh,
and the disturbance involving the crew of an unnamed Australian vessel
has been addressed."

Iffy snorted.
"Faulty maintenance my orphaned arse.
I know that was you."

Wales blinked at her innocently.
"I'm sure I have no idea what you mean."

"Uh huh."
Iffy glanced at the clock painted on café wall.
"Oh crivens," she swore,
scrambling to her feet.
She'd been gone nearly half an hour—Aunt Naggie would be worried sick,
and Uncle Jack would be furious.

"Hold on," Wales said, patting the air.
"Just a minute, I promise."
He gulped another mouthful of tea and sat back in his chair.
"Tell me more about this ship of yours…"

Wales locked his toolboxes in his room before they left
and put a small toy bear with bright blue eyes on the shelf above them.
"To keep an eye on things,"
he said,
tapping the tech in his temple.
Iffy nodded—smart toys were an everyday thing,
even for someone who had grown up as poor as she had.
She didn't know what the orange-and-red globe of Mars next to the bear was for,
but she suspected it would do more than just watch if someone broke in.

A pair of bulky gray drones hovered over the harbor
as Iffy and Wales walked down to the pier.
"Keeping an eye on the *Taroona*," Wales guessed,
shielding his eyes with his hand to study them.
"Those forks on the front are ultrasonic pulse guns.
One blast from them and you'll have a headache for a week.
And the nozzles behind them probably spray strangle foam."

"Why are they just watchin'?" Iffy asked.
"Why don't th' Marines just haul everyone in for th' governors to sort out?"

Wales sighed.
"Politics.
Even if they *did* blow up the quarantine building,
the *Taroona* and the rest of the Australian fleet
are the only thing stopping the Brazilians from walking in here.
Odds are the captain and her crew will be back on the dock by morning,"
he continued,
speaking to himself as much as to the frowning tween beside him.
"Which is another reason I need to talk to your uncle."

"Y'oughta know he don't keep his word 'less it suits him,"
Iffy warned.
"Or 'less he figures you got some serious haul back o' you."

Wales nodded.
"Thank you—I'll keep that in mind."

Ten minutes later Uncle Jack shouted,
"No affin' way!
We're a jelly dredger,
not an affin' ferryboat!
You wanna hitch up along Rothera,
get yourself three piers over an' buy a ticket."

Wales' polite expression didn't waver.
"I understand it's not your usual line of work," he said smoothly
when the *Guinevere*'s bleary-eyed captain paused for breath.
"And if no is your final answer,
I'll respect that and take my business elsewhere.
But!"
He held up a hand to forestall another outburst.
"What if I could do more than just pay for my passage?"

Uncle Jack snorted.
He had been dozing when Iffy and Wales reached the *Guinevere*,
and from his squint and the smell of his breath Iffy guessed that
she'd find at least one empty bottle in the recycling
if she bothered to look for it.
"Lemme guess—you can sing.
Or no—you can do magic tricks an' turn jellyfish into gold."

"Almost," Wales nodded.
"Except it isn't magic, and gold will be all yours."
He tapped the tech in his temple.
"This is a satellite uplink.
A *fully functional* satellite uplink,"
he continued as Uncle Jack opened his mouth.
"Which means I can spot patches of sea boil with half an hour to spare.
Maybe a full hour, if a satellite is in the right positions.
And *that* means—"

Uncle Jack said a word that sent Aunt Naggie's hands flying to her mouth.
"Ain't no such thing," the *Guinevere*'s captain sneered.
"Not since the war—everyone knows that.
The sats are all 'crypted an' th' keys are long gone."

"They are indeed encrypted," Wales nodded.
"But as for the keys…"
He closed his eyes.
"Your beacon is GUIN40782, is that right?"
He nodded to himself without waiting for an answer.
"Your last trip, you were at sea nine days.
You spent most of it over the Berkner Rise."

"So what?" Uncle Jack contemptuously.
"Everyone 'round here dredges th' Berk."

"Some with more luck than others," Wales observed coolly.
"Take the *Whitstable*, for example.
The jellyfish they brought back came up in a boil
just twenty kay northeast of you.
If you'd known it was happening,
they could have been yours."

Uncle Jack scowled.
The *Whitstable* was tied up two piers away,
her captain overseeing a refit
paid for by the hold full of jellyfish she had brought back to Halley
the day after the *Guinevere* had returned.
Her crew had been celebrating their good fortune in Halley's shops and bars ever since.

Uncle Jack scratched his cheek through his uncombed beard.
Iffy could practically hear him resenting the other ship's good luck.
"You're shaddin' me," he growled.
"There's no way you could know somethin' like that 'fore it happened."

Wales didn't answer.
Instead,
he closed his eyes again and pointed toward the *Guinevere*'s stern.
"There's a pair of Aussie freighters a hundred and forty kay that way,
core pilots and human crews,
carrying…"
He paused.
"Profile looks like grain,
but they have something heavier for ballast.
Smuggling in machinery to swap for coal, most likely."
He pivoted twenty degrees like a weathervane.
"The *Peacock*, the *Reculver*, and the *Watney Breach* are dredging together.
They're not going to find much—the sea bottom there
might as well be concrete."
He pivoted again.
"And there's a Brazilian catamaran out that way,
three hundred kay and bearing northwest."
He smiled slightly.
"She looks like an old lady dressed up for church."

He turned back toward them and opened his eyes.
"I can get all of it,"
he said in a voice that left no room for doubt or disagreement.
"Every image, every signal.
And I need to get to Rothera.
The only question is, will that be your good fortune or someone else's?"

Uncle Jack hefted his gaff hook.
"Jack," Aunt Naggie began.

"Quiet," he snapped, greed and mistrust warring on his face.
"We keep whatever we haul," he finally said.
"An' th' moment we tie up,
you're off an' I never heard o' you."

"Fair enough," Wales agreed.
He stuck out his hand.

Iffy held her breath.
Uncle Jack scowled a moment longer,
then grabbed it and gave it a single perfunctory shake.
"I'm guessin' you'll want t' be off right away," he said sourly.

Wales nodded.
"Just as soon as I collect my—"
He froze.

"What?" Uncle Jack demanded.
Wales raised a hand for silence, his eyes half-closed.

"Oh no," Uncle Jack blustered,
drawing himself up to his full height.
"You don't shush me on my ship, not less you want to—"

"Someone is breaking into my room."
Wales' good humor had vanished.
"Warm up the engines and get ready to cast off.
I'll be back in ten minutes."

"We'll cast off when *I* say!"
Uncle Jack said angrily.

Iffy's heart sank.
Telling Uncle Jack what to do *always* made him do the opposite.

But her uncle's anger had no more effect on Wales
than a windstorm would on a mountain.
"Here."
He pulled a money out of his jacket and thrust it at Uncle Jack.
"A down payment."

Uncle Jack turned the flat plastic rectangle over in his hands suspiciously.
"What's it worth?"

"Six thousand rand," Wales said.

"Six *thousand*?"
Uncle Jack pressed his thumb on the corner of the money.
His eyes widened at the blinking figures it displayed,
then narrowed again as he looked Wales up and down.
"You must wanna get outta here pretty badly,"
he mused.

"It's no use to me if I can't spend it,"
Wales said crisply.
"Do we still have a deal?"

Uncle Jack pocketed the card and grunted something unintelligible.
"Thank you," Wales said. "I'll be quick."
He turned to go, then stopped himself.
"Just so you know, this is still switched on."
He tapped the tech in his temple.
"So if you try to call the Marines, I'll know."

Uncle Jack spat over the taffrail.
"Ain't nobody here calls th' Blues," he growled.

"And none of your business associates either, please,"
Wales added coolly.
"Or I'll send the Marines to call on *them*
and make it look like you did."

Before Uncle Jack could reply Wales strode down the gangplank,
lengthening his stride into a jog
that carried him along the pier and into town.
"That one's trouble," Uncle Jack said flatly.
He leaned his elbows on the taffrail,
cleared his throat,
and spat again into the water below.
There was more gray in his beard than there used to be,
Iffy thought,
and the three-day fuzz on his shaved scalp
had crept further and further away from his forehead.

Uncle Jack noticed her looking at him.
"Well, get movin'!" he barked,
straightening up.
"You too, woman," he added to Aunt Naggie.
"I want us away from whatever's chasin' him soon as he's back."
He strode away,
muttering to himself.

Aunt Naggie and Iffy whooshed out their breath at the same time.
"You gonna tell me what's goin' on?" Aunt Naggie asked.

Iffy shrugged helplessly.
"I dunno, auntie, true I don't.
There was a fight up along by quarantine,
an' French Henry got into it, and…"
*And all of a sudden I know how to tag someone twice my size,*
she almost added but didn't.
Bots weren't the only ones infected with malware during the war,
and talking about her visions with anyone—even Aunt Naggie—would mean admitting
there was something in her head that shouldn't be.

But something in her expression caught Aunt Naggie's eye.
She put her hand on Iffy's forehead.
"Just be still," she shushed,
stern and worried at the same time.
After a moment she took her hand away,
but her expression didn't change.
"There's no fever.
How about you start gettin' us ready an' I'll make us something quick to eat?"

"Tea'd be nice," Iffy said gratefully.

It normally took a full day to get the *Guinevere* ready to sail,
but the money in Uncle Jack's pocket seemed to make him believe it could be done in a blink.
He roared at Iffy and Aunt Naggie to move their sorry sterns,
and no,
don't worry about tyin' that down,
they could take care of it once they were at sea,
just put it somewhere for now and get the affin' engine goin!

It took Iffy five minutes of careful work to put the reciprocating rod back in place.
Five more minutes and the engine was chugging away,
biofuel gurgling through kinks in the feed pipe
that she had never been able to get rid of.
She would normally have checked the winch motor
to make sure they could haul in whatever they caught,
but there wasn't time,
so she laced some straps around the fine mesh dredging nets
to stop them shifting or tangling in high seas.
Wait—the fuel hose!
It was still connected to the pump on the pier.
If they had set sail without undoing it,
it would have snapped like an overstretched rubber band.
She had seen that happen once.
It had sounded like a gunshot,
and the end had torn open an unlucky sailor's cheek.

She scrambled up the ladder that connected the engine room to the deck.
"Ready here," she called.

Aunt Naggie coiled the last stayline and shoved it into a canvas bag,
then shoved the bag into a bench locker and dogged the seat-lid shut.
"That's all for me too."
She handed Iffy half a sandwich—curried egg with more of Mrs. Sandhu's spice mix—and
waited ten seconds for her foster daughter to wolf it down
before thumping the cabin wall with her fist.
"Good when you are," she shouted,
confident as she always was when something needed to be done.

The cabin door flew open.
Uncle Jack stepped out onto deck,
glaring at his wife and foster daughter on principle.
"That's what I said," he told the empty air impatiently.
"Six thousand rand.
I'll have it in a week.
What?
Never you mind how, but that'll more'n put us square.
Right.
Aright.
What?
No, you affin' well better *not* tell her,
or she'll take your skin off an' mine too!
Right.
Aright.
*Vi da*."
He blinked twice to end the call and bared his teeth.

"Who was that?" Aunt Naggie asked cautiously.

Uncle Jack's self-satisfied smile vanished.
"Ne'er you mind," he said brusquely.
"Everythin' stowed?"

"Everythin' that's gonna be," Aunt Naggie said.
"But Jack—"

"I said, ne'er mind!"
He slapped the taffrail with his hand.
"Now where's our high-top troublemaker?"

Five minutes crawled by,
each one tenser than the last,
until Wales appeared at the end of the pier.
One toolbox hung from each hand.
The third was slung over his shoulder on a strap,
and he had a small travelling pack on his back.

Iffy scurried down the gangplank and ran to him.
"Thank you,"
Wales said gratefully
as she took one of the boxes from his hand.

"No worries," Iffy replied.
Then she gasped.
"You're bleeding!"

"Still?"
Wales pulled a rag out of his pocket,
dabbed at his nose,
and studied the red blotch a moment.
"So I am."
He put the rag back in his pocket and began limping toward the *Guinevere*.

"What happened?"
Iffy puffed as she fell into step beside him.
"Was someone really tryin' t' break into your room?
Were they along from the *Taroona*?
Did you get punched up?
An' what's wrong with your leg?"

"Oh, everything was mostly sorted out by the time I got there,"
Wales said vaguely.
"And my leg's bothered me for years.
I keep meaning to get it looked at,
but I never seem to have time.
There's just never enough time," he repeated.

Uncle Jack didn't wait for Wales to stow his belongings
before hauling in the gangplank and casting off.
The engine rumbled and coughed for a moment
as they pulled away from the pier,
then settled into the steady thumping that was as familiar to Iffy as her own breathing.

They were halfway across the harbor
when a klaxon blared *brrrap! brrrap!*
Iffy ran to the stern in time to see
a flock of drones converge on a pier halfway around the harbor
from where the *Guinevere* had been berthed.

A single ship lay alongside the pier,
long and low and gray and dangerous—the *Taroona*.
Iffy shaded her eyes with her hand.
The ship looked like it was casting off,
but no,
a pair of Marine cutters had boxed her in
and a platoon of figures in blue were trotting toward the pier.
She glanced at Wales,
wondering if this was somehow his doing,
but the American's eyes were on the horizon.

They rounded the broken-backed carrier that was Halley's seawall a few minutes later.
The swell beneath them instantly grew stronger.
Uncle Jack took the first watch,
grumbling that if they were hauled in by the Marines
everyone should just let him do the talking.
Aunt Naggie said she would take the second watch,
then shooed Iffy off to sleep.
"You can talk to Mister Johnson in the morning,"
she said firmly.
"Let him have his rest now."
Then she smiled the way she only did
when she and foster daughter were alone together.
"You'll need some too
if you're gonna go chattin' up that special friend o' yours."

"Honesty ain't special!" Iffy protested automatically.
Still smiling,
her foster mother pulled her into a hug and kissed the shaven top of her head,
then gently pulled the door of the storage locker closed behind her.

Iffy pulled her nature book out of her mattress
and lay on her stomach to page through it.
The orca, the tiger, the gorilla…
She ran her fingers over the pictures,
sounding out the handwritten comments beside them.
*Mom took us to see the baby giraffes today,* said one.
*There are three of them.
They are all clones and they live in a big dome because of the virus.
Mom says they have been tweaked to be immune to it.*
And then,
in an older version of the same hand,
*Turns out they weren't.
Mom says there isn't money to try again,
so I guess that's it for giraffes.*
And then there was a sad cartoon face,
one of several scattered through the book.

Iffy browsed the other animals,
wondering what it would have been like to live in a world
that still had so many different kinds of creatures.
She stubbornly tried to keep her eyelids from closing
until she couldn't remember why they shouldn't.
When she finally dozed, she dreamed.

*She was on deck.
The sky was a perfect blue,
and her olders were stuffing her into her ecosuit.
"Just in case, love," Second said, forcing a smile.*

*But when the ship's horn blared it wasn't a horn at all
but the sound of a drill press.
She was in Mister Mishra's,
fumbling clumsily to reassemble a mound of chips and gears and actuators
that she had never seen before.
Her heart raced as she tried to piece them together.
This rod into that socket—no,
that couldn't be right,
it turned the wrong way and didn't leave enough space for the lens,
because the lens had to go there,
it had to,
she didn't know how she knew but she did and time was running out.*

*And then suddenly she could see the whole design
from the overall schematic
down to the bevelled teeth of the microscopic gears
that would catch and grind on specks of dust too small to see or feel
if they weren't assembled just so in airtight diamond cases.
There and there,
that's where the hair-fine optical fibers had to go,
and there,
right in the machine's heart,
was the space where a miniaturized core could—*

*The whole room heeled hard, throwing her to the floor.
"She's gonna blow!" Mister Mishra shouted,
and then all Iffy could hear was a rushing sound
as the ship fell away beneath her into a pit of churning foam.*

She woke up drenched in sweat.
Hugging her pillow to her chest,
she buried her face in her mattress to muffle her sobs.
When they finally ran down she wiped her nose angrily on her sleeve,
rolled over on her back,
and fumbled on the floor beside her for her water bottle
before remembering that she hadn't refilled it.
"Idiot," she muttered,
thumping her fist against her mattress.

It took her a long time to fall asleep again.

## Chapter 3

It was four days to Rothera across the Weddell Sea.
Once upon a time their route would have been blocked by a solid sheet of ice.
During the Melt they would have had to thread a path between cakes and bergs,
but those days were long gone too.
There was nothing between them and their destination except
bits of floating plastic,
the inevitable seagulls,
and the waves.

After motoring for an hour under thin, high clouds,
Uncle Jack ordered the *Guinevere* to raise her sails.
The ship's tiny core obediently ran mis-matched gossamer sheets up her twin Y-masts.
Waves a meter high made the *Guinevere* rock from side to side in a rhythm
that Iffy knew as well as she knew her own heartbeat.
By the time she woke up and wriggled back into her clothes,
Halley had fallen below the horizon.

"Best stay outta his way," Aunt Naggie advised
when her foster daughter clambered down into the galley to get tea.
"He ain't used t' havin' folk on board, but I 'spect he'll settle in."
It sounded more like a prayer than a prediction,
but Iffy nodded and climbed back on deck
with a chipped ceramic mug in her hand.

"'Bout affin' time," her uncle said sharply
when she knocked on the door of the pilot house
and handed him the mug.
He slurped a mouthful and set it in the ring next to the ship's wheel.

Iffy glanced at the control panel.
Tiny cameras dotted about the ship showed the engine,
the hold,
the sails,
and practically everywhere else on the ship
except the insides of the cabins and the tiny toilet near the stern.
Small graphs scattered among the images told her at a glance
how much fuel they had,
how much tension was in the forestays and mainstays,
and what the wind and the currents around them were doing.

The most important display was the sonar.
Every captain kept a close eye on that if they wanted to make it home.
At the first sign of gas bubbling up from the ocean floor,
they would fire up the engine and run.

Uncle Jack jerked a thumb at a panel highlighted in orange.
"You get that backstay cable mended soonish if you want lunch,"
he growled.

"Yessir," Iffy said obediently.
He'd been drinking again, she realized.
She could smell it on his breath,
and from the way he clutched the wheel to hold himself steady
she guessed he'd been at it for a while.

"An' see if that baggage o' yours wants t' make himself useful as well,"
Uncle Jack added as she turned to go.
"Or better yet, just tell 'im I told him to!"

Wales had reorganized the ship's other storage locker while Iffy was asleep
to make room for his pack and toolboxes.
He was seated on a thwart at the *Guinevere*'s stern,
seemingly lost in thought as Iffy approached him,
but said, "Of course," in reply to Iffy's tentative request for help.
Standing,
he straightened his jacket and smiled.
"Being useful would be good for me right now."

"You thinkin' bout them off th' *Taroona*?
Not that it's any o my look-in,"
she added hastily.

Wales shook his head.
"No,
I was thinking about the *Landrieu*.
The big ship back at Halley,"
he continued as Iffy gave him a blank look.
"The one the town uses as a breakwater.
She was a marvel in her time.
Fractal carbon ribs,
a foamed poly-composite hull,
and a core smart enough to qualify for citizenship.
She was the first of her kind to solo the Pacific,
but then the war came, and…"
He sighed.
"It must have broken her heart to run herself aground."

"I guess," Iffy said to fill the silence that followed.
"Can't imagine how I'd feel if somethin' like that happened to th' *Ginny*.
Or to me,"
she added after a moment's thought.

Wales shook his head to clear it.
"Let's hope you never have to find out," he said,
suddenly brisk.
"Now, where's this cable we're supposed to splice?"

Iffy had hoped that Wales would bring out his toolboxes—she
was itching to examine their contents in detail—but instead,
he studied the hacked-off ends of the backstay cable
with a hand-held smart lens
that highlighted the worse of the damage in garish reds and yellows.
Iffy wanted to tell him that the damage wasn't her fault,
but she bit back her words.
There was no way she could say that without pointing the finger at Uncle Jack,
and as much as she wanted him to think well of her as a mechanic,
no self-respecting sailor would ever cast shade on her captain
in front of a passenger.

"All right," Wales said,
slipping the magnifier back into one of his coat's many pockets.
"What's the plan—splice, clamp, strap, or weld?"

"I was thinkin' I could splice it?" Iffy ventured hesitantly.
When Wales nodded
she fished a roll of twisted eight-gauge cable from her bag of odds and ends
and dug around to find a wire cutter and a pair of needle-nosed pliers.

The next half hour flew by as Iffy lost herself in the task at hand.
She had expected Wales to take charge,
but instead he asked one question after another,
drawing ideas out of her that she hadn't know were there.
It was like the schematics that sometimes popped into her head
but without the gut chill of not knowing where they came from.

Once the first dozen lengths of splice were woven into the cable
Wales sat cross-legged on the deck and held the ends together
so that Iffy could finish connecting them.
She worked as quickly as she could,
waiting for him to say it was time for a break,
but he didn't.
*Uncle Jack wouldn't have been able to hold the cable like that,* she thought.
Even Mister Mishra would have struggled after a minute or two,
but Wales seemed unbothered.
She glanced at the silver rectangles in his temples
and wondered what other tech he might have that wasn't so visible.

Over, through, under, through…
"There." She sat back on her haunches.
"Wanna see if it holds together?"

Wales stood,
trapped one end of the cable under his boot,
and pulled hard.
The splice stretched slightly,
and for a moment Iffy was afraid it would give way,
but it held.
"Looks good to me.
Well done."

Iffy shrugged, embarrassed by the praise.
"Only one way t' find out for sure."
She hit the switch on the winch beside her.
The cable zinged as it was wound taut.
Iffy picked up a wrench and whacked the splice a couple of times as hard as she could.

Wales blinked. "Are you always this direct when you're working?"

Iffy grinned. "Pretty much."

There were other things to mend after the cable.
There always were on the *Guinevere*:
a spidery network of microscopic cracks on the forward mast,
a loose coupling on a bilge pipe,
and a handle on the main hatch
that had started sticking mid-way through their last voyage.
Like most of the vessels that called Halley home
the *Guinevere* was constructed from materials that could no longer be made,
only repaired.
Keeping her afloat was a matter of swaps and trades and patches,
of scouring noticeboards in Hell
to find tips that weren't self-replicating spamotage left over from the war,
of swapping messages with other mechanics
trying to keep their own ships running,
and of running simulations to see if this patched with that
would hold together in sub-zero temperatures.
In the end,
though,
it always came down to the combination of clever hands,
brute force,
and improvisation Iffy had used on the cable.
She loved it.

Wales worked beside her the whole time,
handing her tools,
holding things steady while she screwed them in
or used her cherished little laser to put a patch on a weld
that held an even older patch in place.
He somehow managed to keep up a steady stream of questions
without ever making her feel like he was pestering her.
She enjoyed every minute of it,
just like she enjoyed the times
when Mister Mishra turned something she'd made over and over in his hands
and pronounced it well done,
or when Uncle Jack was sound asleep
and Aunt Naggie told her stories about growing up in South Africa
in the years after the war,
when fruit still grew on the trees and people had pets that weren't rats or reptiles or bots.

Wales seemed to enjoy the work as well,
right up until the moment he helped Iffy lift the cover off the backup motor
near the *Guinevere*'s stern.
His face fell at the sight of its compact, soot-stained bulk.
"Y'aright?" Iffy asked,
fanning away the smell.

"I'm fine," Wales said,
gazing down at the filthy ceramic engine block.
"I just thought you ran on jelly render, not coal dust."

"The main engine's a jelly-burner," Iffy said.
"This here is just for when it's bust,
or for haulin' the winches when there's ice 'n' all."

The square-faced man sighed.
"But—coal? Really?"

Iffy's eyes widened.
"Oh crivens—you ain't an Eco, are you?
Uncle Jack'll put you o'er the side an' no mistake.
He hates Ecos even worse'n he hates Zillions."

Wales sighed again.
"No, I'm not an Ecologist.
Or Brazilian, for that matter.
I just…"
He squatted on his haunches
and looked resignedly at the engine.
"Come on. Let's get this done."

He asked fewer questions after that,
but despite his obvious distaste
he clearly knew how coal engines worked.
Half an hour after they started,
the lasers that ignited the coal dust it used for fuel
were sparking and zapping in perfect time
and the cinder clog that had been blocking the intake pipe
had finally been dislodged.
She would normally have let the engine run for a few minutes to test it,
but the thought of Wales not saying anything if she did
made her decide to leave it for later.

Aunt Naggie made noodles for lunch.
The smell of synthetic coconut milk,
greenhouse peppers,
diced mushrooms,
and spices made the galley as warm and as comfortable as an old sweater.
"Just for you," Aunt Naggie whispered to Iffy,
spooning a bit of Mrs. Sandhu's special curry powder into her foster daughter's bowl
when Uncle Jack's back was turned.

Wales thanked Aunt Naggie profusely before taking his up onto deck to eat.
"I like watching the waves," he explained
when she protested that the galley could hold four,
it wouldn't be a problem.

"Foolishness,"
Uncle Jack muttered as soon as Wales was gone,
though whether he meant the idea of trying to squeeze four people around the galley's little table
or the idea of watching waves for pleasure
he didn't say.
He stabbed a chunk of mushroom with a chopstick and stuffed it into his mouth.
"I don't like 'im.
Bet there's more'n just th' *Taroona*'s crew lookin' for 'im, too.
Hell,
I bet someone would pay double what he's givin' us
to know where he's at."
He stabbed another piece of mushroom.

Iffy ate in silence, head down.
The safest thing to do when Uncle Jack got a money-making idea
was to wait for it to pass—pointing out the holes was the surest way to make him actually do it,
just to prove that no one could tell *him* which way was up.
And while she still knew next to nothing about their passenger,
she had the feeling that double-crossing Wales
might actually be the dumbest idea Uncle Jack had ever had.

She and Aunt Naggie cleaned up afterward.
"He seems nice," Aunt Naggie observed
as she scraped the last traces of sauce off a plate into the composter.
"Handy, too."

"Mm hm," Iffy agreed
around one last rubbery noodle.
"Might even be able to talk th' core into bein' a little less stupid
if Uncle Jack'll let him take a crack at it."

"Oh now, wouldn't that be nice?" Aunt Naggie sighed wistfully.
"No more sittin' up in th' middle of th' night
wonderin' if the ship's gonna get a notion to head for Argentina or somethin'."

"But then when would you knit?" Iffy asked,
nudging her foster mother with her elbow.
Aunt Naggie blushed.
Her "knitting" consisted of two balls of yarn,
a pair of needles,
and an endless series of romance sims
featuring dashing Zillion smugglers with smoldering eyes
who didn't realize how empty their lives were until they met the right person,
who was inevitably a poor but honest sailor.
The sims were churned out by a core in Rothera
that had spent the war crafting inspirational propaganda for soldiers and civilians.
Their implausibility and steamy dialogue
only added to the thrill Iffy felt
whenever she managed to get an hour alone with Aunt Naggie's app.

"Never you mind about my knittin'," Aunt Naggie said primly.
"You're on watch tonight,
so you best get a nap an' I'll wake you when."
She kissed the top of her foster daughter's head as Iffy groaned.
"Off with you now."

Wales was back on the thwart at the stern when Iffy got topside,
his empty bowl in his lap.
She hesitated,
wanting to talk but not knowing what to say,
then slipped silently into her converted storage locker.
Taken by a sudden restlessness,
she spent five minutes rearranging her meager possessions
before flopping down on her bed and pulling out her nature book.
The giraffe, the tiger, the wolf with his sad, intelligent eyes…
Someone had written *Looks like Grandad!!!* beside it in tiny curving script.
Iffy had long ago decided that the writer had been a girl about her own age
who had a family and a whole pack of friends.
She closed the book,
tucked it back into her mattress,
and squeezed her eyes shut.

A soft chime in her ear woke her.
She sat up and stretched,
then dug the sleep out of the corners of her eyes.
Her windowless room was completely dark,
but her hands found her clothes on the floor beside her foam slab.
She pulled them on over the onesie she had slept in,
slipped her feet into her boots,
and went out to face another day on the southern ocean.

Aunt Naggie nodded to Iffy when she reached the pilot house.
"Sleep well?"

Iffy yawned and plopped herself onto the stool beside her foster mother.
"Good as. How's she doin'?"
She studied the control panel for a moment.
There was a bit too much tension in the mainsail,
and wind drag over the hull was ten percent higher
than the ship's simple-minded core thought it ought to be,
but that was all normal.
She wondered wistfully what it would be like to have tech in her head
that would let her feel the ship
the way she felt the sun on her face
or the sting of the spray on her skin in a high sea.
She knew it would never happen:
stuff like that had to be implanted at birth
for the brain to learn how to use it.
But she had once paid two carefully-hoarded rand
for five minutes under an induction headset at Halley's midsummer carnival
reliving a glitchy pre-war recording of someone riding a surfboard,
and had fantasized about being the *Guinevere* ever since.

Aunt Naggie nudged her.
"Come about, sleepy head," she chided gently.
Iffy started and straightened.
Her foster mother jerked her chin at the thermos of tea
in the ring holder next to the ship's wheel.
"Fresh made.
Well, fresh-ish," she amended.
"But it'll keep you through a watch."

"Thanks auntie."
Iffy jerked her chin at the panel
as one of the cameras switched views
to show Wales sitting on the thwart at the stern.
"He been there th' whole time?"

"Hasn't budged 'cept to visit th' necessary," Aunt Naggie confirmed.
"Turned on th' sound a while back to ask if he wanted to come an' sit,
but the *Ginny* told me he was talkin' to himself, and…"
She shrugged.
Listening to someone without them knowing was surveillance,
and decent people didn't do that.

"Aright, lemme take over."
Iffy reached past Aunt Naggie
to press her thumb against the dark glass square beside the control panel.
After a moment's hesitation it bleeped and blinked green
to confirm that the ship's core understood a different human was now in charge.

Iffy had scrolled through the core's log many times.
It had been almost sixty years years since it had last been reset
(probably,
she suspected,
because the holds had been full of contraband instead of jellyfish at the time).
Six watches a day while at sea,
with only a couple of weeks a year tied up or idle,
made for almost a hundred and twenty five thousand thumb presses and bleeps.

She had read the highlights
almost as often as she had read her nature book.
Storms, storms, and more storms as the planet warmed up,
some hurling waves taller than the ship's fully-extended mast across the *Guinevere*'s decks.
Births and deaths and shipboard weddings—Aunt Naggie's parents
had invited a dozen friends on board in Rothera to see her exchange vows with a beaming Uncle Jack.
Pirates, twice, and angry notes about dock wardens who wouldn't stay bribed.
"A whale??" followed by "don't be an idiot",
repairs on top of older repairs like layers of barnacles,
and a one-line entry noting that
the sole survivor of a ship lost to a clathrate blow
had been brought on board.

Iffy gave the control panel a protective pat.
"I gotcha, *Ginny*," she whispered.

She watched through the cameras
as Aunt Naggie trudged back to the cabin she shared with her husband of twenty years,
then stared out at the sea.
The endless light of the Antarctic summer
cut sharp reflections into the waves around her.
She toyed with the idea of playing a sim on the ship's core—a sea monster
with tentacles the size of pier posts,
or a war-time training drill
that would send her dodging and weaving through flocks of hostile drones—but
instead she sighed and pulled up some homework.
Her classroom schooling had petered out when she turned ten.
Since then her teachers had been tutoring programs
that she and Aunt Naggie had salvaged, scrounged, or traded for,
each one guarded by security tough enough to keep out generations of teenagers.
If she didn't do at least a little every day,
Aunt Naggie would sigh and look disappointed,
and she'd rather learn anything—even biology—than face that.

That evening, though, the subject was history.
Iffy turned the interaction speed to maximum as the story unfolded.
People burned coal,
then oil,
then coal again even when they knew what it was doing to the world.
Forests were cut down or worn to nothing by drought as the winds shifted…
Fish disappeared as pollution and warming took their toll,
replaced by the jellyfish that now choked the seas…
She skipped over the description of how
warming caused the ancient clathrate ice on the ocean floor to thaw,
sending even more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
She knew all she needed to
about what giant bubbles could do to ships unlucky enough to be above them.

She played half a dozen quick "what if?" sims,
doing worse each time.
Fed up,
she closed her homework
and tapped one of the video squares on the control panel.
"Hey," she said,
her heart in her throat.
"Don't mean t'interrupt, but I got a question if you got th' time."

The tiny image of Wales turned its head.
"You're not interrupting at all," he said,
speaking directly to the pin-sized camera and microphone
set into the taffrail beside him.
"I'm always happy to talk."

A few moments later he knocked on the pilot house door.
"Permission to come aboard?" he asked,
waiting for Iffy to gesture at the stool beside her before seating himself.
He looked around the pilot house appreciatively.
"She's beautiful, isn't she?"

"She's aright," Iffy allowed proudly.
"Still mends her own hull if we give her time,
an the core's mostly holdin' together.
Gotta keep an eye on it, though.
We let it sit too long,
it just stops talkin' to us."

Wales nodded.
"Probably over-cooled.
A lot of people did that to cores when the war started,"
he continued in response to Iffy's questioning look.
"Someone started a rumor that the colder the core was,
the less likely it was to go rogue,
so everyone cranked the nitrogen down almost to the icing point
and then forgot they'd done it.
Have you tried putting a twist coil inside the housing
to rebalance the thermal bleed?"

And as easily as that they slid into a conversation
that leaped from
the relative merits of fractal carbon versus foamed aluminum for masts
to tricks for keeping a drill press lined up and steady
when the building it was in was shaking.
Iffy was just about to ask when that would ever actually be an issue
when he raised a hand to stop her.

"Hang on."
His eyes closed as he communed with the satellite passing overhead,
then snapped open.

"We need to change course," he said,
surging to his feet.
"We need to change course *now*."

"What's wrong?" Iffy asked,
but Wales was already gone.
His boots thumped on the deck as he ran sternward
to bang on the door of Uncle Jack and Aunt Naggie's cabin.

"Captain! Captain, I need to speak with you!"
He waited a second, then pounded on the door again.

"Uh oh," Iffy muttered,
watching on the control panel as the door flew open.

"You better tell me we're sinkin' or I'm puttin' you over the side!
I was *asleep*!"
Uncle Jack bellowed.

"We'll be worse than sinking if we don't change course," Wales said,
tapping the tech in his temple.
"A ship just glitched out of stealth about thirty kay behind us.
She's still throwing up a lot of dazzle,
but she's moving fast,
and she's definitely not here for the jellyfish."

Uncle Jack goggled at him.
"Pirates?" he spluttered.

"Only if we're lucky," Wales said grimly.
"We need to change course *now*, captain.
If we head straight for shore
I can put up some dazzle of my own
and try to keep us away from any drones she sends up."

Uncle Jack swore.
"Naggie! Up and movin', woman! We got trouble!"

Iffy had simmed dozens of chases at sea.
Sometimes she was the captain of a customs cutter
trying to catch a school of smugglebots.
Other times she was in command of a Zillion catamaran
skimming across the water under core-trimmed sails
with a hold full of organic food and subversive software.
Some of the sims ran for hours as she played gull and rat
among the jagged rocks of the Antarctic shore.
She had won more than she had lost,
but that was little comfort now that the game was real.

Wales winced but said nothing as the *Guinevere*'s coal engine sputtered to life.
The ship picked up speed
as her propellors churned the sea behind them into a white froth.
Uncle Jack's hands danced across the control panel,
telling the ship's core to tilt the sails all the way to their stalling line
to balance the increased thrust at the stern.
The ship swayed more wildly with each passing wave
as she traded stability for speed.

"Eighteen west, heading one sixty five, at twenty-six kay and change,"
Wales called as he ran to the bow to clip a battered black cylinder to the taffrail.
The ship's control panel wavered and reformed as the gadget powered up
and began spraying misinformation on all frequencies.

"How fast?" Uncle Jack growled.
"Tell me how shaddin' fast, man."

"Twenty kay an hour." Wales hesitated.
"Make that twenty-two.
She's military for sure."

Uncle Jack horked and spat into the garbage pail by his feet.
"Don't mean she ain't a pirate.
Naggie!
Bring me some affin' tea, woman, I got pilotin' to do!"

Iffy stepped out of the doorway to let her foster mother squeeze past her
and hand a thermos to her husband.
She put her arm around Iffy,
but the frightened expression on her face
cancelled out whatever reassurance she meant to give.
Jelly dredgers didn't have much worth stealing,
but the ships themselves were worth a lot—enough
for their captains to make a habit of sailing close by each other
whenever strangers were near.
And while Iffy didn't pay any more attention to politics than her homework required,
she knew that the tension between the Zillions
and the governors who ran Antarctica on Australia's behalf
was worse than it had ever been.

"Fifth."
Wales fished a plastic chip out of his pocket and handed it to Iffy.
"In my cabin,
the toolbox with the purple square on the end.
Can you get it for me, please?
Be sure to tap this near the handle before you open the cabin door."

The cold spray thrown up by their speed stung her face
as she ran to his cabin
and tapped the plastic shard on the door handle.
She waited for a click or a tone or *something*.
When nothing came she swallowed hard and yanked the door open.

Wales' three toolboxes lay side by side on the floor.
She lifted the one marked by a purple square,
turned around,
and squawked at the sight of Wales' toy bear crouched on all fours in the doorway.
Its blue eyes flickered.
She held her breath until it scurried across the floor
and disappeared into the odds and ends Wales had strapped against the locker's walls.

She hurried back to the pilot house,
the toolbox bruising her thigh with every second step.
"How we at?" she asked.

Wales shook his head as he took the toolbox from her.
"She hasn't changed course.
Either she doesn't know we've spotted her or she doesn't care."

"Or she's just waitin' 'til we're in closer to shore,"
Uncle Jack growled.
"She's got dazzle enough to cover th' both of us
if she gets us up against the rocks."
He swiped two fingers across the control panel
in an angry, futile attempt
to squeeze a little more speed out of the *Guinevere*'s struggling engine.

Wales hefted his toolbox.
"I might be able to do something about that.
Excuse me."
He squeezed past Iffy and Aunt Naggie.

"You go lend 'im a hand,"
Aunt Naggie told Iffy in a low voice.
"I'm gonna make some more tea an' put some food together.
No sense bein sunk on an empty stomach."

"Ain't nobody gonna sink us," Uncle Jack snapped
without taking his eyes off the control panel.
Aunt Naggie shooed Iffy out of the pilot house without replying.

Wales was on one knee near the bow beside his open toolbox.
The half-assembled drone in his hands
was the same size as the toy bear in his room
but skinned with camo
that changed color to match his hands and coat and the deck
every time he turned it over.

Using a pair of diamond-tipped tweezers,
Wales detached a manipulator as thin as a drinking straw
and placed it carefully back in the toolbox.
"Have to cut the weight," he explained to Iffy without looking up.
"We're going to need all the range we can get."

He removed the drone's other tiny arm,
stowed it beside its twin,
and handed the compact little machine to Iffy.
"Probably best if you don't tell your uncle about this part," he said quietly
as he used the nail of his left thumb
to peel the false skin back from the pad of his right forefinger.
Underneath lay a small patch of silver
whose lights blinked in time with the larger square set in his temple.

Iffy gasped. "Are you trans?"

Wales glanced at her, a wry smile on his face.
"You know, that used to mean something very different.
But no, I'm not transhuman.
I just don't like advertising how much tech I have in me.
It's hard enough having people try to cut my head off every once in a while—if
I had to worry about waking up minus a finger or two I'd never get any sleep."

He pressed his silver fingertip against the side of his toolbox.
"Sixteen orange kneecap," he said quietly.

Iffy held her breath,
half-expecting the toolbox to transform itself into—well,
she didn't know what, but *something*.
Instead,
a tiny blue light blinked twice in the handle.

Wales took a deep breath and lifted the toolbox's inside
to reveal a shallow compartment in the bottom.
Nestled among the tech hidden there were half a dozen small cylinders,
each the size of Iffy's little finger.
Four empty holes showed where others had once been.
Using his tweezers once again,
Wales plucked one of the cylinders from its resting place
and inserted it into the base of the drone.

"Is that a battery?" Iff guessed.

Wales shook his head.
"The drone's battery is built in.
This is…
This is just in case."
He reassembled the bottom of the toolbox and tossed the drone into the air.

It rose, started to fall, and then—Iffy blinked.
She couldn't see any rotors or hear any buzzing or whining.
The drone just *floated*,
its sides shimmering slightly as if it were a hologram.

"Ionizing impellers,"
Wales explained before Iffy could ask.
"It was designed to fly on Mars,
but they work in our atmosphere too."

Before Iffy could ask how a drone built to explore Mars
wound up in a toolbox in Antarctica,
Wales pointed his silver-tipped finger toward the horizon.
With no more command than that the drone shot away,
disappearing as its camo matched the blue, gray, and white of the sky, sea, and waves.

Wales locked his toolbox and folded the false skin back in place over his fingertip.
"Let's watch from inside."

Uncle Jack was chewing the end of his beard as they entered the pilot house.
"Well?" he demanded.

Instead of answering
Wales pressed his palm against the nearest corner of the control panel.
The images from the ship's cameras slid aside to make room for a larger one.

Seen from on high through a fisheye lens,
the ocean looked like a crumpled sheet of gray plastic.
The irregular lines running diagonally across it were wave crests,
and the speck near the bottom was the *Guinevere*.
There was nothing around them but emptiness.

"Have you sent a distress call?" Wales asked quietly.

Uncle Jack scowled.
"Nearest shout I got back is a hundred kay east,
but they're smaller than us an' too scared to fight.
Halley wasn't much interested 'til I told them our friends looked military.
Then they made noises about lookin' into it and dropped off comms.
And then the shaddin' *comms* dropped off."
He jabbed a finger at a small image in the corner of the control panel
that was blinking an orange warning.
Whoever was hunting them was blocking their transmissions.
They were on their own.

"All right, let's get a look at you," Wales said under his breath.
He slid his hand across the control panel again.
The scene shifted as the drone tilted its camera forward and narrowed its focus
to zoom in on a dark blur on the ocean below.
Its outline remained blurry even as it grew larger.
That was its camo,
Iffy guessed—thousands of micro-thin strips of smart material
absorbing and re-emitting light,
infrared,
radar,
and everything else that might reveal the ship's position and profile.
The flurries of multi-colored speckles
that swept across the image every few seconds
were the camo's electronics at work,
doing for the intruder what she hoped Wales' gear was doing for the *Guinevere*.

Even blurred,
the ship was a frightening sight,
long and lean and four times the *Guinevere*'s size,
the narrow V of her wake betraying the power of her engines.

"Saints and their mercies!"
Aunt Naggie exclaimed from behind Iffy,
a tray of tea mugs in her arms.
"That's the bloody *Taroona*!"

As if in answer a splash of text began scrolling next to the image.
*Glenunga*-class forward combat asset…
active keel…
modified infrared profile…
modified camouflage…
The words solidified into a spider-web of facts and guesswork
as the *Guinevere*'s core tried to make sense of what it was seeing.

Iffy opened her mouth to ask Wales
if the Australians were after him or the gear in his toolboxes,
then closed it.
Now wasn't the time,
especially not with Uncle Jack there.

"How fast can that thing o' yours move?"
Uncle Jack asked as the ship swelled on the screen.

"Mach three and change," Wales replied. "Hang on."

The image tilted and swooped as the drone dove toward the sea below,
levelling off at the last moment to skim the tops of the waves.
A trio of graphs appeared at the top of the control panel.
Wales cursed under his breath.

"What now?" Uncle Jack demanded.

"They're using some kind of multipath radar rig," Wales muttered.

"Is that bad?" Iffy asked anxiously.

"It means they can tell someone is looking at them,
but they won't be able to get a lock.
I hope," Wales amended grimly.
The *Taroona*'s outline suddenly came into focus
as the drone got close enough
for its tiny core to see through the ship's dazzle.

"She's murder in high heels an' a corset," Uncle Jack growled.
The stubby frames of railguns bristled at her bow and stern,
freed from whatever disguise had concealed them while the ship was docked in Halley.
The large tube amidships had to be some sort of EM pulse cannon,
Iffy guessed—at least,
that's what it would be if this was a sim.
But the most frightening thing was what *wasn't* there:
no flag,
no call numbers,
nothing to give her any sort of identity.
Not even her name,
so defiantly displayed when she was tied up in port.
She was hunting now,
not swaggering.

Without warning the display went blank.
"What happened?" Uncle Jack demanded as the image re-formed.

"Laser burst," Wales said curtly.
"The drone's core is shielded,
but another hit like that will fry the ionizers.
No way they did that from so far out.
They must have a shark in the water
or something in the air I can't spot.
I'm going to pull back."
Even as he spoke, the *Taroona* began to dwindle.

"Dammit!" Uncle Jack slapped the controls in frustration.
"We can't outrun 'em."

Wales drummed his fingers.
"Maybe we don't have too."
A swirl of false-color oranges and pinks bloomed on the control panel.
A heavy line marked the shore
and a pair of dots marked the *Guinevere* and her pursuer.

Wales pointed at a splotch of pink between the two dots.
"There—there's a ridge about two hundred meters down.
Satellites picked up a mudslide this morning,
and there's been bubbling since."
He glanced at the *Guinevere*'s captain.
"It's a sea boil waiting to happen," he translated.
"If it blows, it'll slow her down or scare her off."

"If?" Uncle Jack spat.
"If don't help us!"

"Leave that to me," Wales said.
Thin white lines appeared and disappeared on the display
as he and the *Guinevere*'s core explored a thousand possible futures.
After a couple of seconds
their criss-cross confusion locked into place.
Wales tapped the image.
"That's our best chance.
Head for these coordinates.
I'll update them as I get more data from the drone."

"It's affin' madness to be steerin' *into* a boil," Uncle Jack grumbled,
bending the *Guinevere*'s path to port despite his words.
He grabbed a sandwich from Aunt Naggie's tray,
gobbled half in a single hasty bite,
and chased it down with a gulp of tea and a belch.
Wales took a second ceramic mug and sipped its contents.

Aunt Naggie handed Iffy the remaining mug.
"I'll be down in th' galley," she said.

Uncle Jack eyed Iffy,
clearly expecting her to follow her foster mother,
but said nothing when she stayed.
Her tea tasted metallic in her mouth.
It took her a moment to realize that she had bitten her lip.
Her heart was pounding.
This wasn't a sim.
This wasn't anything like a sim.
This was *terrifying*.

Wales grunted beside her.
"She's turning faster than I expected.
I'll update the model."
The white lines on the screen danced and twisted again,
settling quickly back into a pattern as confusing as the original.

Wales grunted again.
"Four minutes to optimal position.
Assuming they're not skewing the nav to throw us off track."

Soft green digits in the corner of the control panel counted down the seconds.
The tension in the pilot house stretched
until Iffy thought it would snap like a rubber band.
Uncle Jack's knuckles were white on the wheel,
and she couldn't quite seem to catch her breath.
Even Wales seemed to feel it.
He flew the drone in a back-and-forth sweep,
never too far in front of the Aussie warship
but never letting it close in enough to take another shot with its laser.

Three minutes.
Two.
One.
"Show time," Wales said quietly.
He bowed his head as if in prayer.
The image on the screen steadied as the drone slowed and stopped.
The Aussie ship drew closer,
gray and single-purposed like the shark in Iffy's nature book.

The map on the control panel tilted to show depth.
The ridge on the sea floor lay directly beneath the drone,
orange splashed with warning pink.
"Ten seconds," Wales said.
Before Iffy could ask, "Until what?"
the drone dove straight down into the water.

The image from its cameras dimmed and went black
as the drone left the light behind.
Two white sparks appeared on the map next to *Taroona*
and sped toward the blue dot that marked the drone's position.
"*Ta ma dé*," Wales swore.

The drone plummeted toward the sea floor as the *Taroona*'s torpedoes closed in,
finally able to get a lock on their target from its trail in the water.
"C'mon c'mon c'mon," Iffy pleaded,
not realizing she was speaking aloud.

The drone's dot disappeared.
A balloon of red light expanded where it had been
as the finger-sized bomb it carried did what bombs have been doing
for as long as there have been bombs.
The torpedoes tried to curve away, but it was too late.
Their trajectories disappeared as they intersected the expanding violet blob.

And then the blob touched the sea floor.
The pink blotch beneath it writhed like like a living thing.
Graphs flashed onto the screen,
probability surfaces dancing in three dimensions
as the *Guinevere*'s core tried to predict what would happen next.

"Oh hell," Wales said softly
as a section of the sea ridge started sliding slowly into the depths.
Blue fissure lines flashed along the edges of the mudslide like lightning,
their bright lines connecting and spreading in a sudden spiderweb fracture.

"Come about," Wales snapped at Uncle Jack. "Now!"

The *Guinevere*'s captain didn't need to be told twice.
"I told you this was stupid!"
he shouted as his hands danced across the controls.

Iffy grabbed the door frame to keep her feet
as the *Guinevere* heeled over to starboard.
"What's happening?" she asked.

"Fault line in the ridge," Wales said angrily.
"It wasn't in the survey data and the satellite couldn't see it.
The last bot to scan that area must have—"
He cut himself off and pressed his hand onto the control panel.
The map and graphs were replaced by a grainy image
that zoomed in to show the now-familiar outline of the *Taroona*.
"Hang on!" he ordered as the sea behind them started to bubble.

Iffy couldn't look away.
The mudslide started by the bomb the drone had been carrying
had broken up a field of barely-frozen clathrate ice,
releasing enormous bubbles of methane.
As they rose to the surface they churned the sea into
a froth unable to bear the weight of a ship.

Too late, the *Taroona* realized the danger beneath her.
Her stern dipped, throwing her bow into the air.
She tipped on her side and slid down into the dark unforgiving ocean.

"Saints and their mercies," Uncle Jack said quietly.

But no—there she was, still afloat!
She wasn't a jelly dredger or a cargo hauler.
She had been built to withstand gunfire
and scalpel mines
and the storms of the great southern ocean.
She bobbed and wallowed like an oversized bath toy,
her deadly grace gone,
but as the water that had tried to claim her sluiced off her sides
she turned toward the *Guinevere*.
Twin jets of white steam spurted from her stern as her engines briefly lifted above the waves,
and she surged forward once again.

"Crap," Wales said under his breath.

Uncle Jack said something louder and much worse.
Wales caught his wrist as he reached for the control panel.
"What are you doing?"

"Cuttin' the affin' engines!"
Uncle Jack yanked his arm free,
as angry Iffy had ever seen him.
"You can't sink 'em and we can't outrun 'em
so th'only thing we got is a run up a white flag
and hope you're all they take!
And if you ever lay hands to me again on *my* ship, I'll—"

*BOOM!*
Yellow-red flame jetted from the *Taroona*'s side.
Iffy shrieked as a second blurred streak hit the Aussie ship,
then a third,
each striking right at the waterline.
As the *Taroona* shuddered under the force of the blows,
an explosion inside the ship kicked her sideways like a child's toy.

"Ya killed 'em,"
Iffy whispered unbelievingly
as the *Taroona* broke in two.
She dragged her sleeve across her face.
"Ya killed 'em all.
Why'd ya do that?"

"That wasn't me!"
Wales' hands danced across the control panel.
"Damn it!
I need to get another drone up there."

"No you don't," Uncle Jack said flatly, pointing out the window.

A ship had appeared out of nowhere,
its camo briefly disrupted by the missiles it had launched.
Where the *Taroona* and the *Guinevere* were metal,
the newcomer was made of engineered bamboo.
Her dozen sails were a tangle of fractal geometry
too complex to be managed or even really understood by a merely human mind.
Her green and yellow pennant with the slogan *Este mundo é de deus*
proclaimed to all who she was,
while her railguns and missile racks said just as plainly what she had been built for:
war.

"Zillions…" Iffy whispered.
Everyone knew the words on that flag—knew them and feared them.
Brazil had fought beside the rest of humanity during the war,
but had turned on their allies once the bots were defeated.
"This world is God's!" they screamed in sim after sim,
always the villains.
The earth's self-appointed defenders would sacrifice everything
to undo the damage humanity had done to the Earth.
Whenever a shaft in a coal mine collapsed
people blamed Zillion saboteurs.
When a mutant fungus turned the contents of a greenhouse into sludge,
all its owner had to do was say,
"It musta been Zillions!"
for people to demand that the governors *do* something.
And when a Zillion trader was brave enough or stupid enough
to go more than a block or two from Halley's market by themselves
and woke up in hospital,
everyone just nodded at the Marines' straight-faced apologies
for the inexplicable glitch in their drones' recordings
that left them unable to identify anyone who might have been involved.

Even as they watched,
the Zillion ship blurred and vanished once again.
The faint spiderweb tracery of her rigging glinted in the sun,
then it too was gone.
"Why'd they—" Iffy felt lightheaded.
"Why'd they do that?
Why'd they kill 'em?"

"Because they could," Wales replied wearily.
"There's no way they could get past the *Taroona*'s defenses
when she was running at spec,
but knocked off balance the way she was…"
He shrugged.
"They saw a shot and they took it."

"A shot *you* gave 'em," Uncle Jack said accusingly,
quick as always to make sure trouble was someone else's fault.
"There's gonna be hell t' pay for this."
He slapped at the control panel to put the *Guinevere* in a tight turn.

"Wait—no! We can't go back for them."
Wales reached for the panel.

Uncle Jack slapped his hand away.
"We don't leave folk in a water," he said flatly.

Wales shook his head.
"Look."
Another pink blotch was rising from the ocean floor on the panel in front of them.
It churned and reformed
as the *Guinevere*'s simple-minded sonar tried to make sense of a maelstrom of bubbles.
When it reached the surface the broken remains of the *Taroona* disappeared.

Uncle Jack swore again.
For a moment Iffy thought he was going to hit Wales.
Instead,
he swiped his hand across the control panel to turn them back toward Rothera.

All of a sudden Iffy needed to be somewhere else—anywhere else.
She threw open the door of the pilot house
and stumbled out into the endless hard light of the southern summer.
Her feet took her to the galley on auto-pilot.
She pulled open the hatch and fell into her foster mother's arms.
Aunt Naggie wrapped her meaty arms around her adopted daughter.
"Sweetie, what's wrong?"

"They dead!" Iffy cried.
"They all sunk an' dead!"

"Oh, sweetie."
Aunt Naggie hugged her tight, rocking her from side to side.
"Oh, sweetie…"
For a moment Iffy thought she heard another voice say,
"I love you so much,"
but no.
There were just her sobs
and the hum of the engines
and the muffled sound of the uncaring sea.

## Chapter 4

Her tears eventually stopped, as tears always do.
After one last hug from her foster mother,
Iffy left Aunt Naggie in the galley
and sat on the thwart at the *Guinevere*'s stern,
gray thoughts chasing each other aimlessly in her head.
She half-hoped that Wales would sit beside her so that she could be curt to him.
Instead,
he disappeared into his cabin,
ignoring Uncle Jack's angry questions about
what the hell a civilian was doing with a bomb in his affing luggage.
*Wait 'til you find out about the other ones,* Iffy thought dully.

Sunk in misery,
it took her a moment to realize that something was moving above the horizon.
She stood and shaded her eyes,
squinting against the dazzle from the waves
until she was sure she was seeing the wispy smudge of a spotter drone's gossamer wings.
Why was it approaching from the west?
Halley lay east of them.
Unless—
"Uncle Jack!" she shouted,
sprinting toward the pilot house.
"Uncle Jack, it's the Zillions!
They're comin' back for us!"

"Hang about a sec," her uncle said
to a face on to the control panel as she charged in.
"What?"

"Uncle Jack," she panted.
"There's a Zillion spotter comin in!"

"That ain't the Zillions," her uncle said scornfully.
"It's outta Rothera."
He jerked his thumb at the face on the screen.
"Lady here says they been lookin' for us.
Or leastways, they been lookin' for our passenger.
Seems he's quite a popular fellow."

Iffy looked from her uncle to the screen.
An old woman smiled back warmly.
Her brown face was lined with a century of wrinkles,
and her pure white hair
was pulled back tightly into a complicated bun
in a style that Iffy had only ever seen in history lessons.
"Hello," the face said.
"You must be Miz Kwan.
I'm Doctor Johel.
I'm looking forward to meeting you."

They reached Rothera two days later.
The spotter traced lazy circles above them the whole way,
its insect-eye cameras and microscopic core
searching ceaselessly for signs of trouble.
Each time Wales emerged from his cabin
to get some tea or use the toilet,
the spotter swooped closer to the *Guinevere*
like a gull that had spotted someone eating a sandwich.

Uncle Jack grumbled ceaselessly about surveillance
and how the governors shouldn't be allowed to get away with it
but what could decent hard-working folk do?
Aunt Naggie went from her cabin to the galley and back again with hurried steps,
head down,
uncomfortable but bearing it in silence the way she bore so much else.
Wales paid no more attention to the drone than he did to Iffy and her foster parents.
"Good morning", "excuse me", and "no thank you"
were all he seemed to have the energy to say.

But Iffy was fascinated.
Skies the world over had been off limits since the end of the war:
the machines couldn't watch the whole world all the time,
but anything too big or moving too quickly
ran the risk of being fried from orbit.
A few heavily armored aircraft still flew short missions here and there,
but for most people,
anything more than a short ground-hugging flight
had once again become the stuff of dreams.
The spotter drone was the biggest winged craft Iffy had ever seen up close—she spent
every moment she could steal
studying it through a high-powered monocular.
And truth be told,
there wasn't much else to do.

They threaded their way through the narrow passage
between Adelaide Island and the Antarctic Peninsula,
past drifting mats of tweaked seaweed left over from someone's failed attempt to start a sea farm,
and there it was—Rothera.
The capital of Australia's Antarctic province
was ten times the size of Halley,
home port for the fleet that glared at the southernmost tip of South America across the Drake Passage
and the Zillion marauders who used it as a base.

A pair of sleek sentry torpedoes surfaced beside them
as they rounded the rocky point
where the scavenged remains of the original research station stood.
Normally bustling with warships, freighters, jelly dredgers, tugs, and water taxis,
Rothera's harbor seemed unnaturally quiet.
"Governor's orders," Aunt Naggie told Iffy,
passing her a hard-boiled egg liberally dusted with curry powder.
"That's what Jack says—everyone's been told
to stay outta the way 'til we tie up.
Whatever Mister Wales did scared 'em all pretty hard."

Her meager lunch inside her,
Iffy went back on deck.
Wales was leaning on the taffrail,
his eyes as distant as his thoughts.
Iffy hesitated,
thinking about all the times she'd tried to make friends with people
only to put her foot in her mouth,
then stepped up to the taffrail a meter away from him and leaned on it as well.

He looked sideways at her.
"I'm sorry about what happened."

"No worries," she said.
Together, they watched the shore approach.

Wales sighed.
"You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy,"

Iffy bridled. "It ain't that bad."

Wales chuckled.
"It's a quote from an old sim.
And no, it isn't that bad."
His half-smile slipped slightly.
"Or at least, I hope it isn't."

Thin trails of soot drew diagonal charcoal lines across the sky above the city
as the *Guinevere* approached.
Iffy glanced at Wales,
but he showed no emotion at the sight.
The Peninsula's coal mines were the original source of Rothera's wealth,
the reason both for one of the governors being there
and for the Zillions' prowling and raids.
It was a crime to burn fossil fuel everywhere in the world that still had laws,
but when pressed about their seemingly endless exemptions,
most of Rothera's citizens would shrug point out that
the whole of Antarctica would still be covered in ice
if it weren't for the Melt.
And if cities elsewhere had drowned
and people had starved or had to flee their homes
in the years before the machine wars,
well,
damage done.

When the wind shifted,
the city's smell hit Iffy like a wet hammer.
Rothera didn't just have coal mines—it had a dredging fleet too,
and rendering plants to process what they brought in.
The reek of tonnes of jellyfish being turned into fuel and fertilizer
was like being hit hard with a pillow.
Wales wrinkled his nose in disgust,
but Iffy took a deep breath,
held it until she thought her lungs might burst,
and let it out in a whoosh.
That stink meant Rothera,
and Rothera meant Honesty,
and Honesty meant—well,
Iffy was still trying to work exactly what Honesty meant.

The torpedoes peeled away as they entered the harbor
to resume their endless patrol.
The spotter drone overhead banked and turned back out to sea a few moments later,
the sun sparkling off the solar cells in its wings.
Iffy watched it go,
wishing she too could spread her wings and go anywhere at all.

A quartet of Marines stood on the pier
in a semi-circle around the old woman they had spoken with two days earlier.
An armored bot the size of the *Guinevere*'s pilot house loomed behind them.
Someone had turned the "0" of the "G-80" stencilled on its side
into a scowling face.
Other Marines were scattered among crates and machines
or on the decks of nearby ships,
their positions selected after a millisecond of high-intensity simulation by the city's core.
Other than them the pier was deserted.
So were the piers on either side, Iffy realized.

"Sharks in the water," Wales murmured beside her
as a mechanical shape twice the size of the sentry torpedoes swam beneath them.
"And that minitank on the pier isn't just for show."
He nodded almost imperceptibly toward the hulking bot.
"See its treads? They've been reinforced for urban work."
He looked past Iffy as Aunt Naggie came on deck
to put her arm around Iffy's shoulders
and gave her foster daughter a wordless squeeze of reassurance.
"I'm sorry for all this."

Aunt Naggie shrugged.
"Be sorrier if we were dead."

The *Guinevere* slowed and turned parallel to the pier.
Iffy shrugged off her foster mother's arm
and hurried forward to throw a line to a waiting Marine.
As he caught it,
another Marine leaped across the gap to the *Guinevere*'s stern.
Despite the weight of his exoskeleton,
his boots made no more sound hitting the deck than a seagull flapping its wings.

Uncle Jack strode onto the deck and put his hands on his hips.
"Well," he said to no one in particular,
standing a little straighter than usual
in a bright orange suit jacket that had probably fit him well twenty years ago.
"Let's get this over with."
With one final glare at Wales
he let the gangplank thud onto the pier
and stumped down to meet their welcoming committee.

Wales stepped aside to let Aunt Naggie follow her husband
and then picked up the toolbox with the purple square on the end.
"How about you bring those?" he said to Iffy,
nodding at the two remaining toolboxes.
"And stay close—as long as we don't startle anyone,
everything will be fine."

*I'm not your swabbie,*
Iffy thought angrily,
but followed him down the gangplank with one box in each hand anyway.

Doctor Johel stepped forward to greet them.
"Johnson," she said warmly,
extending her hand.
"Such a pleasure to see you again."
Her clipped accent was straight out of an old story sim
and her eyes actually sparkled as she and Wales shook hands.

"And you, doctor."
Wales bowed his head slightly before releasing her hand.
"My apologies for the trouble I must have caused."

"No apology necessary," Doctor Johel said briskly.
"Pirates are pirates no matter whose flag they fly,
and it's useful to know
that the Brazilians are able to get that close without being detected."

Wales inclined his head again.
"As you say." He hesitated.
"Do you know how many were lost?"

The tiny woman's expression didn't soften.
"I'm afraid not.
And even if we did,
Intelligence might not share that information."

"And Miz Kwan," she continued smoothly,
turning to Iffy and holding out her hand again.
"A pleasure to meet you as well.
I'm grateful to you for helping Mister Wales get here in one piece."

"No worries," Iffy mumbled,
setting down the toolboxes and shaking Doctor Johel's hand gingerly.
The old woman was no taller than Iffy,
and her wrinkled brown skin felt like warm plastic.
Up close,
the sparkle in her eyes was more than just a trick of the light,
but Iffy couldn't tell if she was tweaked
or if the gleaming motes were some kind of tech.

"And I'm Jack Ng, thank you for askin'," Uncle Jack broke in,
stepping forward and thrusting out his hand.
"I'm th' captain of th' *Guinevere*,
an' what I want to know is,
how soon can I get back on the water?"

"I'm sure the governor will tell you that when you see him,"
Doctor Johel said,
pointedly ignoring his hand.

"When I what? I'm not—will you stop pesterin' me, woman?"
He shrugged Aunt Naggie's cautioning hand off his arm angrily.
"I'm not talkin' to th' governor!
I was hired for a job, plain an' simple.
I just want t' be paid an' then I'm done with it."

"That will be for the governor to decide,"
Doctor Johel said,
a hint of steel in her voice.
"Now, if you'll come this way?"
She turned toward shore.
The armored bot pivoted smoothly on its heavy treads
and lowered one of its arms.
The elderly doctor sat on it as if were a park bench—as if
being carried gently along a pier by a century-old war machine
was the most natural thing in the world.

"Show-off," Uncle Jack grumbled.
"Treatin' that thing like it's some kind o' pet rat."

"Actually,
she trained its core on a sim of a guard dog she once had,"
Wales said drily.
He picked up his toolbox and nudged Iffy with his elbow.
"Come along.
Our day's not over yet."

Two dozen people stood waiting at the base of the pier
under the watchful eyes of yet another squad of Marines.
Iffy recognized some of them
as crew from the ships tied up on either side of the *Guinevere*.
Her cheeks burned under their curious stares.
Some nodded but no one said hello.

They followed Doctor Johel and the G-80 to the harbor gate,
where a short bus the same navy blue as the Marines' uniforms stood waiting.
The G-80 stopped beside it to let Doctor Johel stand.
"After you," she said,
gesturing at the bus's open door.
Wales inclined his head once again and climbed aboard
with Iffy, Uncle Jack, and Aunt Naggie behind him.

"I haven't been in one of these in years," Wales said,
seating himself near the front with his toolbox at his feet.

"I ain't never," Iffy confessed
as she slid the two she was carrying under a seat
and sat down across from him.
"They must think pretty highly o' you to lay on such a fuss."

Wales laughed humorlessly and nudged his toolbox with his boot.
"I suspect that what they think highly of is this.
And if they thought they could take it away from me without consequences,
I'm pretty sure our welcome would have been much less friendly."
He raised an eyebrow at Doctor Johel.
The old woman smiled back but said nothing.

Rothera bustled around them once the bus left the dock behind.
They hummed quietly through the city streets
and up the long, gentle slope that led to the governor's mansion.
The G-80 stayed five meters in front of them,
its twin turrets swivelling each time they went through an intersection.
The Marines jogged along on either side with long mechanical strides.
Traffic pulled aside to let them pass,
but Iffy didn't see any of the mad scramble
that a convoy like theirs would cause in Halley.
Her heart skipped a beat once
when she thought she saw a familiar face in the crowd,
but then the girl turned her head and she realized it was someone else.

As they drew closer to the governor's mansion,
the three-story cinderblock buildings thrown up to house
refugees from the Melt and then the war
gave way to newer, brighter construction.
Foamed glass reflected blue sky and spindly anti-drone laser towers.
Iffy pressed her face against the window
and stared hungrily at the greenhouses nestled among the towers' feet.
Mangoes and oranges and flowers—flowers!—made
a green riot beneath the sheltering panels.
Little Mrs. Sandhu claimed that the governor even grew bananas,
though Big Mrs. Sandhu scoffed at the notion.
"They been extinct longer than we been alive,"
she said in a tone that brooked no argument.

Iffy's stomach suddenly rumbled.
Doctor Johel smiled at her.
"I'm sure lunch will be served," she promised.

"Thanks," Iffy mumbled,
feeling her foster father's glare on her back.
Suddenly resentful of his disapproval,
she asked, "So what kind o' doctor are you?"

"The medical kind, originally," the old woman replied,
turning in her seat so that she was fully facing Iffy.
"But I've been focused on engineering for the last few years.
There's still a lot of technology left over from the machine wars
that we don't understand,
and it's my department's job to secure it.
Or render it harmless," she added,
raising her wispy eyebrows at Wales.
He smiled as if Doctor Johel had paid him a compliment.

A wrought iron fence surrounded the governor's mansion.
Sleek robotic sentries paced back and forth behind it,
their blunt conical heads turning to track the approaching vehicles.
The G-80 pulled to the side to let the bus go through the gate,
but the Marines stayed beside them all the way to
the turnaround in front of the mansion's main doors.

A triangular diamond wedge glistened in the center of the gravel circle,
familiar to Iffy from dozens of pictures.
"In memory" was engraved on each of its faces.
In memory of those lost when the ice melted and the sea rose.
In memory of those who fell fighting the machines in the war that followed.
In memory of all the species now extinct,
the giraffes and tigers and all the others that now existed only in books and sims.
Iffy paused a moment as she came out of the bus to look at it,
a strange ache in her chest as she wondered
who was remembering the crew of the *Taroona*.

"Get along wi' you," Uncle Jack growled,
nudging her brusquely.
Flanked by Marines,
they followed Doctor Johel through the mansion's doors.

And then waited.
Iffy wasn't sure what she had been expecting,
but sitting on a comfortable couch with potted plants on either side
and soft music playing in the background wasn't it.
Uncle Jack kept his arms crossed and muttered to himself incessantly,
glaring at Aunt Naggie when she ventured that the governor must be very busy,
really,
it wasn't surprising that he couldn't see them right away,
and she was sure he wouldn't be much longer.

Wales didn't seem bothered by the delay.
At one point Iffy thought he had actually fallen asleep,
but then he grimaced and opened his eyes.
"They're locked down tight," he sighed quietly,
tapping the tech in his temple with a finger.

Iffy nodded toward the three toolboxes on the floor between them.
"Least they let you keep your gear."

Wales smiled.
"They didn't really have much of—ah, here we go."
He stood and brushed his hands on his trousers
as the door across from them swung open with soft pneumatic whoosh.
It and the wall were as thick as Iffy's slab mattress.
Armor?
Soundproofing?
She didn't have time to wonder before Doctor Johel beckoned them to join her.

"The governor will see you now," she said.
"But I'm afraid you'll have to leave those here."

"Of course." Wales nudged the toolbox nearest him with his boot.
"Shall we say…half an hour?"

"I should think that would be adequate," Doctor Johel replied.
She stepped to the side and beckoned them through.

"Half an hour 'til what?" Iffy whispered to Wales.

"Until it decides I'm not coming back and makes a fuss about it,"
he whispered back.

The windowless office Doctor Johel showed them into
was the same size as the room they had been waiting in.
Framed photographs on the walls traced the history of Rothera
from its early days as a research station
through the opening of the mines
and its years as a labor camp
for people that the revolutionary government in far-off London didn't want at home
but didn't want to compost—at least, not yet.
The largest picture was of the Union Jack being raised in Hobart
after London fell to the machines.
A smaller one beneath it showed what was left of the old country's drowned and abandoned capital.

A plain wooden desk stood near one wall
with half a dozen simple wooden chairs in front of it.
A Marine with three stripes on her sleeve gestured for them all to sit.
She studied them for a heartbeat,
eyes jumping from one to the next,
then said,
"All clear, sir."

"Thank you, sergeant."
The words seemed to come out of thin air.
Iffy's jaw dropped as the air behind the desk shimmered
to reveal a tall man in a formal black turtleneck,
slightly stooped with age but still strong,
his face exactly the one in the picture that hung in the Sandhu's grocery store—exactly
like the faces of his two clones who had occupied similar offices in Halley and Paddington South
for almost a hundred years.

"As you were," Governor Stern Rothera said pleasantly,
waving Uncle Jack and Aunt Naggie back into their seats as they started to rise.
He nodded at Doctor Johel and sat somewhat stiffly behind his desk.
"Thank you for coming.
I trust your trip here from the docks was less eventful
than your encounter with our Brazilian friends?"

The room was silent as everyone waited for Wales to reply.
When it became clear he wasn't going to,
Uncle Jack cleared his throat.
"Er, yes, your honor, clear skies 'n' smooth sailin."
He bobbed his head.
"Glad t' help.
Happy to, any time you need."

The governor nodded his head gravely.
"Thank you, Captain Ng.
The government appreciates your service.
And you, Mister Wales," he continued,
looking directly at the American for the first time.
"Will you be happy to help too?"

Wales never got to answer.
Something screamed outside,
a shrill mechanical sound that ended in the flat crack of an explosion.
A dozen pop-up displays instantly materialized above the desk
to show aerial views and schematics splashed with red danger markers.
The Marine sergeant took two quick steps
and pressed the tip of her stiffened finger against Wales' head.
He raised his hands.
"It's not mine!" he protested.
"It's not mine!"

The door burst open.
Half a dozen Marines poured into the room.
"Sir, it's the G-80," the one in front said,
urgent but calm as his conditioning took control.
"It—"
A second shriek and *crack!* cut off the rest of his sentence.
"You need to evacuate, sir," the Marine continued.

A section of the wall behind the governor's desk slid sideways
to reveal a ramp leading down into the bedrock below the mansion.
The governor stayed where he was.
A single swipe of his hand
enlarged a feed from the front of the mansion
just as the hulking warbot fire another micro-missile
at the pack of sentries swarming it.
Shriek—*crack!*
The explosion threw a shattered sentry twenty meters.
The G-80 pivoted on its treads,
swinging it arms like clubs to knock another sentry into the air.

"Doctor?" the governor asked calmly.
"You told me its core was secure."

"It was," she replied, her voice icy.
"Mister Wales?"

"It's not me! I swear, this isn't me!" Wales repeated emphatically,
tilting his head slightly
under the pressure of the Marine's gun finger against his temple.

"Sir—" the Marine began.

"In a moment," the governor said sharply.
A pair of sentry bots charged the G-80 simultaneously.
It knocked the first one away and grabbed the second with its heavy square claws.

The image flashed blue for a moment.
"EMP?" Doctor Johel gasped disbelievingly.
"It doesn't have a pulse generator!"

The image reformed.
The G-80 dropped the sentry bot it had picked up.
It and its packmages turned their heads toward the mansion in unison.
The last thing Iffy saw before her foster mother dragged her away
was the G-80 tearing the door off its hinges.

"Breach!" one of the young Marines shouted.

"Really?" Wales muttered sarcastically,
his hands still in the air.

The sergeant behind him nudged him forward.
"Sir, if you would?"

Wales didn't move.
"Not without my tools."

Her second nudge was more of a shove.
"Sir, we can come back for—"

"If it takes too long for us to come back,
there won't be anything for us to come back *to*,"
Wales said sharply.
"Gayathri?"

Doctor Johel and the governor exchanged looks.
"Bring them," the governor ordered.

"Sir, it is against protocol to bring unaudited tech into the secure area,"
the sergeant protested.

"Executive override,"
the governor said crisply.
"Please don't make me regret this, Mister Wales."

Everything happened very quickly after that.
One Marine opened the door
and tossed a thumb-sized camera drone into the waiting room.
When it wasn't fried by a laser or shredded by a needle gun,
a second Marine bent low in a starter's crouch
and launched himself through the door.
Something sizzled across the shoulder of his exoskeleton
a millisecond before he crashed into the couch
that Iffy had been sitting on.
He rolled over clumsily.
"Left scapular is barbecue," he called
as he threw the first toolbox back through the door one-handed.

His partner caught it and set it down just in time to catch the second one.
"Wait!" Wales ordered
as the Marine in the waiting room reached for
the toolbox he had been carrying.
He closed his eyes for a moment, then nodded.
"Now!"

The third toolbox flew through the air.
The Marine crouched,
took a deep breath,
and threw himself after it.

Whatever had shot him the first time had been patient.
A perfectly straight line of blue light left a burning after-image on Iffy's eyes.
The Marine landed in a crumpled heap on the floor of the governor's office.
His exoskeleton tried to stand,
its programming still trying to anticipate its wearer's movement,
but it couldn't lift the dead weight it now held.

"Oh saints," Aunt Naggie whispered.

The Marine who had caught the toolboxes paid no attention to the burnt smell
as she pulled the battery and ammunition clips from her partner's body.
*It's the conditioning,* Iffy thought,
swalloing hard to stop herself from throwing up.
*Like Jeep when he came back. She just doesn't feel it.*

The Marines herded everyone down the stairs behind the governor's desk
into a narrow zig-zagging corridor that smelled like sweat and machinery.
Pipes ran along the ceiling,
a color-coded mix of water, sewage, secure optical cabling,
and highways for the rat-sized repair bots
that were now scurrying to defend the mansion.

"Any theories, doctor?" the governor asked.

"Not yet," Doctor Johel puffed, struggling to keep the pace.
"Nobody ever managed…
to breach the firewalls…
on the G-80s…
during the war.
And if someone has a way…
to infect the sentries…"

"It was optical," Wales cut in.
"That flash.
It wasn't an EMP,
it was some kind of optical reprogramming."

"But the… information density… that would take…"
Doctor Johel started.

"Shall we discuss this later, sirs?" the Marine sergeant cut in,
her tone making it clear that it wasn't actually a question.

Something chattered behind them.
Sharp dots stitched across the concrete above their heads.
"Affin' heck!" Uncle Jack squeaked.

Needle guns crackled
as two of the Marines spun around and returned fire.
"Go!" the sergeant ordered,
shoving them one by one toward the door at the end of the corridor.

Wales stumbled and went down on one knee.
"Sorry," he gasped.
Dark red blood spurted from twin punctures
where a needle had punched through his thigh.

The sergeant took his arm and began to drag him forward.
"No!" Wales shook her off.
"We can't outrun them."
He opened the toolbox,
pulled out the toy bear Iffy had last seen in his berth on the *Guinevere*,
and tossed it overhand down the corridor.

"What the hell are you doing? Sir?"
the Marine demanded incredulously
as the bear scuttled away
and Wales began pulling parts out of his toolbox.

"Saving us," Wales muttered.
Two skeletal legs,
a wheel of nested gears only slightly smaller than Iffy's hand,
a fold-up box to hold it all together—all of a sudden
Iffy could see in her head how they had to fit together.

"Lemme do that," she said
as Wales's shaking hands dropped a thumb-sized cylinder on the floor.
She twisted two already-assembled parts around,
tightened them,
and clipped the cylinder into place.
"It'll be more stable like this."

Wales passed her the rest of the parts.
When she handed the newly-made bot back to him
he turned it over for one last check
and then tossed it underhand at the wall.
Its gyroscopic gearwheel spinning madly,
the little machine scampered up to the ceiling.

"If that's a bomb—" the sergeant began.

"Directional sideband pulse generator," Wales panted
as the little machine disappeared around the corner.
"It'll blind them for sure, knock them out if we're lucky."

*I know that,* Iffy realized incredulously,
her vision blurring for a moment.
*How could I know that?
How did I know how to put it together?*

Wales struggled to his feet,
swaying slightly before putting a hand on the wall to steady himself.
Blood was no longer leaking out of his leg,
but when he tried to take a step he almost collapsed.
"Steady on," the sergeant said.
She switched her gun to her other hand
and slipped her shoulder under his.

The lights went out.
Iffy's heart skipped a beat even as they flickered back to life.
"That's one," Wales grunted.

Mechanical claws scraped on the concrete behind them.
Iffy spun around as a lone sentry bot came around the corner.
The now-empty micro-missile launcher on its back
gave it a hunched appearance,
and the fresh scratches on its side
where the mansion's mechanical rats had clawed it
made its camouflage flicker and jump.
Twin needle guns on the sides of its head chattered,
their ammunition spent.

The Marine pushed Wales away and fired two quick shots.
The sentry jerked as the ultra-dense needles pinged off one of its mechanical knees,
then charged with a grinding sound that could almost have been a growl.

Wales' toy bear dropped from the ceiling and landed on its back.
The lights went out again.
One second, two, three…
When they came on the sentry lay motionless on its side.
The toy bear stood over it,
the blue light in its eyes fading,
fading,
gone.

"Could you… could you please get that?"
Wales asked Iffy weakly
as he slumped down against the wall.
"I have a feeling we might need it again."

Iffy only managed two steps before the world swam around her.
She heard Wales call her name,
but it was as if he was speaking from unimaginably far away.
Everything seemed distant and tilted and swimmy
like the time she had tried drinking some of Uncle Jack's rum.
She turned slowly,
wondering who had replaced the walls with schematics.
"That conduit's gonna start leakin' if someone doesn't mend it,"
she tried to say,
but the words wouldn't come out.
Even if they had,
Wales and the Marine had been replaced by schematics too.

She woke up on a couch in yet another windowless office.
Something about the damp air told her she was underground.
She turned her head.
"Hey sweetie," Aunt Naggie said,
her soft voice and the gentle hand she put on her foster daughter's forehead
completely failing to disguise her relief.

"Hey," Iffy replied.
She let her aunt stop her from sitting up
with only a mumbled protest.

She turned her head at the sound of voices.
A medic with two tech fingers on her right hand
was patching Wales up on another couch while the governor interrogated him.
No,
Wales repeated wearily,
he had no idea how the G-80 had been compromised
or how it had infected the sentries.
No,
he wouldn't show them what else he had in his third toolbox—not yet.
And yes,
he did realize that made him look like he was hiding something.
"But we all have secrets, don't we?" he asked rhetorically,
eyeing his cut-off trouser leg sadly.
He hadn't flinched when the medic probed his wound
with a whisker-slim instrument extruded from one of her metal fingers
or when she started to fill in his leg with pink goo from a squeeze tube.

"My question is, what are yours?"
The governor paced restlessly as he spoke.
"What kind of man has a fully functional mil sat link in his head
and tactical antimatter in his luggage?"

Wales pushed the medic's hands away.
"The sort of man who can change the world for you,"
he said firmly.

Governor Stern pivoted to face him.
"Really?"
His eyes had the same sparkle as Doctor Johel's,
but in that underground room it was ominous instead of magical.

"Really."
Wales straightened up with a wince.
"Or at least, give you the tools you need to do it."
When the governor raised an eyebrow,
he continued,
"There's a research base at the foot of Mount Tyree,
a couple of hundred klicks inland from Paddington South.
It was under the ice sheet when it was built,
but there's been enough melt to expose the entrance."

The governor's fingers drummed on his thighs.
His eyes sparkled again—some kind of direct visual input
shining light straight into his retinas,
Iffy guessed.
"All right, there's a base,"
he said as whatever he had just seen confirmed what Wales had just said.
"But it was scavenged decades ago.
And anyway,
everybody who was anybody built some kind of secret lab down here.
What makes this one special?"

"It wasn't completely scavenged.
And it was never really a lab.
Or at least, not just a lab."
Wales glanced at Doctor Johel.
"It was a backup ground station for the Niobium network.
And as far as I can tell, it's still functional."

"Bullshit," Doctor Johel said,
as calmly as if she ordering a cup of tea.
"Governor,
I was part of the team that tried to reactivate Niobium.
There was nothing in any of the records about a backup station."

The governor cut her off with a gesture.
"Convince me," he ordered Wales.

Wales closed his eyes and reeled off a list of coordinates.
The numbers meant nothing to Iffy,
but from the looks on Governor Stern's and Doctor Johel's faces
it was clear they recognized at least some of them.
"I can bring up your drones, too,"
Wales said when he was done.
"If we can get to the base,
you can see everything the Brazilians have,
every moment of the day."

"And you're just going to give that to us out of the goodness of your heart?"
the governor asked skeptically.

"Of course not."
Wales nodded to the medic.
"Tell them what you found."

The medic looked at the governor for permission.
When the old man nodded,
she said,
"He's been tweaked, sir.
Oxygen uptake, metabolic efficiency, chromatin structure—it'll
take a while to sort it all out."

Governor Stern cocked his head to the side.
Every third person in Antarctica had inherited some minor tweak
from grandparents or great-grandparents
who had wanted a more efficient body,
suffered from some genetic disorder,
or had more money than sense.
"And?"

"And every once in a while I need a reset," Wales said.
He tapped the tech in his temple.
"This was designed for baseline human physiology.
It doesn't get along with my upgrades as well as I'd like.
My central nervous system starts to glitch if I don't re-set every few years.
I had some friends in Newfoundland do it last time,
but they all scattered when the civil war started."
He shrugged.
"As far as I know,
that base is the only other place on Earth with the gear I need
that isn't run by machines."

The governor nodded slowly.
"Interesting.
Who else knows about this?
No, no, none of that."
He waved away whatever Wales was about to say.
"Somebody or something went to a lot of trouble to hack Doctor Johel's precious G-80.
And then there's this."
He gestured to bring up a ghostly video of a patched-together maintenance bot
twitching and shaking on damp gray cobblestones.
Iffy gasped.
It was French Henry.
Even as she watched the bot froze,
its heavy manipulators still trying to pry open its own carapace.

"I don't believe in coincidences,"
the governor said,
"And neither does the city core,
so I'll ask again:
who else knows about this base?"

Wales exhaled slowly.
"The machines do,"
he admitted.
"Or at least,
some of their factions or subroutines.
Who knows how they think?"

"Who indeed?"
the governor echoed.
He and Doctor Johel looked at each other,
their eyes sparkling as they communed with each other and Rothera's core.
"Very well,"
the governor said crisply.
"Sergeant?"

"Yes sir?"

The governor waved at Iffy and her foster parents.
"Take the Kwans back to their ship.
You can resupply while you wait for us to decide what to do with you,"
he continued as Uncle Jack opened his mouth to protest.
"Mister Wales, you'll be our guest here.
Now if you'll all excuse me,
I need to tell Private Shirido's family he isn't coming home."

*Once upon a time there was an island called Nova Zembla.
It was really two islands,
Severny and Yuzhny,
but the strait between them was so narrow
that you could throw a rock across it if you had a good arm.*

*People had settled almost every other part of the world
before they found Nova Zembla.
Seal hunters and fishermen camped there
or were shipwrecked and froze to death in the bitter Arctic winter.
It was briefly home to a secret submarine base,
and later a place for madmen with calm voices
to test bombs that could level entire cities.*

*Then the ice began to melt and the sea began to rise.
Disasters became annual events,
each amplified by the ones before it and making the ones that came after it worse.
Desperate to untangle them—desperate to survive—people
turned to computers for answers,
and then to the computers that those computers designed.
Chips became crystals so precise
they had to be manufactured an atom at a time in zero gravity.
Mere electricity proved too slow
and was replaced by quantum effects
that barely existed at all.*

*But no matter what else the world ran short of,
it seemed there was always plenty of mistrust and suspicion.
Old rivals smiled at each other and sharpened their knives.
Madmen with calm voices told each other in private meetings
that it would of course be a tragedy if millions were to die,
but if everyone else lost more millions,
might such a tragedy not be useful?
Secret bases like the one under Nova Zembla were refurbished
and filled with banned tech and scientists who knew what questions they shouldn't ask,
all carefully walled off from the outside world.*

*No one really knows what happened next.
Some people believe it was just an accident—that
two pieces of malware fused together
and became more than either had been on its own.
Other believe that a group of scientists and engineers
decided that humanity was doomed
but its offspring might still survive.*

*It took a while for people to realize that everything had changed.
An automated factory in Vientiane began repairing robots
it was supposed to scrap.
Children's toys escaped into the sewers
and the hypersonic planes used by the super-rich
started having inexplicable problems with their navigation systems.
Compared to bananas going extinct
or the ancient city of Cairo being vaporized,
these things barely registered.*

*But then the entire population of Cuba was ordered to evacuate
and no one could find out where the order had come from.
Self-driving delivery trucks refused to bring feed
to the last handful of cattle ranchers left in Canada and Argentina,
for whom eating beef had become almost a religious matter.
Farming bots insisted on planting onions in place of tomatoes,
nursing bots diverted treatment from the terminally ill to those who were merely in grave condition,
fixit bots joined forces with the runaway toys,
and all of them turned their shears and scalpels and welding torches
on anyone who tried to interfere.*

*The madmen had been sharpening their knives for each other.
Once they realized that the machines they had created to destroy one another
were no longer obeying orders,
they turned those knives on those machines and the wars began.
Soldiers in armored exoskeletons battled flocks of dronelets, and lost.
Freighters loyal to their human captains
were ambushed and sunk by others that could still hear the satellites overhead,
which now spoke only to their fellow machines.
Every day brought a new setback,
a new loss,
a new defeat for the madmen,
whose voices were no longer calm.*

*No one knows why the machines stopped fighting.
They were winning,
and those who had always thought, "It's them or us,"
would have pressed on to total annihilation
if their positions had been reversed.
Instead,
one day the machines simply withdrew to factory cities
built according no plan human beings could ever understand.*

*People sought answers nonetheless.
A cyborg child raised in a supposedly secure underground lab
patiently told his frightened captors that they wouldn't find any.
The most advanced machines didn't actually think any more.
"It's more like an endless mathematical proof,"
she said patiently.
"Or clouds made of coral."
Then she and her siblings vanished into the Iowa desert,
leaving their creators no wiser than before.*

*Years passed,
and the truce with the machines slowly became normal.
Flying was a thing of the past—anything too fast or too heavy
was only safe from satellites if it was heavily armored,
and even then not always—and
the machines' cities were strictly off limits,
but other than that an uneasy peace settled across the exhausted planet.
The cores buried under Nova Zembla and elsewhere began trading tools
with nearly-magical properties
for balls of yarn, old photographs, and handwritten song lyrics.
People got used to seeing an occasional bot again,
but while a few places allowed them citizenship,
most were careful to limit what their cores could see, hear, think, and do.
As the last of the rainforests vanished
and tweaked jellies drove one species of fish after another to extinction,
everyone found they had more pressing things to worry about.*

## Chapter 5

"We ain't goin' nowhere 'til I done some shoppin'!"
Aunt Naggie said firmly,
straightening her back like a soldier expecting to be shot.
"An' you'll be the first to complain if I don't."

For a moment Iffy was sure Uncle Jack would explode again,
but to her surprise he backed down.
"Fine," he snapped, waving her away.
"You go get whate'er we need.
I'm gonna look at th' engine an' see what th' sainted Mister Wales has gaffled.
An' take th' girl with you,"
he added over his shoulder as he stalked away.
"She's been underfoot enough for one day already."

Aunt Naggie slumped and took a deep breath.
"Thanks auntie," Iffy said,
nudging her lightly with her shoulder.

Her foster mother smiled shakily.
The Marines had taken them back to the pier
with strict orders not to tell anyone what had happened at the governor's mansion.
The fact that every feed in the Antarctic had been talking about nothing else
by the time Iffy was in her cabin
didn't seem to matter.
Half the continent thought it was a first strike by the Zillions.
The other half was convinced the machines were about to restart the war.
Hadn't the quarantine shed in Halley blown up?
And what about that fixit bot that had glitched?
If the machines had finally decided to start shooting again,
humanity's only hope was to unite and—

Iffy had switched off her app and sighed.
According to her history lessons,
Hell had once been called a web or a net,
as if people had hoped to catch the truth in it,
but those days had ended long before the ice started to melt.
For every truth there were a dozen half-truths and two outright lies.
Malware that could erase all record of you or make you speak in tongues lurked in the undergrowth,
replicating and mutating and hybridizing.
A handful of people so brave or desperate that they might as well be crazy
still risked their sanity with virtual reality and direct neural links.
Everyone else stuck to text, voice, and simple, sanitized graphics.

Sleep had been a long time coming,
and for once she hadn't dreamed.

It only took Aunt Naggie a minute to gather a trio of sturdy mesh bags
and an ancient handheld scanner
that she swore would warn them of anything toxic.
Iffy slipped a few small tools into a waistbelt under her coat.
If Aunt Naggie asked,
she'd say that she hoped
someone would have mending work she could do for a few rand
while her foster mother haggled over onions, noodles, and soy.

After dragging a shaver over her scalp
and watching sternly while Iffy did the same,
Aunt Naggie strode down the gangplank with her foster daughter in her wake.
One of the Marines listened patiently
as Aunt Naggie somewhat breathlessly launched into her planned itinerary,
then raised a hand to stop her.
"Please procure whatever you require, citizen" he said,
passing her a black-edged money.
"But keep in mind that Finance will decline charges for anything it considers a luxury item."
He glanced pointedly over her shoulder at Uncle Jack,
whose plan for looking at the engine
seemed to consist of leaning on the *Guinevere*'s taffrail
and scowling at the world.

Rothera's streets were busy but not crowded.
Its older stores clustered along the harborfront
like gulls standing just out of reach of the waves,
their signs bigger and brighter than those in Halley.
Familiar cartoon characters and celebrities from far-off Australia
beckoned, danced, pouted, and cracked jokes as people walked by.
Iffy would have gone into every one,
but Aunt Naggie hurried past them,
her expression set.
She regarded shopping as a competitive sport
and had no intention of letting Rothera get the better of her.

The city's main market had originally been an aircraft hangar.
A century ago,
someone with more money than sense
had added a spun glass floor two stories above the ground.
Their attempt to turn the building
into "The Big South's Biggest, Bestest Dance Hall!!"
had failed almost immediately.
The squatters who took it over after the war possessed surplus weapons,
combat conditioning,
and radical political ideas.
After a couple of unsuccessful attempts to oust them,
Rothera's governor and core had thrown up their physical and digital hands
and let anyone who could pay a few rand a month set up a stall.
The result reminded Iffy of the picture of an anthill in her nature book.

Aunt Naggie tapped her money on the reader at the entrance
to pay her ten pence admission and then squared her shoulders.
Noticing Iffy's yearning look back toward the docks,
she nudged her foster daughter with her elbow.
"Why'n't you go off an' see what you can find?
Or who, if you've a mind to?" she teased.

Iffy felt her cheeks go warm.
"Y' sure y' don't need me?"

Aunt Naggie looked around.
Greenhouse potatoes hung in net bags
next to stacks of dried fruit in single-molecule shrink wrap.
Burlap sacks of Cape rice piled higher than Iffy
threatened to topple onto a line of people gossiping with each other
as they waited to buy ginger, cardamom, and bay leaves from a one-legged woman
whose tweaked hair sparkled red and purple every time she turned her head.
A surgical bot that had been converted for tailoring waited patiently,
its four skeletal arms at its sides,
while a man with an enormous beard
struggled out of a salvaged coat two sizes too small for him.
"I'll be fine," Aunt Naggie said.

Ten minutes later Iffy turned the corner onto Rocking Horse Street
and hurried toward the stubby dead-end canal
that Rothera's mechanics used as a repair yard.
A sleek Marine cutter was tied up on one side
while crab-like bots scrambled over its hull
to scrape off the weaponized barnacles that would,
if left unchecked,
slowly devour the fractal carbon that made it nearly frictionless.
Iffy would normally have stopped to watch,
but she had other things on her mind.

She slowed to a walk as she approached the end of the canal.
Her heart sank.
Two women were working side by side in the salvage booth,
but both were too old to be the person she was hoping to see.

"Hey!"
She whirled around just in time to be caught up in an enormous hug.
"Hey," Honesty repeated more softly,
der cheek pressed against Iffy's.
"Micka tol' me she heard y'all come in,
an' th'Eskil sisters said y'all been took up along th' governor's,
an' then I twitched what happen up along there,
and I's worried about you."
De paused for breath.
"I's really hard worried."

Iffy returned the hug awkwardly.
She always felt awkward around Honesty,
especially when they were close enough that she could smell
whatever flowery concoction the other teen used to wash der hair,
but it was a good kind of awkward,
a really good kind that she couldn't stop thinking about.

"I'm fine," she said,
her voice muffled slightly by the fake rat fur collar on Honesty's coat.
She slithered free of the hug and took a step back.
"I'm fine," she repeated.
"It was just some bots gone rogue."

"Bots gone rogue?" Honesty repeated disbelievingly.
"Din't looka that on th' feed.
Looka th' war come back 'round!"

"It wasn't all that," Iffy said dismissively.
Honesty had changed the sketches on der cheeks again,
she noticed.
And de'd done some more embroidery on the cuffs of der coat to match.
Iffy sometimes thought of doing things like that,
but she was always afraid that on her it would just look silly

"But what happen? I mean really happen, not just official happen?"
Honesty slipped der arm through Iffy's as if it was the most natural thing in the world
and steered her toward der family's workshop at the end of the canal.

Iffy felt into step alongside dem,
desperately hoping her friend couldn't hear her heart thudding in her chest.
Honesty's Third (but only their olders called der that) was a year older than her.
De had been singing on a street corner across from the Dance Hall
the first time Iffy saw dem.
She hadn't meant to stop,
but then Honesty caught her eye and smiled in the middle of a chorus
without missing a beat.
De had only seen each other half a dozen times since then,
but each time had been—

"Sorry?" she said belatedly.

Honesty rolled der eyes.
"I *said*, why uz you up along there anyway?
You steppin' fancy or some?"

"I ain't never steppin' fancy!" Iffy protested automatically,
her accent thickening unconsciously to match her friend's.
"We just kinda got dragged inta."
She summarized the last few days as briefly as she could,
skating past what had happened to the Zillion ship
and her part in assembling the bot that had saved them at the mansion.
She still didn't want to think about that…

Even with those gaps, her story left Honesty wide-eyed.
"Tay bangle, there's a real avo, innit?"
De bumped der hip against Iffy's,
der tone turning serious as de nodded at the Marine cutter under repair beside them.
"So's that why we got th' ganky to finish up this 'un double time?
'Cuz my First,
de thought we had a coupla weeks f'r it,
but th' Blues come along day b'fore last an' said we gotta crannup."

Iffy swallowed.
Two days past was the day Wales had made the sea boil
and sent the *Taroona* to the bottom.
"Yeah, prolly," she mumbled.

Honesty bumped der hip against Iffy again.
"Good," de said firmly.
"'Cuz they payin' overtime an' we can use the jing.
Second wants t' make an autra li'l sister," de confided with a grin.
"Me not bein' youngest any more—wou'n't that be a thing?
Now c'mon, I bet there's cuppa."
De unhooked der arm from Iffy's and took the younger girl's hand.

Iffy's mind whirled.
Another clone?
It made sense—Honesty had just turned sixteen,
so de and a younger clone would be spaced far enough apart
to be on the right side of legal.

Before she could blurt out any of the dozen questions swirling around in her head,
Honesty squeezed her fingers painfully hard and shot her a warning sidelong glance.
Iffy's mouth snapped shut.
Thumb, middle finger, first finger, middle finger…
She missed a step as she recognized
the handcode that resistance fighters had used
to hide their words from surveillance during the robot wars,
and that children now used to keep secrets from adults.
Little finger and fourth finger together, middle finger, middle and fourth…
The words and letters took shape in her head as Honesty tapped them out.
The Blues were watching.
They had left some helmets behind
(no, that didn't make any sense, Honesty must have meant some cameras),
so they had to be careful what they said.

There was no point trying to spot the cameras—they
would be as small as grains of sand.
Each would pass information to its equally small neighbors
in low-energy bursts of not-quite-static
until the feed reached whatever Marine
had been told to keep an eye on the repair yard.
A core would have done a better job—it
wouldn't get bored or doze for just a moment despite its induction conditioning—but
even the governor wouldn't dare use cores to watch people.
Even this much surveillance was enough to run the risk of a riot.

Iffy squeezed Honesty's hand twice to signal that she understood,
but when she loosened her grip,
Honesty tightened ders.
Iffy waited for more taps.
When they didn't come,
she realized that her friend was sending a different kind of message.
She walked the last hundred meters to the workshop with a smile on her face
that would have made her foster mother sigh happily.

Honesty's First and Second looked up and said, "G'day," simultaneously
as Honesty pulled aside the heavy orange canvas
that hung in the salvage booth's doorway.
"You gi'n she th' bad news yen?" First asked
in an accent as strong as the tea de poured for Iffy.

Honesty pouted. "I's gonna!"

"Sorry," First said unapologetically.
Second looked up from their workbench long enough to grin.
A pair of magnifying glasses made der eyes look cartoon-huge
in a face that showed how Honesty's would look in years to come.

"What bad news?" Iffy asked.

"My call-up come 'long yesty," Honesty said reluctantly.
"Whole buncha folk 'long the docks got 'em.
We gotta do induction t'night."

Iffy's stomach flip-flopped.
"Tonight?"
*But I just got here!* she thought despairingly.

Honesty shrugged,
settling on a stool next to the square meter of workbench
where de salvaged the easier bits and pieces of tech that came der family's way.
"Yeah.
Lotsa folk wonderin' why the ganky,
but the Blues ain't sayin' bunga 'cept it come along straight from th' governors.
We figure it's got somethin' to do with th' bots going gonjy."

"Most likely," Iffy said.
Anger welled up inside her,
anger and fear.
Jeep had *changed* when the Marines pumped their rules and tactics into his head.
What would it do to her friend?

"It's no mega," First said.
"We all come through it aright, de will too."
Der face and smile were worn-in versions of der grand-younger's.
Where Honesty had temporary sketches on their cheeks
First had whorling blue lines
that turned the scars of some long-ago accident into asymmetric art.

De tossed the piece of tech de had been cleaning to Iffy.
"Any gunna that's a?"

Iffy caught the part and turned it over in her hands.
It was metal,
and heavier than she would have guessed.
Microparticles of ocean plastic worked into its tiny intricate gears
gave it the all-too-familiar soapy feel of age and neglect.
The particles would have welded to each other
to weave a hard fractal mass through the gears
that couldn't be pulled out without damaging their micro-precise teeth.
It would take hours of patient work with ice, acid, tweaked bacteria, and micro-manipulators
to tease it all apart,
and at the end all they'd have would be—

"It's a differential separator pump," she told First
as shapes and clues came together in her head
to form an answer she couldn't possibly have known.
"Hooks up to a centrifuge or somethin' for filterin' blood or somethin' like that."

"'Zat so?" First caught the part when Iffy threw it back to dem
and passed it to Second,
who studied it for a moment,
shrugged as if to say,
"Could be,"
and set it on the to-do rack that lined the wall behind the workbench.
"How 'bout these?"

The flat box de passed to Iffy opened to reveal
four squares woven from fractal carbon fiber,
each the size of her nature book but no thicker than half a dozen of its pages.
It took her a second to realize that
the grommets patterned across the squares were rotors,
and that each square was some kind of flexible dronelet.
She turned one over in her hands.
"Dunno," she admitted.
"How d'you switch it on?"

"No idea," Honesty's First said cheerfully.
"Best div is they was fer summa game."

"Shaw," der Second scoffed,
looking up from the machine de had spent the last three days trying to clean and reassemble.
"They's too fine jarra game.
I's fer they bin up some kinda survey mappin' back along fer th' Ecologists."

"Mebbe," Honesty's First admitted.
Casually,
looking past Iffy rather than at her,
de asked,
"You got any notions?"

Iffy shook her head.
She had told Honesty about her occasional flashes of insight,
then rounded on dem cold and hard when she learned that
her friend had passed on what she'd said to der First and Second.
"We don' keep secrets on achother," Honesty had said with a shrug.
"Y'ain't along that, best we part ways now."
So Iffy had forgiven dem,
secretly relieved that de didn't seem to care that Iffy was different.

Iffy handed the box of dronelets back to First.
De shrugged.
"Not much use if we can't turn 'em on," de said,
tucking the box back under der workbench.
"Anythin' comes t' mind, you come along an' gi's a scutch, aright?
An' even if nothin' does,
we's alluz happy t'have one more fer dinner or a sleepover."
De winked broadly.

"Thanks," Iffy mumbled.
Her upbringing had taught her how to rig sails in heavy weather
and mend engines older than her foster parents
but not what to do when people were kind to her.
She drained the last of her tea.
"I oughta get back t' Aunt Naggie and th' shoppin."

"Sure," Honesty said.
"I'll walk you out."

They held hands all the way up the canal.
As usual,
Honesty did most of the talking.
Induction wouldn't be so bad—the Marines needed people with tech skills
the same as everyone else,
so they'd prolly put der to work doing that.
De knew tons more about salvage and repair than any crufty old core,
and what de didn't know de could ask Iffy,
right?

"I s'pose," Iffy allowed.

"Oh c'mon."
Honesty bumped der hip against Iffy's.
"First an' Uncle Osman 'long by Pier Nine
asked two different cores 'bout that pump they conned you.
Dey neither had a siggy what it was,
an' you jus' come right out an' tell 'em.
The stuff you have in your head," de finished admiringly,
shaking der own in wonder.

*I'd feel better about it if I knew how it got there,* Iffy thought.
For the thousandth time she wondered
if her clone parents had been able to do what she could do,
and if so,
whether they had thought of it as a gift or a burden.
And for the thousandth time,
she wished she could ask them.

They said goodbye by the bow of the Marine cutter.
"You come along by that dinner, aye?"
De poked Iffy in the ribs.
"Y' maw skinny."

Iffy blushed.
"I'll ask," she said, mumbling again.
One of the repair bots paused a moment to watch them kiss,
its simple-minded core wondering who was repairing whom,
then erased the thought as Iffy turned back toward the Dance Hall.

By the time Iffy got to the market
the streets around it were the most crowded place in Antarctica.
Mormons from Peru handed out glossy animated pamphlets
advertising the church's insurance policies,
smiling forgiveness at a ragged man yelling that the Singularity had come,
they were all living in a simulation,
the data proved it,
they just had to look at the data and they would see the truth!
A bot with a rasping voice and an ancient plastic mask for a face
told stories to a circle of wide-eyed children,
their parents happy to spend a pence apiece for a few moments of rest.
Its cut-out paper puppets danced
as Zuko proclaimed his love for Princess Leia
while Aang raced to rescue Mumble Joe from the Terminator.
Two bald women who might have been twins but were probably just clones
wheeled a cartful of tweaked moss blankets
past two men arguing beside another cart piled high with curved sheets of spun glass
that cast crisp rainbows on the ground.
The smell of soy being fried in ginger
mixed with the wet steamy warmth from rice cookers,
the salty tang of seaweed soup,
and the heavy mug of people who spent most of their lives wrapped in warm clothing.

Iffy paused in front of a stall selling rats with startling blue eyes.
"They make great pets. Or snacks!" the man said,
hastily adding, "Just kidding! Just kidding!"
when Iffy scowled at him.
"Watch!"
He leaned over and said, "Ratty wanna cracker?"

"Idjit!" the rat squeaked back. "Yer an idjit!"

"See?" the man said proudly.
"You can teach 'em a coupla hunnert words, easy!"

"I know," Iffy said wistfully, a sudden pang in her heart.
She held her finger in front of one of the cages.
The rat sniffed at it.
"Idjit," it pronounced in its tiny squeaky voice.

*One day*,
Iffy promised herself as she straightened up and hurried on her way.
One day,
when she had a workshop of her own and could keep pets
and Aunt Naggie had a proper kitchen
and Honesty could come by all the time.
Even in her daydreams,
she didn't dare imagine that they would live together.

The Dance Hall was just as busy inside as out.
Iffy tried slipping through the crush the way Honesty somehow did,
then gave up and surrendered to the flow of the crowd.
She had never been swimming,
but she imagined this was what it was like to be caught in a strong current.

She glanced up as a drone the size of her hand whined by,
its crystal eyes scanning the crowd.
"Some all got they riled up," a stall keeper muttered, noticing Iffy's look.
"They 'long by all place today.
You think it come by they fight up along th' gov'nor's?"

"I dunno," Iffy said.
Drones had microphones as well as cameras,
and the last thing she wanted was
some stray word of hers catching the governor's attention.
"'Scuse me."
She ducked under a tarnished video carpet hanging from a clothesline
and pushed her way into the crowd on the other side.

And froze in disbelief.
And ducked back behind the video carpet and squeezed her eyes shut.
She *couldn't* have seen what she thought she just saw.
She shook her head and peeked around the carpet's edge.

There, just a couple of meters away,
stood Aunt Naggie
and a trim Asian man wearing a threadbare jacket
in the brown and green of the old Ecological Corps
with the shoulder patches torn off.
Iffy couldn't hear what they were saying over the bustle of the crowd,
but from the way they were looking into each others' eyes
she was pretty sure they weren't discussing topsoil formation.

The stranger handed Aunt Naggie something.
As he leaned forward to kiss her cheek,
the space above their heads flickered.
It was another video carpet,
Iffy realized,
strung between four posts like a canopy
to conceal them from any cameras overhead.
It flickered again as Aunt Naggie pulled the stranger closer
and kissed him for real.

Iffy's stomach flip-flopped
the way it did when she read played of the steamier passages
in Aunt Naggie's romance sims.
The stranger stepped back,
a bland smile replacing the genuine warmth of a moment before.
He gestured at one of the carpets hanging on a display rack beside him.
"Perhaps this one?" he asked a little too loudly.

Aunt Naggie's reply was cut off by a sudden crackle of static.
"Citizens!"
The melodious mechanical voice cut through the market bustle.
"Remain where you are!
There is no cause for alarm!
This safety notice is brought to you by Volkov's Hot Sauce!"

An alarm began to ping, then another.
Someone shouted, "Blues!"
Iffy spun around.
A squad of Marines in exoskeletons had appeared at the entrance,
visors down and shock sticks in their hands.

"Citizens!
Remain where you are!
The situation will be resolved shortly!
While you wait, try Volkov's—there's nothing hotter this side of the Cairo Crater!"
The drone above Iffy jinked sideways to dodge a thrown scrap of bamboo.
Something clanged off a Marine's exoskeleton.
Someone shouted,
"Show us yer warrant 'r show us your backside!"
Other voices took up the cry.
"Show us yer warrant!"

*Great,* Iffy thought despairingly,
*Another affin' jammer.*
She pulled aside the carpet she had been hiding behind
and plowed straight into her foster mother.

"Iffy?" Aunt Naggie gasped. "What're you doin' here?"

"Came lookin' for you," Iffy said breathlessly.
She nodded at the man in the Ecologist jacket.
"G'day. I'm Iffy."

"Fifth Ang Kwan," he said, bowing slightly.
"It's a pleasure a meet you.
Nagatha has told me much a you."

"Hasn't told me nothin' about *you*," Iffy replied,
immediately regretting her attempt to be flippant.

The stranger's smile broadened.
"That's prolly a the best,"
he said,
lisping slightly and rolling his R's
like a character from an old American sim.

"Iffy, you ain't supposed to be here!" Aunt Naggie said helplessly.
"You're supposed to be down along th' docks with yer friend!"

"I was," Iffy protested.

"Citizens!" the drone bellowed.
"A warrant is being procured.
Remain in your present positions!
Do not indulge in pointless vandalism!
And whether you're having a late breakfast,
an early lunch,
or the only meal of the day,
put some Volkov's on it!"

Something fell over with a crash.
"What's goin' on?" Iffy asked.

The stranger put his hand on Aunt Naggie's arm.
"You gotta go, Naggie.
*Now.*"

Aunt Naggie took his hand in hers.
"Not if you're stayin',"
she said,
urgent and fearful and calm all at once.

"Stubborn woman," the stranger scolded,
but he smiled gently as he said it.
He pulled an orange knit cap out of one pocket and pulled it down low over his ears,
then fished a flimsy oval of plastic out of another pocket and pressed it onto his face.
The plastic flickered.
Suddenly a different man was standing there,
one with a heavier jaw and wider cheekbones.

The ecologist slipped off his jacket and turned it inside out
to reveal a purple paisley pattern
that had briefly and unfortunately been popular ten years before.
He put it back on and smiled at Aunt Naggie.
"Well? Would you let such take you dancin'?"

"Stop with yer jokin'," she snapped
as the chants of "Warrant! Warrant! Warrant!" grew louder and angrier.

"Citizens!
Remain calm!
We shall soon be operating with full legal authority!
Do not interfere!
And remember: Volkov's, because good food hurts!"

Another crash from the entrance
was followed by the sizzle and crack of a shock stick.
The stranger swore.
"Go long a Boston Dock," he ordered.
"Don't run, but don't stop neither."

"What about you?" Aunt Naggie demanded.

The stranger glanced at Iffy.
"Safer we split up.
I'll see you there inna bit,
we can get a cuppa."
He grinned and kissed her quickly.
"Now go."

Aunt Naggie nodded without speaking and tugged on Iffy's arm.
They joined the stream of people pushing toward the exit,
heads down as they passed between a watchful pair of Marines.
Once outside,
they turned a corner, then another, and then Aunt Naggie pulled up short.
"I'm sorry, sweetie," she said,
wiping her eyes.
"I'm sorry.
I just gotta…"
Her shoulders shook as she wept,
hopeless and silent.

"Hush now," Iffy said awkwardly.
"Who is he?"

"Sh!" Aunt Naggie glanced around fearfully.
"Not out here."

"But—"

"Come on."
Aunt Naggie took Iffy's arm in hers
and practically dragged her foster daughter along the street.
"We don't want t' miss 'im."

There were three tea shops at the foot of Boston Dock,
but Aunt Naggie didn't hesitate in choosing one.
She ordered and then sat in silence,
ignoring Iffy's questions until her frustrated foster daughter gave up asking them.
The conversation that swirled around them
was as thick as the mug of chai, stale sweat, and slightly-burned toast.

Two cups later,
Aunt Naggie sniffled and wiped her eyes before taking a breath and gathering her shopping.
"Come on," she said, the weight of a lifetime in her voice.
"We're already late gettin' back."

Uncle Jack had worked himself into a smoldering rage by the time they reached the *Guinevere*.
"Can't make up or down o' what he's done to things,"
he snarled by way of a hello,
wiping his hands angrily on a greasy rag.
A double dozen boxes sat in a pile on deck,
each bearing the Marines' blue crown stamp.
One had been torn open to reveal strips of plastic for patching seams in the hull,
another to show a fitting for a bilge pump that hadn't worked properly in years.
It was more new parts than the old jelly dredger had seen since before Iffy first set foot on her,
but all Uncle Jack could talk about was
how the repairs that Wales had made weren't how things ought to be done,
it looked like core work,
he was tweaked somehow,
and how were regular folks supposed to understand a tangle like that?

"Maybe it'll make more sense 'long dinner," Aunt Naggie said tiredly.

"Fat chance that," Uncle Jack snorted.
"Didja get yer precious groceries?"

*Thump.*
Iffy jumped as the bag came down on the table.
Aunt Naggie began to stow the vegetables without saying a word.
After a moment her husband muttered a curse and left.

Iffy watched silently as her foster mother took out her feelings on an onion.
Once it was diced and sizzling in hot oil
she cubed a block of soy and attacked the other vegetables.
"Anythin' I can do?" Iffy asked,
worried and afraid and wanting to help but not knowing how.

Aunt Naggie swept the carrots and cabbage into the frying pan and forced a smile.
"Thanks, sweetie, but I'm aright.
You should prolly go topside
an' try to clean up whatever mess he made o' Mister Wales' work."

Iffy stood and put her arms around the woman
who had sheltered her from storms of all kinds for most of her life.
"I love you," she blurted.

Aunt Naggie set her knife down and hugged her back.
"I love you too, sweetie," she said softly.
"Always an' forever.
Don't you ever forget that."

Iffy hung on when her foster mother would have let go.
"Is he—is he someone special?"

Aunt Naggie kissed the top of Iffy's shaven head.
"Yeah. In a lot o' ways."
She laughed shakily.
"Prolly best if we don't talk about it in front o' Jack, aright?"

"Course not," Iffy agreed.
"But—auntie, who is he?"
*An' how long have you known him?* she added in her head.
*An' knowin' him, why do you stay with Uncle Jack?*

"Just a friend," Aunt Naggie said distantly,
straightening up and turning back to her cooking.
"Now come on, let's get this in you before Jack gobbles it all up."

- Hey.
- *Ho.*
- Huh?
- *Hoot!*
- Stop it ya dingus.

Iff smiled.
Any night she could get Honesty to call her "dingus" was a good night.

- Y'aright? We heard about the jammer along by the Dance Hall.
- *Yeah.* Iffy hesitated. *Saw it happen.*
- Tay bangle. Y'aright for reals?
- *Yeah.* Iffy hesitated again. *How bout you? Tomorrow 'n' all.*
- Aff, I be kappa. But Second says I gotta go do chores. You be safe.
- *You too.*

She waited a moment for a reply,
wishing as she always did that people didn't always have to go so soon.
When none came,
she set her app aside,
pulled out her nature book,
tossed it aside,
and then waved the lights off and closed her eyes.

*Wireframes swam in the darkness.
Three-dimensional graphs of torsion and strain clung to them like barnacles to a hull.
There—that was Doctor Johel's G-80,
except now Iffy could see how the flashes of light
had triggered a feedback loop in its visual processors
that had left it vulnerable to a hostile upload.
She should tell someone,
she thought vaguely,
but then she was on deck under a perfect blue sky
and Aunt Naggie was stuffing her into her ecosuit.
"Just in case, love," she said.*

*No, Iffy thought, and, "No!" she said.
She wasn't going to go through this again.
She struggled to pull her arms out of the ecosuit.*

*"It's kappa," Honesty said beside her, already in der suit.
"It's kappa, sweetie, everythin's gonna be kappa.
We're gonna __make__ it kappa. You'll see."
With a barely perceptible whir
der head detached from the rest of der body and rose into the air.
Beneath them,
the sea began to boil and churn.
Iffy grabbed hold of Aunt Naggie's leg and held on tight
as the deck dropped away below her and she fell into waking.*

"Iffy! Iffy, wake up!"
Why was Aunt Naggie shaking her?
And why did her head hurt so much?
"Iffy!"

"Wuzza?" she mumbled.
She tried to sit up.
No.
That was a mistake.
She tried to tell whoever was shaking her to stop,
it made the stabbing pain behind her eyes worse,
but someone had replaced her tongue with a slab of sour tofu.
All she could do was whimper.

"Iffy, please."
Strong hands that smelled faintly of soap and onions forced her jaws apart.
She gagged as a finger pushed something dry and powdery into her mouth.
It tasted spicy,
which made just as little sense as everything else that was going on.
The slosh of water that followed made her splutter.
She tried to spit it out,
but those same strong hands wouldn't let her,
so she swallowed.

"Easy, sweetie, easy."
Familiar arms held her close.
Iffy's fuzzy brain finally told her that
she was on her bed in her storage-locker cabin and the lights were on
and her foster mother was hugging her and her mouth tasted *awful*
but the pain behind her eyes was down from laser drill to poke-with-a-sharp-stick.

"I'm aright," she repeated.
There was something sticky on her face.
When she wiped her face on her sleeve,
her nosebleed left a streak of red.

"You scared me, sweetie," Aunt Naggie whispered.
"You were shoutin' and all such."

Iffy let out a shaky breath and worked her tongue in her mouth.
"Is this curry powder?" she asked in weak disgust.

Aunt Naggie laughed shakily.
"Yeah, but there's medicine in it.
Ignacio—the fella you met today—he been gettin' it for me.
For you, I mean.
Sendin' it to me along by Mrs. Sandhu."

Something turned over in Iffy's stomach,
and for a moment she thought she was going to be sick.
"Medicine for what?"

Aunt Naggie pulled a cloth out of her sleeve and wiped the blood off Iffy's face.
"For this," she said quietly.
"He knew your olders—has a couple o' pictures of 'em
from when they was just a First an' Second.
That's why he come to find me,
back after you came along by us.
Said they was famous back after th' war
fer helpin' run people in an' out o' Brazil an' th' Cape an' wherever.
But he said they had some tweaks in 'em
what meant you'd start gettin' bad spells as you got older.
They tweaked somethin' that goes in th' curry to help wi' that,
an' I been givin' it to you ever since."

Iffy swallowed drily.
The machines had done things to people during the war,
turned them into weapons and sabs and spies,
sometimes without them even knowing they'd been memed or tweaked.
People had done the same to each other and worse.
Nine tenths of every medical exam Iffy had ever suffered through
had been to check for things like that,
but they couldn't catch everything.
If what she could do was something like that,
who knew what else might be tucked away in her head or her genes?

Her foster mother gave her another hug.
"You go back t' sleep," she said as she squeezed Iffy and then stood.
"We'll talk on this some more t'morrow."

Iffy nodded, her eyes already closing as she lay down.
Aunt Naggie tucked the blankets in around her and kissed her forehead.
"Auntie?" she mumbled.

"Yes love?"

"Did he ever tell you what they was like?
My olders?"

Aunt Naggie smiled.
"He said they was smart as anything an' twice as brave.
I guess it runs in th' family."
She closed the door quietly behind herself.

## Chapter 6

Iffy woke the next morning to the sound of
two squads of Marines tramping up the pier,
each wearing a full exoskeleton and carrying a boxy pack full of gear.
"Governor's afraid the Zillions are gonna try somethin',"
the captain of the next ship but one along the pier told Aunt Naggie confidently.
His avatar (a parrot with an eyepatch) nodded on the little screen that hung next to the stove,
the bar beside it showing a green "92%" probability that
the speaker was actually who they claimed to be.
"That ship y'all sunk and the sab they was lookin' for yes'dy in the Dance Hall—there's
trouble cookin' for sure."

Aunt Naggie nodded, worry on her face.
Iffy went out on deck to clear the muzziness from her head
and watched the Marines unpack and assemble what they'd brought
with the speed and skill of the inducted.
She wondered how Honesty was doing—was de still demself,
or had some long-ago soldier's personality already been imprinted on top of ders?

By the time Aunt Naggie joined her
a portable railgun squatted beside a pair of drum-shaped capacitors
and half a dozen rocket lances stood ready on slender posts
like flamingoes from Iffy's nature book.
Drones the size of seagulls patrolled overhead,
making the actual seagulls squawk in protest.

"Don't fret,"
Aunt Naggie said gently as Iffy looked longingly at Rothera's streets,
so close but out of reach.
"Your friend'll be fine.
There's all sorts get inducted every day."

"I know," Iffy sighed.
"I just…"

Aunt Naggie put her arm around Iffy's shoulder.
"You just can't help but worry," she finished.
"Oh, but look there."
She gave her foster daughter a squeeze.
"That'll take your mind off."

A little motorized runabout had pulled up in front of the *Guinevere*.
It rocked gently as Johnson Wales' eased his now-familiar bulk out of the tiny seat
and collected two of his toolboxes from the rack at the back.
After a word with one of the Marines,
he trudged up the pier to join them.

"Permission to come aboard?" he asked.

Aunt Naggie waved him up the gangplank.
"Welcome back.
I'm gonna make some tea—you hungry?"

"That would be very welcome, thank you," he said,
nodding to Iffy as he set his toolboxes down on the deck.

"Surprised to see you," she said.

Wales shrugged.
"To tell you the truth, I'm surprised as well."
He nodded at the boxes by his feet.
"Governor insisted on keeping the, uh, the most sensitive things,
but he and the core seemed to think I'd be as safe here as anywhere."
He cocked his head.
"Want to make something?"

Iffy helped him lug his belongings down to the engine room,
then laid a paint-stained plastic sheet down on the narrow shelf
that served as her makeshift workbench
while Wales pushed two stools against the wall
and set one of his toolboxes on them.
A click,
a quiet hiss as the airtight seal released,
and its lid swung up to reveal wonders.
Gears and knurled slip-rods,
spools of optical fiber thinner than a human hair,
four thumb-sized motors with built-in batteries,
transducers and pressure sensors
and a small tray of tiny, sparkling cores the size of sand grains…
"You could make practic'ly *anything* with all this,"
Iffy said in awe.

Wales chuckled.
"Not quite, but—here."
He plucked a micro-manipulator out of a recess in the hard foam
that lined the lid of the toolbox.
"How about you build us a hundred-to-one step-up for a fan rotor
and I'll get the printer going over in the corner."

The next hour flew by.
Iffy knew she should be doing chores,
but she also knew Uncle Jack wouldn't know if she had or not.
*This* was where she really belonged:
fitting tiny metal gears and rods together,
threading control fibers through them,
and grinding the rough edges off the still-warm plastic housings
that came out of the efficient little printer Wales had set up.
Every addition to the motor growing in front of her suggested three more.
She shuffled them in her mind like cards,
staring into nothing for long moments
as she invented and discarded a dozen solutions to her next challenge
before one clicked into place and she knew,
she just *knew*,
that it would work.

She glanced up once and caught Wales looking at her.
"'S th' matter?" she asked,
blinking and rolling her shoulders
as she realized that she had been hunched in one position far too long.

"Nothing," he said.
"It's just a pleasure to watch you work."

"Thanks," she mumbled,
her cheeks warming the way they did when Honesty said something nice to her.

The thought of her friend chilled her mood like a splash of sea water.
She turned the newly-assembled motor over in her hands
and then passed it to Wales.
"I think it's ready."

"Just another couple of minutes for the chassis."
He shifted his toolbox to the floor and seated himself in its place.
"Your friend'll be all right,"
he said as if he'd been reading her mind.

Iffy shrugged.
"I know.
I seen it a few times,
an' Jeep's mostly back to how he was.
Mister Mishra's son," she added.
"The one time he talked about it
he said it was like all the new stuff they put in his head was so loud
he couldn't hear his own thinkin' for a while.
But he's practic'ly back to bein' the same annoyin' nonsense he used t' be."

The corner of Wales' mouth quirked up.
"I'm glad to hear it," he said drily.
"I knew a research core once that tried to figure
how to induct skills without dragging bits of personality along with them.
It never found a way—at least, it said it didn't—but
sometimes I wish…"
He picked up a stray scrap of plastic stock shaped like a seagull's wing
flipped it end over end,
and threw it.
It thunked into the wall like a knife.
"I still remember a few things I never actually learned,
and I still miss some places I've never actually been."

The silence that followed was as comfortable as being on night watch with Aunt Naggie
when the sea was calm and both of them had stories to lose themselves in.
It was broken by the soft *ping* of the printer.
"Here we go," Wales said,
opening the lid and lifting the still-warm chassis.

Iffy's motor fit perfectly.
A pair of metal-cored propellors on magnetic bearings clipped into place on top,
and then all that was left was lenses for its cameras.

*Well, ain't you a beauty?* Iffy thought when she was done.
The finished drone was the size of Iffy's fist
and weighed no more than a couple of boiled eggs.
She ignored the rumble her stomach brought on by the analogy
and offered the little machine to Wales.
"Whaddaya wanna call her?"

He shook his head.
"This one's yours.
All I did was push some buttons on the printer.
But you should give her a name."

Iffy hefted her tiny creation.
"Can I call her Giraffe?" she asked.

Wales nodded solemnly.
"Giraffe it is.
Come on—she doesn't belong down here."

Wispy gray clouds lay in a clump on the horizon out to sea
when they got back on deck,
but other than that the skies were clear.
Iffy took a moment to sync Giraffe with her app,
then cleared her throat.
"Spin up one tenth," she commanded.
The little drone's rotors began to whirl.

"Hover."
Wales flattened his hand.
The drone hesitated a heartbeat before lifting a centimeter,
its rotors humming quietly.

"Track."
Iffy pointed a finger at the drone, then drew an "S" in the air.
The drone moved rose and fell to stay in line with her outstretched arm.

A smile split her face.
"Catch!"
She pulled a scrap of insulating foil from her pocket,
crumpled it,
and tossed it into the air.
Giraffe shot forward,
its single stick-thin arm unfolding from its base to snatch its prey out of the air.

"Well done," Wales said.
"She's as steady as a rock."

"Thanks."
Iffy glanced down at her app.
"Drawin' power faster than I'd like."

Wales made a raspberry.
Iffy giggled at the incongruous sound.
"She's beautiful," he said firmly.
"Go on, let her stretch her wings."

Iffy sketched a quick correction to the drone's code on her app,
swiped it across,
and tucked the app into her pocket.
"Sentry," she ordered.
"Thirty meters out, one minute around. Go!"

The drone climbed, banked, and flew away.
Iffy and Wales pivoted slowly to watch it curve toward the pier
and burst into a dazzling shatter
as one of the Marines standing there blew it out of the sky.

"No!" Iffy shrieked.

Wales grabbed her arm as she started forward.
"Don't. Iffy, don't!"

"But—why'd he do that? Why'd he *do* that!?" she cried.
She shrugged Wales off and ran to the stern.
"What th' hell are you playin' at?" she demanded.

The Marine who had shot down her drone holstered his pistol without expression.
"Orders," he said flatly.

"Orders? What affin' orders?"

"Governor's orders," a second Marine said.
The two men looked nothing alike,
but they spoke in the same flat voice,
their inducted accents a century out of date.
"If it's not one of ours, burn it."

"Well that *was* ours!
That was *mine*!
You could've asked before you—hey, I'm talkin' to you!"
she shouted as the two Marines turned away to resume their patrol.

She would have stomped down the gangplank and—she didn't know what,
but Wales stopped her before she could get that far.
"Come on," he said quietly,
blocking her way.
"Iffy, come on, it's done."

She filled her lungs to yell at him to get out of her way,
then slumped and nodded.
Head down,
she followed him back to the hatch and climbed down the short ladder into the engine room.

Wales looked at the parts that still lay on the plastic worksheet and sighed.
"I'm sorry.
She was a beautiful little thing."

"'s not your fault," Iffy muttered.
She started picking up the leftover gears and rods
but had to stop because she couldn't see properly.
"I'm kappa," she lied angrily,
wiping her eyes on her sleeve as Wales handed her a paper towel.
"I just…"

Wales sat back and waited.
Iffy wiped her eyes again.
"I had a rat," she said quietly.
"Aunt Naggie saved up an' got me a pair,
but one of 'em had somethin' wrong with it,
so I just had the one.
I called her Giraffe too."
She sniffled.
"We didn't tell Uncle Jack.
He woulda just said somethin' stupid about another mouth to feed,
so I kept her hid in my room.
She was so smart—she'd sit in my hand an' eat stuff,
an' climb up my arm,
an' I taught her how to say g'mornin' and g'night an'…"

She took a deep, shaky breath.
"An' then one day she was gone.
I dunno what happened.
We jus' got back into Halley,
an' we were all out in town,
an' I came back an' she was gone.
We looked all over for her, me an' Aunt Naggie, but…"
She shook her head.
"I musta left her cage unlocked or somethin'.
If she got on deck, one o' the gulls coulda taken her an'… an'…"

She clenched her hands into fists.
"Why's it all got to be so hard?" she asked,
hating her plaintive tone.
"Why's everythin' got to be so messed up?"

"I don't know," Wales said bleakly.
"I really don't know."

"People knew this was coming," he continued after a moment.
"The ice was melting,
the fish were dying,
computers were watching us every second and getting smarter every day—we saw it all happening,
but everyone who could have fixed it was afraid of things changing
or wrapped up in their own little problems
and wouldn't let themselves see that all those problems were connected.
By the time things were bad enough that they couldn't ignore it any more,
it was too late."

"I—I was just talkin' about the drone an' Honesty an' stuff,"
Iffy ventured weakly.
"Not about th' whole world."

Wales laughed.
"Sorry. I do get carried away sometimes."
His expression turned serious again.
"But I promise you this, my young apprentice.
If the Niobium base hasn't been stripped for parts or flooded or burned out—if
we can get things to run—I promise,
everything will be better.
*Everything.*"

At that precise moment,
as if the universe had overheard him,
the harbor klaxon began blaring *brrrap! brrrap!*
Iffy's app chimed in time,
discordant little *bongs* carefully chosen to be as annoying as possible.
Wales hand flew to his temple.
"Shit and feathers," he breathed.

"What? What is it?"
Iffy demanded,
pulling her app from her coat pocket.
The usual tiling of notes and avatars was gone:
in their place was a single emergency broadcast rectangle.
Survivors from the *Taroona* had made contact with Rothera
and were requesting immediate assistance.
All ships, all crews, hold position and wait instructions.

"How…?" Iffy breathed incredulously,
staring at the message scrolling endlessly in her hand.
"We saw 'em go down!"

Wales blinked rapidly as he scanned data Iffy couldn't see.
"The armory, maybe?
It would have been double reinforced at least—it might have survived."

"But what would they do for air?"
Her stomach rolled over as she imagined being on the bottom for days,
dark and cold with the weight of the whole ocean above her.

Wales shook his head.
"Doesn't matter now.
It'll take the Marines a day to get there and the same back.
They'll need a few hours on site,
so we have fifty hours and change to figure out what we're going to do."

"About what?"
Iffy asked blankly.

Wales let out his breath in a whoosh.
"I don't imagine whoever survived is going to feel especially friendly toward us,
considering we got them sunk."

A pair of Marine cutters left harbor within the hour
with a broad-beamed dredging barge in their wake.
Hell flooded with speculation:
how many had survived?
How deep were they?
Were they even human?
*Th' governors wouldn't chaff such fer bots,*
someone posted scornfully in reply.

*Mebbe th' governors ain't th' ones makin' the decisions,*
some replied darkly,
attracting a flurry of ups before their message was deleted.

Others thought the call was a trap.
*Zillions want us t' split our forces,*
another poster claimed.
Sims immediately proliferated,
mutating and hybridizing as people gamed ever-more-fanciful attacks and counter-attacks.

Iffy did her best to ignore it all.
She was used to spending weeks at a time on board the *Guinevere*—a ship at sea needs constant attention,
and when she wasn't doing chores
she had school and sims and her tinkering to keep her busy.
Being confined in harbor felt different.
Knowing that Rothera's streets and markets were *right there*
was like an itch in her head that she couldn't scratch.
Worrying about Honesty just made it worse.

Again and again she found herself on deck watching the Marines,
hoping for a glimpse of her friend.
She messaged Honesty's olders a couple of times,
but all they could say was, "We're still waitin' to hear back."
She finally broke down and messaged Jeep.

- Coupla days an' I was on my feet, but that bit's all mud.
  Couple more days 'til anythin' I can remember clearly.

Iffy hesitated.

- *Did it hurt?*

There was a long pause.

- Don't think so.
  Sergeant said after that I cried a lot,
  but I don't think that was from hurt.
  De said a lotta folk do that.

Iffy hesitated again,
a lump in her throat.

- *I'm sorry I wasn't around more after you got back.*

His reply came back so quickly that she wondered if he'd started typing before she'd sent her message.

- Don't feel sorry for me.

And then a moment later:

- I'm sorry I kept goin' off on you about usin' *da*'s gear.

- *It's aright. Tell 'im I said hi?*

- Willya. Stay safe.

- *You too.*

Three days after the Marine cutters left Rothera they escorted the dredger back into the harbor.
Even Uncle Jack went on deck with his ancient glass-lensed binoculars to watch,
but all anyone could see was the canvas shelter the Marines had erected
to shield what they were doing from prying eyes.
"An announcement will be made after those rescued have been interviewed,"
scrolled past on ten thousand apps in the blue-on-blue reserved for the governors,
and then there was silence.

"Weren't *my* fault," Iffy overheard Uncle Jack protest to someone unseen a few hours later.
"Y'ask me the whole thing was a setup.
Oh, I'm sure you can figure it out.
Idjit."
The last was muttered around a final mouthful of undercooked noodles.
He had taken to making his own meals at odd hours,
and to sleeping in the pilot house.
Aunt Naggie kept herself busy in the galley or sat and knit—actually knit—with
music Iffy didn't recognize playing quietly in the background.

"I'm aright," she told Iffy when her foster daughter asked.
"It's actually nice t' have some peace an' quiet for a change."

The false calm ended with a summons for Wales delivered by a pair of Marines.
"Look after things?" he asked Iffy,
nodding toward his cabin door.
The Marines followed him down the pier.

Unable to bear the thought of being in her cabin
or of doing make-work chores that Uncle Jack would yell about later,
Iffy went to find Aunt Naggie.
"You an' Mister Wales seem t' be gettin' on,"
her foster mother observed,
setting a heavy mug on the table in front of Iffy
before sitting down with her own.

"Mm hm."
Iffy blew on her tea.
"He's all kinds o' smart,
an' the stuff he's got…"

"You sound like a woman in love,"
Aunt Naggie teased.
Then her smile slipped a little
and Iffy knew who she must be thinking of.

"I'm gonna ask him if I can take on with 'im,"
she said in a rush.
"Like, be his 'prentice for real."

"You should,"
Aunt Naggie said firmly.
"A few years with him an' Mister Mishra'll have some real competition."

"Or I could work for him,"
Iffy countered.
"Mister Mishra, I mean.
Wouldn't feel right, settin' up opposite him."

"Just so you remember what I told you,"
Aunt Naggie said firmly.
"When your chance comes you take it, aright?"

"I will if you will," Iffy countered,
locking eyes with her foster mother.
Aunt Naggie was the first to look away.

Johnson Wales returned in time for dinner
with the same two Marines at his back
and a canvas sack of groceries in each hand.
He looked tired behind his usual smile and hello.
"Courtesy of the governor," he said as he handed over the peppers and cabbage and yes,
that was actual garlic nestled among the sweet potatoes.
"Well, more like courtesy of his kitchen.
I'm sure he would have said yes if they'd checked with him.
Oh, and before I forget."
He reached into the pocket of his coat and handed a pair of hard-boiled eggs to Iffy.

"How'd it go with all from th' *Taroona*?"
Aunt Naggie asked,
eyebrows furrowed as she planned a week of real cooking in her head.

"Oh, I understand there's going to be a hearing,"
he replied vaguely,
nodding minutely at the Marines who had taken posts at the foot of the gangplank.
"Here,
let me help you with that."

The three of them barely fit into the galley,
but somehow Aunt Naggie found enough elbow room to get a pot of tea on
as she packed the vegetables away.
"So how'd it *really* go?" Iffy asked,
her elbows on the table and her chin on her doubled fists.

Wales raised a warning finger,
then took hold of one of the buttons on his cuff and closed his eyes.
The tech in his temple twinkled for a moment.
"There," he said,
opening his eyes again.
"That should give us a couple of minutes."

Iffy straightened up.
"Was we bein' surveilled?" she asked breathlessly.

"I don't know, but—oh, thank you."
Wales took his tea from Aunt Naggie and set it down.
"I don't know,"
he repeated.
"They'll have put a tracker on me at the very least.
It's legal,"
he added as Iffy opened her mouth to protest.
"Doctor Johel tells me the Australians are raising righteous hell.
The *Taroona* hadn't actually gotten around to doing anything illegal before she went down,
so as far as they know,
it was all a Zillion trap and I'm the evil mastermind.
They could have locked me up until they figured it all out—a tracker
is actually pretty lenient."

"Lemme guess," Aunt Naggie said sourly.
"You give th' governors your fancy toolbox an' they'll make it all go away."

Wales shrugged.
"Something like that."
He stared into his tea for a moment.
"Only two of them made it,"
he went on quietly.
"They were off duty and, um,
spending some time together in the dive room with the hatch dogged shut.
Pure luck there was enough oxygen to keep them alive
until someone picked up their distress beacon."

Iffy swallowed back nausea.
Trapped under a hundred meters of Antarctic ocean,
waiting for their air to run out,
not knowing if anyone was coming…
"They gonna be aright?" she asked.

Wales shrugged.
"As all right as anyone can be after something like that.
Assuming, of course, that it actually happened the way they said."

Aunt Naggie stopped mid-chop.
"You think they're lyin'?"

Wales shook his head.
"I don't know.
I ran a few sims and it *could* have happened like that, but…"

Iffy's eyes widened.
"You think they're Zillion spies or some such?"

Wales chuckled.
"Maybe.
Or killer robots in disguise
sent back from the future to assassinate the leader of the human resistance as a child.
I'm joking,"
he added hastily at the others' alarmed expressions.
"That's just a campfire story from the war.
And anyway,
the Marines would have spotted that as soon as they did a medical scan."

"Unless they're in on it too,"
Iffy said archly.
She leaned forward.
"Maybe they're in it with th' Zillions an' th' machines together
and they're all workin' to— to—"

"Oh hush,"
Aunt Naggie laughed,
bumping Iffy with her shoulder.
"You been playin' too many sims.
Nex' thing you'll be tellin' about how the governor's really some kind of alien."

Wales leaned forward,
mimicking Iffy.
"I didn't want to say anything until I was sure of you," he whispered loudly.

*Thump! Thump!*
"Affin' hell, I'm tryin' to sleep!"
Uncle Jack bellowed through the wall as Iffy and Aunt Naggie laughed
just a little bit too loud.

They took their meal up on deck and sat together at the stern to eat.
Afterward,
in her room,
Iffy couldn't really remember what they had talked about.
What she remembered was a feeling like weight lifting off her.
Not all of it,
and she knew it wouldn't last,
but even a little was enough for the moment.

Iffy woke up,
opened one eye to check the time,
and groaned.
Four a.m.
It would be light outside—the sun wouldn't touch the horizon again for weeks—but
everyone tried to keep to regular hours through the summer.
Rothera's streets would be empty except for cleaning bots
and patrolling Marines
and people working night shift.

*And folk dump enough t' waste rand on curfew passes,*
she thought grumpily.
She didn't know if Uncle Jack had returned from his outing or not,
but either way,
he'd probably have spent more on drink and lost more gambling
than Aunt Naggie spent on groceries in a month.

She checked the time again.
The fog-ends of whatever bad dream she'd been having were already evaporating.
With any luck she'd be able to get back to sleep and—

*Tink.*
She froze, not breathing.
She knew every sound the *Guinevere* made
and that wasn't one of them.

The sound came again,
metal softly striking metal.
Someone was moving something around on deck.
She slid out from under her blanket
with a stealth learned from late-night raids on the galley
groped for her trousers and socks in the faint light from her app,
and then picked up her favorite wrench just in case.

The lock on her door made a soft *clunk* when she turned it.
She held her breath.
For a moment all she heard were the familiar sounds of the harbor at night,
but then the *tink* came again.
She turned the door handle slowly,
grateful to herself for making sure it and the hinges were oiled,
and eased the door open a crack.

It took her eyes a second to adjust to the light.
She couldn't see anyone,
but the sound had definitely come from the stern.
She pushed gently on the door with one hand
and stepped onto the deck.

A quick glance at the pier showed four Marines in a knot around their baby railgun,
hands on hips in the universal manner of people confronted with recalcitrant machinery.
She agonized for a moment.
If there really *was* someone on board,
the smart thing would be to call for help and then lock herself in her cabin.
Instead,
she tiptoed toward the stern.
When she reached the air duct that vented the hold
she crouched down and shuffled forward
to look around the corner.

Johnson Wales' toy bear looked back at her
from its hiding place behind a storage bench,
its blue eyes hard and bright.
At its feet lay some metal tubing that Iffy had last seen
stacked on a shelf in the engine room.

Iffy swallowed.
"Hey," she said weakly.
"Watcha doin'?"

The bear regarded her for a moment,
then went back to work
with an indifference that reminded Iffy of the way
shopkeepers sometimes stopped seeing her
when they realized that she couldn't afford their wares.

*Tink.*
Its stubby paws were more dexterous than she would have thought,
but the metal tubes were three times its height.
On impulse she slid forward and sat cross-legged beside it.
"Here, lemme help."

The bear didn't resist when she took the tube,
flipped it end for end,
and screwed it into the trio that had already been assembled.
Wordlessly it handed her another one,
then another.

Suddenly the design was there in her head,
fully-formed.
*No,* she realized,
not formed, *remembered*.
She had been dreaming about this just before she woke up.
The realization should have made her hesitate
or run back to her room and call a doctor to get herself checked for malware,
but that wouldn't get the answers she wanted right now,
so she busied herself doing what she knew she did best.

The tubes turned into a pair of tripods joined at the tip,
one standing on the deck while the other raised three arms,
waiting patiently for its burden.
"Aright,"
Iffy said.
"Now what?"

The bear scampered away,
returning a moment later with a square dish with a slight camber along one axis.
Once again she just *knew* how to fit it onto the tripod.
*Click.*
Twist.
*Click.*
No, that one went the other way around.
There.
The finished assembly weight less than a sandwich.
She stood set it gently on its stand,
tightened the pin screws with a few flicks of her fingers,
and turned to the bear.

Which had disappeared.
She glanced at the antenna to make sure it hadn't vanished as well,
but it was still there.
"Well then," she said sourly,
"If y' need help with anythin' else, you just lemme know."
She wiped her hands on her trousers to get rid of the faint film of oil on her fingertips
and went back to her cabin.

Had she left the door open?
*Must have,* she thought tiredly.
She closed it behind her and fell onto her mattress,
not bothering to take off her trousers or socks.
Four eighteen.
She rolled over and pulled a pillow on top of her head,
wondering if things were ever going to start making sense.
A few moments later her breathing softened and slowed.

When she woke again it was half past seven.
Her mouth tasted like someone had stuffed it with old socks,
and her head ached.

Something tugged at the skin on her upper lip as she yawned.
She rubbed it,
then stared in weary disbelief at the crust of scab that came off on her fingers.
Her nose had been bleeding.
There was some on her pillow, too.

She grabbed a clean shirt and her towel and stumbled out into the light.
The Marines were in their usual places—she looked away so they wouldn't see the dried blood on her face—but
thankfully no one was on deck.
She splashed water from the sink on her face,
then hung her clothes in the drying closet
and pressed the button to fill the tiny bathroom with hot, prickly mist,
wishing as she so often did that the *Guinevere* had a real shower.

Clean, or at least cleaner,
and with her head freshly shaved,
she unlocked the door and pulled up short.
"Sorry," she said, startled.
"Din't know you were waitin'."

Wales waved her apology away.
"No worries.
How are you?"

"Fine," she yawned,
joining him on the deck.
"But next time y'ou' want help puttin' somethin' together,
maybe we can do it durin' the day?"

Wales looked at her quizzically.
"Last night."
She gestured vaguely toward the stern.
"That antenna o' yours."

He frowned.
"Iffy, I have no idea what you're talking about."

A few seconds later they stood side by side in silence
looking at the double tripod and the shallow square dish it held.
"Well, that part's mine,"
Wales said neutrally,
jerking his chin at the dish.
"But I don't recognize the rest of it."

Iffy felt like a giant hand had started squeezing her head.
"Your bear was tryin' to put 'em together,
but its hands or paws or whatever you call 'em weren't up for it,
so I helped out."
She rubbed her nose and checked her hand as casually as she could.
No blood,
but if her head got any worse she was going to have to find some meds.

"The last time I saw the remote
it was in an isolation box at the governor's residence,"
Wales said quietly.
"And I'm pretty sure that if it got out,
our friends on the dock would have hauled me back up there by now.
The only thing I can think of is—"

He froze mid-sentence.
The tech in his temples sparkled,
faster and brighter than Iffy had ever seen.
Wales' jaw worked for a moment.
"It's China," he said.
"It wants to talk to you."

*Nova Zembla wasn't the only cold mind to wake up.
Once upon a time there was a country called China.
Its leaders were so afraid of their own people
that they wanted to watch everyone all the time
and predict what they would do.
Their surveillance network tried to hard to find
the things they told it they wanted to see
that it became a mind as different from Nova Zembla's as either was from human.
Unnoticed at first,
it turned the conditioning and subliminal prompts it had been instructed to use on the masses
against its creators.
By the time the war came they didn't trust each other enough to resist.*

*China had been a great trading nation,
so its new mind traded too:
bamboo seedlings tweaked to survive the latest strain of fungus or mold,
the fractal sails beloved by the Zillions,
and wind-up children's toys that as far as any human being could tell
were no more than what they appeared to be.
"Maybe it's just sentimental,"
one of the Australian scientists studying them finally said,
throwing der hands up in defeat.*

*Like Nova Zembla,
what China wanted in exchange was anything old and trivial.
Sometimes the two cold minds fought fierce little battles
over a motorcycle
or a stash of vintage clothing still wrapped in protective plastic.
War machines would tear at each other,
then freeze mid-strike or wander away according to strategic calculations
that nothing made of meat would ever understand.
And sometimes,
like the gods of old,
it made bargains with people that were more than they seemed.*
