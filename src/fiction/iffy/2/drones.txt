Something snapped inside Iffy.
She couldn't stand one more second of just waiting for *someone* to do *something*.
She ran back to her storage locker,
slammed the door closed behind her,
and took the box of dronelets out from under her mattress.

It only took a few moments to measure the capacity of their batteries and do a few calculations.
Fully charged,
they'd be able to stay in the air for twenty minutes,
less if there was a wind,
so call it fifteen.
Take a guess at their top speed...
No, she didn't have to guess,
that was right there in their firmware,
but going that fast would drain the battery a lot faster.
Time and distance shaped a curve behind her eyes.
Two kilometers---that was all she could count on.

Her shoulders slumped.
The canal where Honesty lived with their olders was almost that far on foot.
Even going straight across the harbor,
there was no way one of the dronelets could get there and back on a single charge.

She straightened up.
*One* of the dronelets couldn't,
but she had a set of four.
She leaped to her feet and ran to Aunt Naggie's cabin,
her boots clanging on the deck.

"Just a coupla meters," she said breathlessly,
spreading her arms to show the length she needed.

Her foster mother unspooled that much yarn,
then the same length again,
and snipped it off.
"Thank you!"
Iffy raced backed to her room and set to work.

It took half a dozen tries and a lot of swearing to get the balance right,
and she suspected that whoever had made the dronelets
would have been appalled at her clumsy invention,
but it worked.
At least,
she thought it would.
She *hoped* it would,
because she was only going to get one chance.
After that,
a couple of minutes with some markers and maybe,
just maybe,
her work would go unnoticed.

She stuffed the dronelets under her coat and went back on deck.
The sky had clouded over---she didn't know if that would help or not.
Uncle Jack was nowhere to be seen,
and (she glanced over the taffrail) the Marines were doing something with the railgun.
She wandered to harbor side of the *Guinevere* and took a deep breath,
willing her heart to slow.
When that didn't work she unzipped her coat and knelt on the deck.

One, two, three---she laid the dronelets out in a triangle.
And four---she set the remaining one on the knotted spiderweb of yarn she had made.
*Camouflage*, she ordered.
The dronelets changed color to match the deck.
*Airborne. No, not you.*
The fourth dronelet's tiny motors stilled.
It settled back onto the yarn strung between its three siblings.

*Launch.*
Flying in formation,
the three dronelets slid off the deck.
Iffy stood,
zipped her coat closed,
and rested her elbows on the taffrail to watch them fly away
just a few centimeters above the sluggish gray waves in the harbor.
Their camouflage ought to hide them from the spotter drones circling endlessly overhead.
She couldn't do anything about the yarn,
but she hoped the thin strands would go unnoticed or be classified as floating garbage.

Thirty seconds... sixty...
Each of the dronelets had cameras the size of sand grains woven into it.
She could look through them if she wanted,
but would the signal give them away?
Ninety seconds...
A hundred.
A hundred and ten.
She started a countdown in her head.
At one hundred and twenty seconds she let out the breath she hadn't realized she was holding.
If everything had worked,
the three dronelets should be on their way back
while the fourth's motors carried it onward to Honesty's home.

Another countdown.
Her heart nearly stopped when a seagull swooped down mid-harbor,
but then it squawked and flew away empty-beaked.
There---no,
that really was just a scrap of dredging net floating by.

She finally spotted the dronelets just a few meters away,
the yarn web empty between them.
She grinned.
She'd done it!

A heartbeat later the dronelets splashed into the harbor.
She goggled in wide-eyed disbelief.
Their batteries must have run out.
She looked around in a panic.
The gaff hook!
Iffy pulled it off the wall behind her,
dropped it to the deck with a clatter she was sure the governor himself could hear,
picked it up by the wrong end,
reversed it,
slung herself half over the taffrail,
and tried to hook the drones.
The hook was heavy---for a moment she was afraid she'd lose it too---but
then she caught the yarn and pulled her creations over to the side of the ship.
Sliding her weight back onto the deck,
she grabbed the gaff hook with both hands
and gently lifted the dripping dronelets out of the sea.

"What th' hell d'you think you're doin'?"
Uncle Jack demanded roughly behind her.

"Dropped somethin',"
Iffy said without looking at him.

"Affin' trash."
She didn't know if he meant her or the sodden tangle at her feet.
"You make sure that hook's secure, you mind me?"

"I will."
She set it back in its rack as he stomped back to the pilot house,
then picked up the dronelets and hurried back to her storage locker.

And waited.

And waited.

And checked the time on her app *again*
even though she knew it had only been a minute since she last checked.
"Yer bein' stupid," she muttered angrily,
tossing the app back onto the mattress.
She looked around her locker and set her jaw.

"What's got into you?"
Aunt Naggie asked a few minutes later,
bemused.

"Spring cleanin'," Iffy grunted as she mopped.
She had dragged her mattress out onto the deck
and piled her few belongings on top of it.
The bucket of soapy water beside them had gone brown.

"Well, if you're in th' mood,
you could have a go at th' galley."

"Sure."
Iffy straightened up,
breathing a little hard from exertion.
"Soon as I'm done here."

She calmed down enough by the time her room was clean
to regret saying she would do the galley as well,
but with Aunt Naggie there to lend a hand it was done in no time.
It helped that she kept the stove and the little square sink spotless,
and that they'd never been able to afford enough
to have boxes or jars of anything that wasn't in regular use.

Iffy managed not to check the time until she was sitting down
waiting for her tea.
Fifty-one minutes had passed.
Nine more and---

Iffy's storage locker still smelled like vinegar,
but she closed the door anyway and snibbed the lock.
There was no need to rig an antenna---like most ships her age,
the *Guinevere* had microfine wires woven into her hull for all-around radar,
and Iffy had long since figured out how to plug into them.
The only question was,
had the fourth dronelet made it all the way to Honesty's unobserved,
and did it have enough battery left to transmit?

The clock on her app counted down.
"C'mon c'mon," she whispered.
Five seconds... three...

*Packet received.*

"Woo hoo!"
She clapped her hands over her mouth and snorted a laugh through them.
A few keystrokes and the grainy images began their slideshow.

The canal where the Marine cutter lay at berth.
The barnacles were gone or nearly, she noticed.
The salvage booth with its heavy canvas curtain-door,
and beyond it,
the warehouse that Honesty's olders had turned into a home.
A faded ad for Volkov's hot sauce was still visible on its cinderblock wall.
She had drawn the same logo on the back of the dronelet.
With luck,
any cameras that picked up the dronelet's deliberately irregular motion
would think it was a scrap of paper being blown about by the wind.

The next image was from inside the salvage booth.
The timestamp in the corner showed that the dronelet had waited almost five minutes before taking it.
*Or before it was safe to sneak in,* she thought.
Her heart was pounding as if she was playing the most exciting sim ever.
She needed to pee,
but she couldn't stop watching now.

Honesty's Second was bent over their workbench in the next four images.
First joined them in the next one,
their arm around their younger sib's shoulder as if trying to lend them strength.

"---the gunk ounta sed affin' gears,"
Second said,
tinny and frustrated.

"Do as you can,"
First soothed them.
"They'll be back an' us t'morrow."

"That's as they said yesterday, but they ain't here,"
Second snapped.

Iffy's breath caught in her throat.
Had something happened to Honesty?
Had their induction gone wrong somehow?

The next image came up.
First's arm was still around Second's shoulders,
and the younger clone had leaned their head against the older.
Feeling a sudden pang of guilt,
Iffy swiped the images closed.
What she was doing was surveillance, pure and simple.
Worse than that,
she felt like she was betraying their trust.
They were just as worried about their youngest clone as Iffy was---more, even---and
intruding on them didn't feel right.

Still,
she didn't key in the commands to recall the dronelet
or untangle the others and send them to fetch it.
The dronelet's little core was smart enough to find a way to recharge.
With luck,
it would be able to show her what she wanted to see the next time it transmitted.
She could always apologize later.
