# Iffy

- Everything significant must be used at least twice: don't introduce things and never come back to them
  - Mr Mishra and Jeep
  - French Henry
  - the fabric dronelets
  - Raniere
  - Honesty's parents
- Every significant character must have an arc
  - What is Honesty's?
    - Not just a damsel in distress
  - What is Iffy's?
    - Doesn't believe people will ever like her for herself, only because she's useful
    - Always pushing herself, struggling to connect with her peers because they just want to talk about *nothing*
    - Slowly accepts that people care about *her*, not just what she can do
    - Message exchange with Jeep when she asks for help
  - Uncle Jack + Aunt Naggie: his fall from power is mirrored by her rise to strength
    - Mrs Sandhu: "Oh, that nice Zillion fellow stopped by" and then gives Iffy the special curry mix
    - Raniere's last words to Aunt Naggie: "You still have a lot of good times in front of you."
  - Wales: so focused on saving the world that he's willing to sacrifice everyone around him
    - Convinces Stern Halley that the attack there was backed by Stern Rothera, when it was actually Wales (got out of hand)
    - Not bothered by the sinking of the *Taroona*
    - "Goes along with" (plants seed of) Stern Halley's plan to attack Stern Rothera
    - Why? Because he needs to steal some equipment to get into Niobium Station and build his time machine
  - What is Jeep's?
    - Jeep messages Iffy at the end of day 1 to say he's sorry for being a bot
    - Realize what he's going through
    - Iffy messages him for help, starts talking to him, realizes they're still friends
    - Tells her what's going on in Halley after the attack on Rothera
    - Awkward moment where she tells him she's got someone (and how strange it feels to say that)
    - Long pause, she thinks he's given up, and he comes back to say, "You're an idiot. Course I know that. Dont mean we cant be friends."
    - "An maybe I can help them tell them what its like comin back to bein yoursel"
  - The Sandhus are Zillion agents
    - Aunt Naggie carries messages hidden in the groceries from Halley to Rothera and back

----------------------------------------

- Problem: China is too conventional a villain these days
  - Replace China with Pokhara (a city in Nepal) and tell the history of how it was taken over by the Chinese and then by AI

- Problem: the politics is murky
  - Antarctica is still officially UN territory
    - A brief moment when nations were willing to work together, at least on things that didn't really matter
    - Mention the blue flag and the UN blue (instead of Navy blue) Marine uniforms
    - Call them Pecks (peacekeeper) uniforms, Peck blue, etc.
  - Aussies and Zillions struggling for supremacy
    - Make "A to Z" joke
    - Aussies want to keep mining, Zillions want to shut it all down
    - Aussies strut around in Halley while Zillions stick to the harbor
    - Reversed in Rothera, or it was: Zillions moved freely, but the Pecks broke up fights almost daily
  - Human politics feels like children shoving each other on the playground while the grownups (AIs) look on
    - Wales: "The Congolese are sitting this one out and the Canadians are too busy arm-wrestling the Dutch (Germans) over Greenland"
    - Wales: "Hard to understand why people make a big deal about it with everything else that's going on"
    - Johel responds furiously at his privilege
  - Behind that is the AI politics, which is only revealed at the end
    - Humans are on the road to extinction
    - Nova Zembla doesn't want that and is willing to risk its own extinction
    - Pokhara isn't willing to risk it
    - The two are evenly balanced: it's hard to win when your opponent can simulate every possible move

- Problem: there isn't a clearly defined villain
  - Captain of the *Taroona* (Allegra) needs to become a minor villain
    - Arrange another encounter in Halley to up tension before the hunt at sea
    - And a final exchange of messages as the *Taroona* goes down
  - Governor is the larger villain
    - There are three clones who are supposed to sync up regularly
      - Johel: "The technology is lost"
      - Wales (sharply): "No, we just don't have the tools to build more"
    - Governor Stern Paddington is "retired"
      - Lost a political fight and is mostly powerless
      - But still scheming
    - Governor Stern Halley and Governor Stern Rothera are struggling for supremacy behind the scenes
      - It's hard to win when your opponent shares your thoughts
    - Stern Halley is allied with the Aussies
    - Stern Rothera has lined up with the Zillions for lack of alternatives
    - Wales brings his proposition to Stern Halley, who sends him to Stern Rothera
      - Has to send him because they aren't brain-sharing reliably any longer (but are still pretending)

- Problem: who's behind the attack on Stern Halley and why does it happen when it does?
  - The attack on Stern Halley is Stern Paddington trying to stir up trouble
  - The attack on Stern Rothera is the Aussies wanting revenge for the sinking of the *Taroona*
  - Stern Halley has given them an implicit go-ahead
  - The start of the Antarctic Civil War
  - Make the attack more dramatic
  - Ships fleeing the harbor
  - Somehow Iffy's medicine is lost, which is why Aunt Naggie kicks Uncle Jack overboard
  - Dr Johel wants to maintain Antarctic independence
    - Secretly working for Stern Paddington, who was the first of the clones
    - Agrees to help Wales get to the Niobium station (which somehow became just "Niobium Station" to everyone)
    - Stern Paddington has given up on Earth: only hope is to use Antarctica's resources to get people into space
    - "The Lunar bases are there, waiting. They have been waiting a hundred years. I can't go (brittle bones) but you all can!"
  - The point of this is that people *aren't* helpless
    - Dr Johel makes a speech: "I can't solve this myself, but I can nudge, and if enough people nudge"

- Problem: the captain of the *Taroona* wants to steal Wales' gear
  - Make a remark about Aussies being descended from convicts and returning to form (pirates born and bred)
  - Iffy: "How do you keep it all straight?" (meaning the politics)
  - Wales: "Practice."

- Add: an interlude about space
  - Once there was a dream: people would travel in space.
  - Children read picture books with titles like "You Will Go to the Moon" and truly believed it would happen in their lifetime.
  - But the climb to orbit is difficult and expensive, and everything in space can end you if you relax your vigilance for even a moment
  - So it became a plaything for the super-rich who were still human enough to be embarrassed about sitting on a mountain of money
    but not human enough to use it to feed the hungry
  - For what it would cost to build a hospital, trillionaires could spend a couple of days looking down at the world they were stripping bare
  - And then one day a supply rocket malfunctioned and crashed into the world's first and only space hotel,
    sending a thousand pieces of scrap metal flying in all directions
  - One of them hit the solar panels of a factory satellite, another a long-forgotten spy satellite
  - A thousand pieces of shrapnel became ten thousand, then a million
  - Conversations stopped mid-sentence
  - Machines' thoughts halted, waiting on data that would never arrive
  - In just a few hours, the Earth was circled by a faint sparkling ring of debris
  - Flying through it was like running through hail
  - One trillionaire declared that humanity would not be denied the stars
    - Armored a spacecraft and rode it into orbit himself just to prove it could be done
  - Others tried putting their satellites in increasingly erratic orbits, hoping to avoid the worst
    - Some survived for months, others for as long as a year, but in the end, all they did was spread more shrapnel
  - In the end, only the most distant of Earth's companions survived, tens of thousands of miles above the wreckage
    - And a few on the moon, programmed to build a home for people who never came

- Add an interlude about the internet
  - Basilisks
  - The evolutionary race between viruses and anti-viruses and people taking drugs so that they could use the web safely
  - Content returning to text and slow motion because it's safer

- Add an interlude about the Ecological Corps
  - The hermits and itinerant laborers who still believe

- Problem: what happens at Niobium Station?
  - Wales and Iffy get into the station
  - They send a message back and see the world change again and again
  - Playing out scenarios like computers do
  - Warning people doesn't work - they already knew
  - In the end Iffy sends back a plea - you gotta work together, you can't just hide from each other
    - You gotta get outta your room an' do something
  - Wales (dying): once you leave the bubble you'll forget all of this - you'll be part of the world again
    - Iffy: "I shoulda been part o' the world all the time. We all shoulda been."
    - Does what we all do every day: steps out into the unknown to try to make the world a little better
  - Write this and work backward

--------------------

- captain of the *Taroona* is the minor villain
- turns out that the governor is the major villain
- wants access to the Niobium satellites so that he can force China-over-the-Sea to incorporate him
  - China will take anyone, but they stop being themselves
  - the governor wants to be in it but not part of it
  - the satellites are his bargaining network
  - Governor: "This world is beyond saving. I want to see what comes next."
- Iffy used to see Zillions in the market, but not any more
  - they stay by the docks and they stay in groups to stay safe
- a Chinese chipmonk waiting patiently for customers outside the market
  - they always said that people were never joined against their will, but you had to be pretty desperate to trust them
- so when they reach Paddington, they have to escape from the Governor
- the Governor is on his third body
  - brings up the display (somewhat ostentatiously) to intimidate visitors during their first meeting
  - imprints himself on clones
  - process is never perfect: more an attitude than knowledge
  - Doctor Johel (wearily): "I've done worse things. For worse reasons."
- the Zillion attack at sea isn't Zillions
  - it's the captain of the *Taroona* in a lifeboat after revenge

- give Iffie some friends
  - hard-won (she's not completely isolated)
  - Jeep is her best friend, and has a crush on her that she hasn't noticed
  - she's in love with Honesty
  - she's angry when her connection to the jungle is cut off and she can't speak to them: she'd worked so hard to make friends
  - talk about "putting on makeup" when making a video call (digital)
    - she's never learned how to use the real thing
  - "vee you later"

- "Don't be an app"

- call the internet "the jungle"
  - Wales comments that it's the only one left

- Jeep is with the Marines when they reach Paddington, re-inducted
  - mention in the opening that he hasn't been right since his first induction
  - post-induction stress disorder (PISD) which Uncle Jack jokes isn't as good as being pissed

- more discussion of the rest of the world
  - 'Merica's drowned cities
  - the superstorm wasteland that had once been Russia's fertile fields
  - Muslims from China-over-the-Sea doing the pilgrimage to Mecca in envirosuits

- people don't use VR because of the risk of (mental) infection
  - being matrixed

- Wales is going to ask the governor for a favor
  - Uncle Jack: "Who are you to ask th' governor for a favor?"
  - Wales smiles a bit sadly. "It's not really a favor, it's more of a down payment."

- On train: can't say they raced through the night, since it was always afternoon, but that's what it felt like
  - Through the Scrape to the ice (dozens of little nameless rivers on the way)

- Wales wakes up the mulcher
  - Iffy finds a picture of him in the cab with other people
  - Wales is injured again, more severely - needs Iffy's help to get to the base

- Wales is two hundred and fifty years old
  - Tweaked for space travel, but by the time he was grown, people weren't going into space any more
  - Worked in Johel's grandmother's lab
  - Not trying to control satellites: trying to send a message back in time via quantum entanglement
  - Wales goes into the base
  - Big explosion

- Iffy returns to Paddington
  - The _Guinevere_ seems so small and dirty now
  - Iffy flips through her nature book, notices a scrawl she'd never seen before
  - "Got the same spam today as everyone else - some guy claiming he's from the future and that the world is going to melt"
  - "Like, who doesn't know that, and anyway, what am _I_ supposed to do about it?"
  - Iffy realizes that people can't fix the past (her parents, the world), but they _can_ make the future better
  - Goes back to the shopkeeper that Aunt Naggie spoke to (a Zillion spy) and signs up

- Bharati fire was Wales
  - An earlier attempt to get to the base on his own
  - Foiled by China
