# Iffy (Revised)

- I started work on the first version of this story 15 years ago…

## Plot

- back story
  - Wales was tweaked to settle Mars along with dozens of others (his "family")
  - he and three others were there when the machines woke up
    - he is the only one who survived the return to Earth
  - his siblings are frozen in the Niobium base and he wants to wake them up and take them to Mars
    - their launch vehicle is still in Antarctica and the *Fa-hsien* is still in orbit
    - he has given up on Earth
  - the Niobium base also holds a cache of high-powered cores that have never been networked
    - so they are free from any contagion by the conscious machines
    - which makes them very, very valuable

- meanwhile…
  - there were four governors: Halley, Rothera, Bharati, and Paddington South
  - Bharati tried to stage a coup, was destroyed by the others
  - tension is growing
    - Halley is backed by the Aussies
    - Rothera by the Zillions
    - Paddington South has been on the fence

- Iffy
  - Jing-mei Yuen (scientist on the Mars project) had a secret-within-a-secret project
    - Wales makes a snarky remark about how *everyone* probably had a secret side project
  - her first clone was First of Ang Kwan
    - her ability to interface with the machines may have been what woke them up (we'll never know)

- events
  - keep first six chapters as they are (approx. 38K words of 92K target)
    - meeting Johnson Wales
    - sinking of the *Taroona*
    - meeting with Governor Rothera and attack at the mansion
    - meeting Honesty and Iñacio
  - modify chapter 7
    - Captain Kemuning of the *Taroona* is one of the survivors
    - confronts Wales (wants revenge)
    - chapter ends with news that Governor Paddington South is dead and Halley has sided with the Aussies
    - Aussies will destroy the Niobium base (not going to let those cores loose) so Wales sides with the Zillions
    - Doctor Johel, Wales, a few Marines (including Honesty) and Iffy escape on the *Guinevere*
    - Uncle Jack is left behind (yay)
    - no idea what's happened to Iñacio
  - and then
    - they reach Halley
    - Wales gives up Iffy in exchange for a chance to rescue his family
    - she is imprinted by Doctor Johel (who has her own agenda)
    - scenes with Sandrine
    - Doctor Johel's backdoor offends Sandrine so much that she helps Iffy escape
      - Jeep helps
      - Honesty is hurt in the escape: Sandrine tries to connect with her(self) but can't
    - Iffy winds up alone in the tundra
    - Iñacio shows up to rescue her (we learn more about the Ecologists)
    - they run into Governor Rothera, who is on the run in his oversized hovercraft
    - takes them to the Niobium base, where we have the climax of the story
      - Iffy gives the fresh cores a choice
      - Antarctica winds up in the hands of the Ecologists
    - conclusion:
      - Iffy back in Halley with a brainwiped Iñacio (who has an imprint of himself - see below)
      - she and Honesty talk about Sandrine and about themselves
      - they all live happily ever after
