        The older brother (who would always think of himself that way)
        shouldered his pack.
        He looked up at the orange sun,
        dying but not yet dead,
        and set off to find out what would happen next.

        "I didn't fall," she whispered.
        The world was so quiet that everyone around could hear her clearly.
        "I didn't have an accident. I had <em>him</em>."

        There it is in your gut: that feeling again.
        Fear, revulsion–it doesn't matter what it is.
        For the first time, you feel something, and you want more.

        The young man shook his head.
        "No poison, no bombs, not for you," he told the great detective.
        "No, for <em>you</em>, I have a whole new type of crime."

      <p>
        Once upon a time a little girl was born.
        This is the story of the numbers that were born with her–where they came from,
        how they moved from place to place,
        who used them and fixed them and how they met other numbers
        until finally, one day, they were called home.

      <p>
        In the beginning there was a great Big Bang, so powerful that
        the whole universe is still expanding.  This is the story of
        what happened afterward, of the Earth and life and civilization
        and maybe, just maybe, of what comes next.
