# The Prince and the Cloudherd

-   Noxy's problem is that she pretends to know things that she doesn't.

-   What are my favorite scenes?
    -   Rescuing the soldiers from the forest.
    -   Playing snakes and whistles ("It depends what game you're playing.")
    -   Flying a kite (wraps up the ending nicely).
    -   Aft and Gas arguing in Indy's kitchen.
    -   Picking spiderwebs (Sensy and Noxy talking, establishing Noxy's character).
    -   Noxy accidentally dunking Thokmay.
    -   The dinner where Noxy's father embarrasses himself and kindles Indy's interest in Dorbu (probably doesn't fit any longer).
    -   Stuck underground.
    -   Noxy offering herself to the lightnings and Thokmay taking her place.
    -   Can I reverse that and have Thokmay offer himself and Noxy gives up the chance of being the voice of the forest?
        -   No: she doesn't really want it, so giving it up doesn't have power.
    -   Need to make the point that the world is ruled by kings instead of magicians because kings don't have to pay for their power.
        -   Shudarga's Rebellion would put magicians in power despite the age-old proscription dating from Pilot times.
    -   If the sacrifice to the lightnings is going to make any sense, they have to be introduced early.
        -   Lightnings are gathering as they rescue the soldiers (there'd be nothing they could do if the lightnings attacked).
        -   "The Ruudians call them 'sky wolves', but they're more frightening than any wolf could have been."
        -   The lightning strike that destroys the drying shed (Noxy feels them passing overhead).

-   The *tralpa* changes sides
    -   Royalist
    -   The Captain plays on his resentment of his minor position
    -   He betrays Thokmay's identity (which Kulbinder has shared with him)
    -   Noxy sees the way in which manipulation and pressure harm people
-   Rind's baby is due
    -   The Captain works a spell to stop the birth until Thokmay is brought back
    -   Aft doesn't want to track them down but has no choice

## Act 1

-   Opening Image: A before snapshot of your main character/hero and their world
    -   Rescue scene
    -   Make it more dramatic:
        camp has been overrun,
        soldiers are running to a peak carrying two packages on their shoulders
        (their dead)
        as well as a wounded soldier (the Captain)
    -   Kulbinder is almost frantic to save his boy rather than the Captain
    -   Noxy does something to control the cloud or make it do something unusual
        -   First suggestion of her conflict with her powers
        -   She "hears" the forest and calms it
    -   Captain will mistakenly believe it's a secret cloudherd power
    -   Villagers will deny any knowledge, Noxy will clumsily try to mislead
    -   Truth will come out: Noxy is the Voice of the Forest (maybe)
    -   Outer conflict: does Noxy save the village by serving the rebel cause?
        -   Inner conflict for Sergeant Dorbu: "Nobody should *have* to, honored."

-   Theme Stated: A statement made by a character (normally not the hero) that
    hints at what the hero's arc will be (i.e., what the hero must
    learn/discover before the end of the book).
    -   Noxy and Sensy are picking spiderwebs while Rash looks after the littles
        -   Reveals that the adults are away
        -   It was Noxy's decision to gather spiderwebs, and then again for
            Rash to look after the littles: she's used to being in control
        -   Thinks this is what her mother and grandmother do (will learn that it's not)
    -   Inner conflict: does Noxy accept that people have their own lives and
        aren't just pieces to be moved around?
    -   Trolls show up
        -   First of Noxy's strange twinges
        -   For a moment she thinks the strange face she sees is---but no, it's a troll
            (foreshadowing her father)
        -   Make the encounter longer and more frightening
        -   Later have the Old Troll apologize: the youngsters get excited sometimes
    -   Kulbinder shows up and scares the trolls away (apparently)
    -   Introduces the trouble of the opening: soldiers need help

-   Set-up: An exploration of the hero's status quo life and all its flaws. This
    is where we learn what the hero's life and world look like before its epic
    transformation.
    -   External conflict: does the village help the rebel soldiers?
        -   Generational conflict between Grappa Gas and Aft mirrors
            the quieter struggle between Indy and Noxy
            (and in glimpses, between Indy and Granna Fee)
        -   Aft (with a pregnant wife Rind) is opposed to helping ("send them on their way")
        -   So Grappa Gas is in favor
        -   He has always been full of tall tales, and now one's landed on his doorstep
    -   See Indy manipulating people: "Will you have it said that we abandoned travellers?"
        -   "Travellers get three nights" (sets a clock for the story)
    -   Riding clouds
    -   Get to the camp to find it overrun and abandoned
    -   Noxy's twinge tells her which way to go
    -   Rescue the soldiers: Noxy somehow holds off the animals
    -   Granna Fee notices and is afraid: this is what broke Noxy's father (who turned troll)
    -   Back to the village, first confrontation with the *tralpa*
        -   Make Nangyal more competent as a magician, but greedier
        -   An example of what the rebellion is fighting *against*
        -   Indy tells them both to behave
        -   Repeats: "two nights and three days"
    -   Argument with Grappa Gas and Aft: get to see Indy in action
        -   Noxy watches quietly, admiring how her mother gets people to see things her way
        -   Mention the funeral service: Granna Fee will say the words
        -   They're worried about the *tralpa*
        -   "There's nothing we can do" (Indy)
    -   Noxy with Rash and Sensy
        -   First hints that Rash and Sensy might have something going on
        -   Discuss the spring fancy:
            Noxy briefly thinks that she should make sure Aft is going with her,
            but it can wait
    -   Funeral scene (solemn)
        -   Mention that they never had a scene for Noxy's dad
        -   Noxy (fiercely) "That's because he's not dead." (foreshadow that he's turned troll)
        -   Another foreshadowing as Granna Fee hugs her
    -   Confrontation with the *tralpa* on the way back
        -   See how protective Sergeant Dorbu of his men
        -   And how much he believes

-   Catalyst: An inciting incident that happens to the hero which will catapult
    them into a new world or new way of thinking.
    -   Showing Thokmay around the village
        -   Mention the tunnels, and the cloudherds' claustrophobia
    -   Sensy and Rash react to him warmly, making Noxy feel jealous
        -   Playing snakes and whistles, realize that Thokmay is very agile
        -   He surrenders at the end making it a tie
        -   Noxy: "That's not how you win" Thokmay: "It depends what game you're playing"
    -   Sensy and Rash suggest taking him to see the clouds
        -   Noxy hijacks their idea: "*amma* told *me* to show him around" (she snaps because of losing the game)
    -   She can hear Old Blue without touching him
        -   Has gotten onto the cloud with Thokmay when her mother shows up
        -   Noxy feels humiliated
        -   Given chores
    -   Noxy discovers that Rash and Sensy are going to the fancy together
    -   On the rooftops that night, she discovers that Rash and Sensy have been spending time together
    -   Overhears Kulbinder talking to the *tralpa*, realizes that the tiger is a royalist spy
        -   Misunderstands: thinks Kulbinder wants to get *himself* back to the capital
        -   Thinks "Great, now I can't even go with him"
    -   Sneaks back into the house, falls asleep, dreams
    -   Wakes up outside the village with no idea how she got there (sleepwalking)

-   Debate: A reaction sequence in which the hero debates what they will do next,
    usually presented in the form of a question.
    -   ???

## Act 2

-   Break into 2: The moment the hero decides to accept the call to action, leave
    their comfort zone, try something new, venture into a new world or new way
    of thinking.
    -   Captain wakes up
    -   He's a magician (just like Noxy's father was)
    -   He believes the rebellion is doomed unless something drastic is done
    -   He plans to force the cloudherds to drown the capital
    -   Sergeant Dorbu is opposed (big argument with Indy), but will do what needs to be done

-   B Story: The introduction of a new character or characters who will ultimately
    serve to help the hero learn the theme.
    -   Reveal that Thokmay is a prince

-   Fun and Games: This is where we see the hero in their new world. Also called
    "the Promise of the Premise", this section represents the hook of the
    story. Why the reader picked up the novel in the first place.
    -   Escape from the village
    -   Steal a cloud
    -   Go to find the adults who have gathered at Moose Barf

-   Midpoint: Literally the middle of the novel, where the Fun and Games
    culminates in either a false victory or a false defeat. Something should
    happen here to raise the stakes and push the hero toward real change.
    -   Noxy, Thokmay, and Kulbinder reach Moose Barf
    -   The adults have already left

-   Bad Guys Close In: If the midpoint was a false victory, this section will be a
    downward trajectory where things get consistently worse for the hero. If the
    midpoint was a false defeat, this section will be an upward trajectory where
    things get seemingly better. Regardless of trajectory, the hero's inner
    demons or internal bad guys are also closing in.

-   All is Lost: The lowest point of the novel. This is an action beat where
    something happens to the hero that, combined with those internal bad guys,
    pushes them to rock bottom.
    -   Noxy finds her father in the forest
    -   The forest won't help

-   Dark Night of the Soul: Another reaction beat (similar to the Debate) where
    the hero takes a moment to react to everything that's happened leading up to
    this moment. The darkest night before the dawn, this is the moment right
    before the hero figures out the solution to their big problem and learns the
    theme.

## Act 3

-   Break into 3: The aha moment! The hero realizes what they must to do to not
    only fix all of the problems created in act 2, but more importantly, fix
    themselves.

-   Finale: The hero proves they have truly learned the theme and enacts the plan
    they came up with in the Break into 3. Bad guys are destroyed, inner demons
    are conquered, lovers are reunited. The hero's world is not only
    saved...it's a better place than it was before.

-   Final Image: A mirror to the Opening Image, this is the closing snapshot of
    who the hero is now that he's gone through this epic and satisfying
    transformation.
    -   Surviving rebels are leaving for Chaghan with Sergeant Dorbu
    -   Prince Thokmay is returning to the capital
    -   But he would be honored to dance with Noxy at the fancy

----

-   What purpose does the *tralpa* serve?
    -   The other bad guy: village is caught between two stones (the *tralpa* and the Captain)
    -   A bit of comic relief: he's so pompous that he's icky
-   Noxy's father was the *tralpa*
    -   Over-spent himself to save the village from the scribbles

----

## History

- The plague (scribbles) killed a few people in the village but many more in the lowlands
- In its wake, labor was scarce and people became restive about ancient laws being used to constrain them
- Shudarga organized, was persecuted and imprisoned, smuggled letters out, escaped and led rebellion
- Succeeded at first because the royals hadn't prepared
  - "People are already calling it the Summer of Justice, but I prefer the Summer of Hope"
- Then other kingdoms joined the fight, afraid that rebellion would spread

That brought grumbles instead of murmurs.
As a brilliant young scholar, Shudarga had written pamphlet after pamphlet arguing that Gandan's laws should be free for all to use.  The kingdom's merchant-nobles had ignored her at first, then mocked her, but when she started organizing peasants and tradesmen to pool their money so that they could rent laws together, their laughter turned to anger. Arrested, she had escaped the previous summer and raised her flag in rebellion, attracting thousands to her cause.  Then winter had come and news from the lowlands had slowed to a trickle, leaving the cloudherds with nothing to chew on but rumors.
