Owing to some inexplicable wounds found on the bodies of seals, it has been suggested that a land mammal might exist in these regions, though hitherto unseen by man. Most of us were incredulous of this theory, but on that night we suddenly came on a floe covered with soft snow which bore the impress of footprints wide apart and bearing every appearance of having been made by a large land animal. The excitement was great and observers with cameras were soon over the side and breathlessly examining this strange spoor; but alas! it was soon detected that the impress was that of a webbed foot, and gradually we can to the conclusion that the footprints were those of a large giant petrel, and that their distance apart was due to the fact that they had been made when the bird, half-flying and half-walking, and been lazily rising on the wing. - diary of Captain Robert Falcon Scott, January 21, 1902.

March 11, 1902: Seaman George T. Vince was taken by the ice while sledging back to camp in a storm.

Jan 5, 1902: *Discovery* is joined by *Morning* and *Terra Nova*; Scott's orders are to abandon *Discovery* if it can't break free of ice within six weeks. Jan 28: ice creaking and breaking up. Feb 5 and 6: men set charges in the ice (ostensibly to help it break up, but what if?) Feb 14: wind comes up and starts to break up ice. More charges set (to encourage Those Beneath?) Feb 17: free of the ice.

1910: Only Bowers kept going in all weathers on the sail back to Antarctica. "Bowers would cast a bucket over astern, and hauling it aboard full of icy water and slush, would upset it...over his nude anatomy... After these acts of self-affliction, Bowers---who normally differed from the rest of his shipmates by the remarkable pinkness of his skin---would exhibit a fiery glow from head to foot."

Jan 1911: Scott noticed, "...six or seven killer whales... They seemed excited and dived rapidly, almost touching the floe... As we watched they suddenly appeared astern, raising their snouts out of the water. I had heard weird stories of these beasts, but had never associated serious danger with them. The photographer seized his camera and ran towards the floe to get a close picture... The next moment the whole floe under him heaved and split into fragments. One could hear the booming noise as the whales rose beneath the ice and struck it... Whale after whale rose under the ice, setting it rocking fiercely."

"Night shadows of cruel dark purple add to the natural gloom... How sinister and relentless the western mountains look, how cold and unforgiving the foothills, how ashy gray the sullen icefoots that gird this sad, frozen land..." - diary of Seaman Edgar Evans, March 1911.

Young Russian dog driver Dimitri.

Oates was from an old aristocratic family, spent his teenage years at Gestingthorpe Hall.

June 27, 1911 (at the base of the Barrier): "Down came a steady stream of very cold air which we noticed only a few yards from the bottom." The temperature dropped from -26F to -47F in just a few miles.

Dec 7-8, 1911: Amundsen's team made steady progress while Scott's was pinned down by a heavy storm, losing precious days.

December: Scott orders Cherry-Garrard, Keohane, Atkinson, and Wright to return. Wright in particular is bitterly disappointed. Despite his considerable skills in navigation, he led the team in a semi-circle on the glacier (because Scott wasn't with them?). Dec 20 was the last day all 12 men marched together. They spotted sandstone and red granite on the rocks around them, as well as stratification that may have been coal.

Scott's route in 1912 took him from Ross Island, across the Great Ice Barrier, up the Beardmore Glacier. Amundsen went from the Bay of Whales up the Axel Heiberg Glacier.

sastrugi: little ridges of wind-blown snow, running parallel with the direction of the air currents.

Jan 2, 1912: Scott's team is visited by a skua [sic] in a latitude beyond 87S and an elevation near ten thousand feet.

Scott never explained why he changed plans and took five men to the pole instead of four.

Jan 16, 1912: they reach the pole and find Amundsen's cairn and black flag, and the clear traces of dogs' paws---many dogs.

A note in the Polheim tent: "Dear Captain Scott---As you probably are the first to reach this area after us, I will ask you to kindly forward this letter to King Haakon VII. If you can use any of the articles left in the tent please do not hesitate to do so. The sledge left outside may be of use to you. With kind regards I wish you a safe return. Yours truly, Roald Amundsen." But there was no sledge.

Jan 24-29, 1912: "the sledge with our good wind behind runs splendidly" (Scott). But the men are miserable: pus-filled frostbite sores, Wilson suffering tortures in his eyes. Bowers stopped recording times of meteorological observations---his watch had gone awry.

Jan 30, 1912: "Evans dislodged two fingernails tonight: his hands are really bad."

Jan 31, 1912: picked up food at Three-Degree Depot. Oates' toes are blackening.

Feb 6, 1912: "a beasty position amidst crevasses and huge open chasms".

Feb 16, 1912: "Evans has nearly broken down in brain." (Scott)

Feb 17, 1912: "We stopped, and seeing Evans a long way astern, I camped for lunch. There was no alarm after first, [but] after lunch, and Evans still not appearing, we looked out to see him still afar off. By this time we were alarmed, and all four started back on ski. I was the first to reach the poor man and shocked at his appearance; he was on his knees with clothing disarranged, hands uncovered and frostbitten, and a wild look in his eyes. Asked what was the matter, he replied with a slow speech that he didn't know, but thought he must have fainted... He died quietly at 12:30 am." (Scott)

Mar 14, 1912: -43F "No idea there could be temperatures like this at this time of year with such winds." (Scott)

undated: "Oates slet through the night...hoping not to wake, but he woke in the morning. It was blowing a blizzard. He said, 'I am just going outside and may be some time.' He went out into the blizzard and we have not seen him since..." When they reached their next camp without finding their missing comrade, they decided that his heavy sleeping bag could be left behind to lighten their load, even though they kept the thirty-five pounds of geologic specimens they had collected.

The bodies of Scott and his companions were discovered by a search party on 12 November 1912 and their records retrieved. Tryggve Gran, who was part of the search party, described the scene as, "snowcovered til up above the door, with Scott in the middle, half out of his bagg [sic]... the frost had made the skin yellow & transparent & I've never seen anything worse in my life." Their final camp became their tomb; the tent roof was lowered over the bodies and a high cairn of snow was erected over it, topped by a roughly fashioned cross, erected using Gran's skis. Next to their bodies lay 35 pounds (16 kg) of *Glossopteris* tree fossils which they had dragged on hand sledges. These were the first ever discovered Antarctic fossils and proved that Antarctica had once been warm and connected to other continents.

Difference between brash ice, cake ice, grease ice, and frazil ice
- Brash ice is an accumulation of floating ice made up of fragments not more than 2m across. It is the wreckage of other forms of ice.
- Frazil ice is a collection of loose, randomly oriented, plate or discoid ice crystals formed in supercooled turbulent water.
- Grease ice is a very thin, soupy layer of frazil crystals clumped together, which makes the ocean surface resemble an oil slick.
