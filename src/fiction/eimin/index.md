## Chapter 1

People believe many different things about what happens when you die.
In the north, the Ruudians spent six hundred years fighting undead monsters who stripped the flesh from the bones of the living.
Sunshine and courage were often their only weapons,
so I suppose it is not surprising that they believe the souls of the righteous dead rise up to fuel the sun
so that it can shine down and keep us safe forever.

In the west,
on the other hand,
the farmers of the Regimental Kingdoms bury their dead to thank the earth for its bounty.
Just as flesh becomes soil, then barley, then flesh again,
so too,
they believe,
does the world fashion new spirits out of old.

The pirates of Ini Bantang and Barra Bantang believe in rebirth too,
except they believe we are reborn as ourselves to live our lives over again until we get them right.
This is why they say *im awa pha ta* whenever anything bad happens:
it means, "Oh no, not this again."
And I met a tiger once who told me that when we die we're dead,
and that all the rest is just monkey foolishness.
Later,
though,
he asked me to ring a bell in memory of a friend of his,
so perhaps tigers can be foolish too.

But in the Karaband,
where I was born,
people believe that when they die they get to tell the story of their life one last time.
It doesn't matter then if it's filled with great deeds and poetry or simple and quiet.
All that matters is whether the person telling the story enjoys hearing it again.

We Karabandi think it's important to know what our stories are going to be like while we are still living them,
so every once in a while we go to someone and say,
"This is the tale of me."
Sometimes it is best if the listener is a once-met stranger.
Other times the story will only make sense if the listener is someone in particular—a loved one who has been wronged
or someone who remembers the sour-sweet taste of a particular grandmother's date cookies.

And sometimes,
when the story that needs telling is particularly difficult,
people seek out someone who is so good at listening that they have become famous for it.
You can find such listeners in every town or caravan.
We all have some other profession—cobbler, bookster, even thief—but our real calling is to hear people out.
We try not to judge, and we never repeat any of what we're told.
We just help people find out what their lives mean while they are still living them.

The other thing we listeners do is teach people how to tell their stories.
It can be hard if you've never done it before—our lives teach us to hide our feelings,
even from ourselves,
and digging them up can be harder than mining glass.
I find the easiest way is to tell people my own story first,
so if there is any tea left in the pot…?
And perhaps a little more of the honey?
Thank you.

So: my name is Eimin, and this is the tale of me.
I was born in Medef, on the eastern shore of the Sea of Glass.
The people of Medef are not like people elsewhere.
They are Aphsi:
they can *drome* whether someone are happy or sad,
just as you can smell what is cooking before you go into the kitchen.
Aphsi mothers can tell that babies are hungry or tired before they start to cry.
Aphsi traders always know whether the person they are bargaining with is honest.
And Aphsi thieves are the best in the world:
they can *drome* when a street vendor is sleepy,
or whether a guard is paying more attention to the women washing their hair in the courtyard in front of him
than to the sound of footsteps on the roof over his head.

But not me.
I can't *drome*.
I am *nif*, like you.
I kicked and kicked when I was inside my mother because I couldn't *drome* her trying to soothe me.
Later,
when I was a baby,
I cried whenever my mother or father left the room
because I couldn't *drome* that they were just around the corner.

No one knows why the Aphsi are what they are.
Some people think we have always been that way.
Others blame it on the great spells of the Pilots' last war,
and others—well, I will speak of that in time.

Let me first tell you what it was like to grow up *nif* among children who could *drome*.
They—the other children my age in Medef—used to play a game with me called "surprise".
Sometimes,
when I was watching an anthill or practicing my letters,
they would sneak up behind me and shout, "Bah!"
I would jump, and they would all laugh.
They couldn't imagine what it was like to not know that someone was behind them.
(Did I mention that Aphsi make good guards as well as good thieves?)

I didn't always mind being surprised:
at least it meant the other children were paying attention to me.
Mostly, though, it just made me angry.
I would tell them to stop, or run to my mother and get her to tell them.
They would, but only long enough for me to go back to my ants or my letters
so that they could sneak up behind me again.

I still have a scar—here, on the ball of my thumb—from the time Hediyeh and her friends surprised me
while I was carving a new pawn for Razi's chess set.
I was ten,
and the cut went right down to the bone.
Hediyeh had to go without food for a day as punishment,
and her parents gave my mother a spool of fine green thread to apologize,
but as far as Hediyeh and her friends were concerned that just made it my fault.

In a way, though, that cut is where my story begins.
That cut, and the talk I had with Razi that evening.
He came to our house just as my mother put the last stitch into my thumb.
The two of them sat for a while in the shade garden while I moped around under the awning out back,
picking at my new stitches and feeling sorry for myself.

When they were done talking,
Razi came to fetch me for a game of chess.
"Here," he said, "Let me have a look at that."

"It's nothing," I told him sullenly.
"Let's just play."

He shook his head.
"Show me," he insisted,
taking his embroidered chessboard out of its sleeve
and unrolling it on the ground between us.
I shrugged and held out my hand.
He inspected the four black stitches, then nodded.

"They used to do that to me too. Here, look."
He pulled up his right sleeve.
A beaded scar ran from his elbow to his wrist like a worm track on his skin.
"I got so tired of them sneaking up on me that I climbed a date tree to get away from them.
I sat up there for, *la*, it must have been hours, just watching people come and go."

He laughed.
"It was so peaceful that I fell asleep!
And *hup*, down I fell and broke my arm.
They had to give me poppy juice and cut it open to straighten out the bones."

"I'd break my arm myself if it would stop Hediyeh and the others from playing stupid tricks on me," I grumbled.
I picked up a black pawn, put my hands behind my back, then held my fists out to him.

Razi didn't tap one.
Instead, he snapped his fingers against bad luck.
"You should be careful what you ask for," he warned me.
"*La*, and even more careful what you offer in return."

I knew that tone of voice, and the look in his eyes.
All of a sudden I was even angrier than I had been when I cut my thumb.
What right did he have to pity me?
He was as *nif* as I was!
"Are you going to choose or not?" I asked, waving my fists above the board.

He reached out as if to choose a hand, then grabbed my wrists.
"Open up," he ordered.

"Ow!" I opened my hands.
The black pawn I had taken from the chessboard lay in one.
The one I had spent the day carving lay in the other.

Razi laughed.
"I think I'll take white," he said, letting go of my wrists.

"How did you know?" I asked.

He grinned and pointed at the chessboard.
"You forgot to pick up a white one," he told me.
"If you're going to try to trick someone, *la*, you must plan more than one move ahead."
He scratched the side of his nose.
"For example, think about—what's her name? Hediyeh?"

"I'd rather not," I said sourly.
I had spent hours carving that pawn…

He shook his head.
"Just because you can't *drome*, it doesn't mean you're deaf and blind.
Look at pocket mice.
They can't *drome* either, but have you ever tried to sneak up on one?
They're always listening, always sniffing the air.
If you listen that hard, and learn to pay attention, no-one will ever be able to sneak up on you.
And if you learn to be as still inside as a piece of glass,
then one day maybe you will be able to sneak up on them."

"But *how*?" I was so frustrated that my voice broke.

Razi shrugged his shoulders and twisted his right hand around.
Just like that he had a short, sharp knife in his hand.
The blade was blackened, but sunlight glinted on its edge.
"I can teach you, if you want,"
he said quietly.

I stared at the knife like a pocket mouse staring at a snake.
Razi was more than just a wandering *nif* tinker,
and he was offering me far more than I had realized I was bargaining for.

## Chapter 2

Five years later Razi sat cross-legged in front of his tent in the lemon grove,
weighing feathers in the tin pans of a little balance.
"Have you eaten?" he asked without looking up.

"Yes.
And I brought date bread for lunch.
*Umma* made it yesterday."

He nodded.
"Good."
He took a sand-brown feather from the balance and trimmed it with his knife.
"Canteens are in the tent.
We'll need one each, and a spare."
The balance leveled.
Razi set the feather aside, then removed another from the bag beside him.

By the time I had filled the canteens and returned,
he had trimmed a dozen feathers to exactly the same weight.
He laid them flat in a folded square of paper so that they wouldn't be crushed.
"Finish those later," he said, standing and stretching.
He stooped and pulled his bow case from his tent.
It was a long tube of hard brown leather as tall as I was.
A second tube, shorter and fatter, was his quiver.
Any feather on any arrow in that quiver would level the balance with any other.

The last thing he took was a dark green bottle wrapped in woven leather plaits.
Its stopper was a sword hilt with a plain leather grip.
Razi hung it on his left hip and grinned at me.
"All set?"

I nodded.
My bow was slung over my shoulder in the padded cloth case my mother had made for it.
I had fifteen arrows, each with a barbed steel head, and a machete.

"Good," said Razi.
He clapped me on the shoulder.
"Let's go hunting."

Razi led us south, skirting the ruins of the Pilots' palace before turning inland toward the watchtower.
We played chess as we walked, each telling the other a move every fifty paces.
It's harder than it sounds:
not only do you have to keep the position in your head,
you have to think of a plan while you're counting paces.
It was fun,
but it was also another of Razi's exercises,
training me to keep track of time and distance while I was worrying about other things.

Time and distance are what the desert is about.
How far am I travelling?
When will I run out of water?
After Razi said, "Checkmate," time and distance filled my thoughts.
How much longer would I stay in Medef?
How far could I go when I left?
The furthest I'd ever been was Uef.
It was a tenth the size of Medef, just thirty families living around a spring three days away.
I wanted to see Ossisswe, and Ruuda, and Ini Bantang, and, oh, the whole world.
I wanted to see what a city looked like, a city full of *nif* like me.
I wanted to have adventures
so that I could come back to Medef to tell stories
and have girls like Hediyeh blush and giggle when I walked by,
the way they blushed and giggled when *nif* traders passed through.

I put one foot in front of the other, taking four steps for every three of Razi's.
The sun was half-way to noon when Razi turned east.
We circled around the watchtower hill so that we could come at it from the side closest to the Sea of Glass.
I tried to figure out his plan while we walked.
We would reach the tower mid-afternoon.
That didn't make sense: at that time of day, the breeze would carry our scent straight to the gargoyles.
Unless…

"*La*, am I to be bait?" I asked.

Razi shook his head.
"No, I am."

We reached the beach an hour later.
It was an eerie place.
A thousand years of dry wind had scoured most of the sand away,
leaving a glass shelf that rippled with the shape of ancient waves.
Pieces had cracked and broken over the years,
littering the rock below with sharp-edged shards that could cut even the sturdiest sole.

Razi pointed.
"There's a path down there by three rocks that look like a mother goat and two kids.
Do you know it?"
I nodded.
"Work your way up behind them.
I'll come at them from below."

I nodded again.
"How will I know when you're ready?"

He grinned.
"You'll know."

It took me half an hour to get in position.
I moved from rock to bush,
never taking more than a dozen steps at once,
scanning the sky for slow-circling wings before picking my way to the next bit of cover.
I tried to keep my mind clear, to think only about the next few steps.
I was just a pocket mouse—no,
not even that,
just a wind-blown scrap of tumbleweed.

I was about five hundred paces from the watchtower when the first gargoyle launched herself into the air.
She didn't start flying right away.
Instead,
she plummeted earthward down the side of the tower for a moment to build up speed,
then snapped her wings open with a *crack*
and began spiralling back into the sky on an updraft.

I crouched behind the eroded remains of an old wall and slipped my bow out of its case.
I had waxed its string that morning when I was unable to sleep.
There, in the moment, I cursed the faint smell of honey that still lingered.
I slipped one loop into the catch at the bottom end of the bow,
braced it against my foot,
then bent it and hooked the other end of the string in place in a single motion
the way Razi had taught me.

I swallowed a mouthful of water and set my canteen down in the wall's narrow shadow.
I still had some date bread,
but I couldn't have eaten it then for its weight in pewter.
Instead I pulled the drawstrings at my wrists and ankles tight
so that my sleeves and pantlegs wouldn't catch on anything.

The second female launched herself from the tower.
As she rose to follow the first one
I slipped around the end of the ruined wall
and sprinted to the candelilla bush I'd chosen as my next patch of cover.
I had hunted jackrabbits and sand gulls this way,
watching for the moments when my prey looked away,
inching closer a few paces each time.

Suddenly one of the gargoyles stooped, yipping at the other.
My breath caught.
It must be Razi.
I slipped two arrows from my quiver, put one between my teeth, and raised my head.

The third gargoyle, the male, took wing just as I looked up.
His wingspan was twice that of the females,
and his voice boomed instead of shrieking when he answered their call.
He flapped its wings to gain height.
The two females circled him as he climbed, all three calling to each other.

Razi broke cover and ran straight for the tower,
holding his bow in both hands like a spear for balance.
One of the females screeched and plummeted at him, arms outstretched.
Razi threw himself sideways at the last moment,
rolled over,
and came up on one knee to fire an arrow I hadn't even seen him draw.
It punched through the taut skin of the gargoyle's wing.

The other female swooped in behind her,
herding Razi toward the waiting male who would make the kill.
I sighted,
leading her,
time and distance made reflex by long hours of practice.

Razi ran again toward the tower again.
The second female cut across his path to cut him off.
He checked himself so that she overshot,
but the male was right behind her.
Razi jabbed at him with his bow.
The male stumbled in the air as it hit his wing,
one taloned foot raking Razi's scalp.

I fired my first arrow as the male started to climb.
It passed harmlessly behind him.
I pulled another from my quiver.
I could taste the one between my teeth,
my snapshot arrow.

There was blood on Razi's face.
He had two arrows out himself, one in his teeth, one strung.
As the first female dove a second time, he fired, drew, fired again.
The second shot hit her shoulder, cutting some vital muscle or tendon.
She tumbled sideways as her wing crumpled.

The male bellowed five stories above Razi's head.
I drew, exhaled, and let fly.
My arrow hit him square in the chest.
The impact knocked him sideways in the air.
My snapshot arrow struck his leg a moment later,
but I think he was already dead.
He turned over once as he fell.

The second female shrieked and banked away.
I saw Razi aim, then lower his bow.
She was too far away and moving too fast.

I ran to him as he wiped blood from his face with his sleeve.
"Are you all right?" I asked.

He glared at his sleeve as if blaming it for being stained.
"No. Where's the spare canteen?"

"You have it," I said, pointing.
He turned his glare on me.
Then his look softened and he chuckled.

"*La*, so I do."
He handed me his bow, unstoppered the canteen, and splashed some water onto his face.
"Gaaah… I'm a mess."

Something rustled behind me.
I whirled around.
The female that Razi had shot had struggled to her feet.
Her right wing hung uselessly at her side.
She chittered,
clutching feebly at the arrow that had passed through the complicated double joint
where arm and wing joined body.

Razi wiped some more blood from his face.
"Here, give me that."
He took his bow back from me and drew an arrow.
The female just stood there on her short, bandy legs and watched with all-too-human eyes
as Razi sighted carefully and put an arrow through her heart.

## Chapter 3

We walked back to the lemon grove in somber silence,
leaving the gargoyles' bodies where they were to feed the desert.
They had been taking Grappa Uzman's goats.
He had suggested building a fire in the base of the tower to drive them away,
but Razi had said no,
they would just come back when the smoke was gone.
And anyway,
how would we fuel the fire?
Nothing near the tower would burn—did *sri* Uzman really want
to spend a week carrying loads of dried camel dung?

If someone else had asked that,
Grappa Uzman would have puffed up his chest and said yes,
he would do it.
Then one of his daughters would put her hand on his arm and gentled him
the way he gentled his goats when storms came.
But somehow,
coming from Razi,
the words made the idea seem so silly that they both laughed.
I was trying to figure out how Razi did that,
but it was proving harder to learn than the bow.

The sun was down by the time we reached the hill above the palace.
The moon hung low over the Sea of Glass,
a mottled diamond whose light turned the frozen waves into irregular bands of light and shadow.
Beneath us, the Pilots' ancient stronghold glistened
as if it had been painted with teardrops.
Music still rose faintly from its walls
a thousand years and more after its builders had destroyed themselves.

"Look," Razi said, pointing.
At first I didn't see anything,
but then motion caught my eye.
A sandy desert hare stood on his haunches,
sniffing the wind,
while its tribe snuffled and nibbled among the eucalyptus trees that grew next to the palace walls.
I saw a splash in the aqueduct behind them as a fish jumped for a night fly.
The hares froze,
ready to scatter,
then returned to their search for dinner,
the moment already forgotten.

"Do you want help?" I asked,
gesturing at the bandage wrapped around Razi's head.
He nodded, and we started down the hill.

The aqueduct ran from the center of the palace all the way to the village.
It was rough-edged sandstone,
human work,
and seemed half-finished compared to the smooth curved sparkle of the palace.
A square pool bulged out of the aqueduct's side every hundred strides or so.
I filled our canteens at the first of these
as Razi unwrapped his bandage and handed it to me.
Splashing some water on its end, I dabbed at the gash the gargoyle had given him,
jumping only slightly when another little fish went *ploop* beside us.

"*La*, that will do," Razi eventually said.
He fingered the gash's edges gingerly.
"How does it look?"

"Like someone tried to open up your head."
I rolled up the bandage—we would boil it clean later—and yawned.

Razi grinned. "It is past your bedtime."

I nodded.
It had been a long day.
We picked up our gear and trudged up to Razi's tent in the lemon grove.
Their blossoms gave the air a sharp,
clean edge.

A clay pot held closed with twine sat in wait.
Undoing the knot, Razi lifted the lid and sniffed.
"Mm."
Goat stew with chilis and pomegranates—one of Grappa Uzman's many daughters or granddaughters
must have brought it as payment for the day's work.
Razi held it out to me.

I shook my head.
"*Umma* will be waiting."
My mother always stayed up when I was out with Razi.
I knew because our neighbors complained that her worrying kept them awake.

Razi set the pot down and raised his palms to me.
"You did well today."

"Not well enough."
The whole way home,
I'd been thinking about missing my first shot.

He clapped me on the shoulder.
"Yes, well enough.
Now *la*, get some sleep.
We'll talk tomorrow."
He pushed me gently toward home.

I read once that the name "Aphsi" comes from
an old Thindi phrase *aph e sessi*, meaning, "the quiet people".
If you were to walk through Medef after dark,
you would understand why.
Most of the conversations people surround themselves with
don't really convey any information.
Their purpose is reassurance:
you are safe, your friends are here.

Aphsi don't need that.
They can *drome* whether all is well or not.
There was a drum in the village square to sound the alarm
in case of bandits or fire,
but most of the villagers would never think to use it.
The only sounds that night as I walked home were the goats,
the birds,
and Jephel playing the flute.

He and Mureya were sitting on an old palm log people used as a bench.
He broke off when he caught sight of me and waved.
I waved back,
not breaking stride,
but then he asked,
"How did it go?"

I sighed under my breath.
"All right."
He shuffled sideways to make room for me,
not noticing the uncomfortable look on Mureya's face.
She could *drome* that I didn't want to stop and talk—not with Jephel, anyway..

But Jephel was *nif* like me, and he wanted to know the details.
There had been three?
And we'd killed them all?
Oh, but Razi was hurt?
He spoke so slowly that I couldn't help but interrupt every third sentence.
He didn't seem to mind,
but Jephel never seemed to mind anything:
not his chores,
or the teasing of the other children,
or the names they had called him when his parents apprenticed him to the village butcher.
The only time I'd ever seen him angry was
when Hediyeh and some of the other girls teased Mureya for holding his hand.
I don't know what they *dromed*,
but they never did it again.

I finally ran out of patience.
"I'm sorry," I said,
"But it's been a long day, and *umma* will be wondering where I am."

"Of course, of course."
He ducked his head.
"I'm sure everyone will be pleased that you took care of it."
He laughed.
"It's not like I could have."

"Thanks."
I raised a hand and hurried away.
Behind me,
he started playing again,
a slow love song that the girls always asked for.

My mother was waiting for me at the door with a soft smile on her face.
"We got them," I said unnecessarily.
She nodded and held up my festival *deel*
to show me that she had finished sewing new cuffs on the sleeves,
then set it aside to give me a quick hug.

I dropped my gear and sat on a pillow on the floor,
reaching up to take the bowl of rice and peppers she handed me.
Ten minutes later I was asleep on the slat bed
in the curtained alcove that had been mine since I turned ten.
My mother had put fresh sprigs of mint and lemon under my pillow.
I think I dreamed of desert hares, and of moonlight on the Sea of Glass,
but after so many years it is hard to remember.

My mother shook me awake.
"Razi wants you."
Her voice was soft and urgent.
"Now."

It was an hour before dawn.
I dipped my fingers in the washbowl and ran them through my hair,
slipped my *deel* over my head,
and hurried out the door with my sandals still in my hand.
A moment later I doubled back to grab my bow
and the pack I had carried the day before.

A dayglass lantern cast dull orange light over two dozen people
in the village square.
I didn't need to be able to *drome* to know they were worried.
Razi had taken the bandage off his head.
The gash was already scabbed over,
and not for the first time,
I wondered about how quickly he healed.
"What's happening?"

He pointed at a bald man in the center of the crowd
I had never seen before.
"He says he is from a caravan heading to Ossisswe.
They were attacked by bandits,
and lost half of their livestock and most of their water."

"The lion?"

Razi gave a quick, angry jerk of his head.
"*La*, that is my thought also.
They need help to round up what's left of their animals."

"Which would empty out the village."

Razi nodded again.
"*La*, just so."

Grappa Uzman broke off talking to the stranger and beckoned us over.
Jephel was there,
and Yassen the butcher,
and Yassen's brother Kirash who did whatever chores people would give him
and drank too much—all the village *nif*.
"Here is Mogen ay Egen a Dudir," Grappa Uzman said,
introducing the stranger to us in the formal way:
Dudir, the son of Mogen the mother and Eben the father.

"I am Razibendra uy-Ossisswe," Razi replied, raising his palms.
Up close,
the stranger was younger than I had thought—no more than eighteen.
His head was shaved,
not bald,
and his bare arms were as thick as my thighs.

Dudir raised his palms in return,
then grasped Razi's hand in the city way.
"My father told me to look for you.
He said you could help."

"*La*, if I can."
Razi turned to Grappa Uzman and raised his voice so everyone could hear.
"With your leave, grappa, I will take Kirash and half a dozen to find their animals.
Everyone else should stay here and keep watch."

"Half a dozen?" Dudir's dismay made him sound angry.
"We lost two hundred goats last night!
We'll never find them all with just half a dozen people!"

Razi grinned. "Half a dozen *Aphsi*," he corrected.

Two minutes later they were on their way out of the village
and Yassen, Jephel, and I were on the roof of the bakery.
Yassen had fetched his bow—like me, he had been taught to use it when he was young.
Jephel had been taught too,
but had never amounted to more than a danger to himself.
There was nothing wrong with his eyes,
though,
or with his patience.
If the lion and her bandits came within a hundred strides of any villager, they would know.
Our job was to spot them if they didn't.

Yassen nudged me with his elbow and passed me a stoppered jug of lemon water.
I took a sip and passed it to Jephel,
my eyes on the hills south and east of the village.
The sun was just coming up,
casting long autumn shadows tinged green-blue at the edges.
If anything moved, we would—

"There," Yassen said flatly, pointing.
I looked north.
Nothing, nothing…I saw it,
a dark outline that changed shape as it moved.
I counted three, four, and then a fifth,
larger,
on four legs instead of two.
It was the lion.

"Pass me a rag," Yassen ordered.
Silently,
Jephel handed him a scrap of cotton cloth.
As Yassen wound it around the head of an arrow,
Jephel uncorked the brown bottle Yassen had "borrowed" from his brother.
The sharp smell that came from it was the evil twin of the lemon water's tang.

Yassen splashed some of the alcohol on the rag, then cursed.
"Didn't bring any matches."

I had some, wrapped in waxed paper in my *deel*,
along with a sewing needle and a toothpick.
A scratch and a touch later,
the rag on the arrow was alight.

Yassen set it carefully on the string, drew, and let fly.
The flame fluttered and died before the arrow arced down
to strike an innocent patch of candelilla.

"Do you think they saw it?" Jephel asked.

The morning shadows were already shorter than they had been,
but knowing where to look,
I saw the bandits slipping away into the desert.
"She saw it," I said.
Lions only attack when they have the element of surprise.
We would stay on the roof and watch
in case she and her humans were desperate enough to try without that,
but the excitement was over.

## Chapter 4

The caravan straggled into Medef an hour later,
trailing an ochre plume of dust.
From the bakery roof,
I counted ten carts and thirty people:
eleven on camels,
six in carts,
and the rest on foot.
A short string of pack camels trailed behind the last cart
in brightly-colored harnesses.
As I watched,
the knots holding a round-cornered box on one camel's back came loose.
It tumbled to the ground and broke open,
spilling dark cloth bags holding buttons or spices onto the trail.
A woman in a red and gray *deel* rushed over
and beat the camel's flank with her palms to get it to stop,
cursing when it didn't even break stride.

One cart stood out from the rest.
It was drawn by a pair of burros
instead of one of the humpless camels the other carters used,
and its spoked wheels would have come up to my armpits.
Whatever occupied it was securely wrapped in dark blue canvas
held in place with enough rope to rig a tents.
Its driver sat with his back against his cargo
and the burros' reins loose in his hand.
He wore darkly-patterned *deel* and a bright yellow turban,
which meant either that he was from Ossisswe,
or that he was a scholar,
or that he liked the color yellow.

I nudged Yassen with my elbow.
He sat up and scratched his beard with both hands.
Jephel glanced at him,
then at me,
then went back to watching the hills where we had seen the lion and her thieves.

"Sorry looking bunch, aren't they?" Yassen said sourly.
He was right:
when Razi had said "caravan",
I had expected fifty carts or more.
Medef saw two that size each year,
one for the examination festival in Ossisswe,
the other three months later
when merchants from the Salt Coast who were willing to risk the deep desert
came through on their way to Coriandel.
They brought dayglass, chocolate, silk, mace, coral, fine leather, and books.
Looking at the tired faces below me,
I wondered if anyone in this "caravan" could even read.

Yassen stood and stretched.
The sun was a handspan past noon,
and the heat made the bakery roof feel like the ovens beneath us.
"I need to fiss," he grumbled,
lifting the palmed roof-hatch 
and clambering down the ladder into the cool dark below.

"Can we get some water?" Jephel asked.
He held up his canteen and shook it to show it was empty.

"I'll send some up."
The closing hatch muffled his words.

Jephel sighed.
"No he won't," he said philosophically,
long accustomed to people forgetting about him.

"Here."
I tossed my canteen at him.
Being thirsty would be better than listening to him not complain.

As the caravan approached,
a handful of villagers busied themselves in the posting yard.
Palm tree logs stood in a rough grid, twelve strides to a side.
Ropes were quickly strung on the pulleys hanging from their tops.
Squares of canvas,
each big enough to cover the roof I was sitting on,
were laid across the ropes and hauled into place
to form a single great awning over the fairground.
The southern and eastern sides were blocked by more canvas
to keep out the hot afternoon wind.

A hundred strides away,
four men strained to raise the sluice gate at the end of the aqueduct.
Anywhere else in the Karaband,
they would have chanted, "*Heph…ho!*" to stay in time.
But they were Aphsi,
so they worked in silence.

The sluice gate finally gave in with a screech of stone on stone.
Water poured from the aqueduct into the pipe that led to the fairground,
where it splashed into a short trough that in turn spilled into a longer one.
People would wash their hands and food in the first,
while animals would drink from the second.

Two sharp whistles cut through the bustle.
I shielded my eyes with my hand
as Razi and the villagers who had gone with him
came over the horizon in the midst of a hundred or more goats.
There wouldn't be any stragglers:
if a goat was alive,
an Aphsi would have *dromed* it and brought it in.

The caravan's lead cart reached the stone gate that marked the edge of Medef.
Its driver was the bald man who had come for help that morning.
Beside him sat an older man with the same brawny arms,
eagle-beak nose,
and shaven head.
Grappa Uzman and Granna Efiyeh raised their palms to the pair in welcome.
A few strides further on,
Hediyeh and some of the other girls stood in a cluster,
their hands tucked politely in their sleeves
and their faces shadowed by the hoods of their *deels*.
I watched Hediyeh's head turn to follow the cart as it passed her.
As the carter's son turned to look back,
something prickled up my spine.
