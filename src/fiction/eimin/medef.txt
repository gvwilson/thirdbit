People compare the desert to many different things. The pirates of Ini
Bantang and Barra Bantang say it is like the ocean: broad, trackless,
and completely indifferent to the fates of those who travel across it.
The tribesmen of Darp say it is just a hot, barren version of their own
great plains, while the Avauntois who look down on the Karaband from
their flying mountain simply shrug and say, "It's brown, and boring."
The silver-masked priests and princesses of Thind think it is like their
own country, full of lost cities, caravans cursed to wander forever,
monsters left over from the Angels' Disputation, and revenge.

All of these things are true, but none of them are right.

---

Thind has been an empire for a thousand years. At times, its masked
rulers have governed everything from the Wise River in the north to Ini
Bantang in the south, and from Cap di Perçalle in the west to the East
Pole itself---everything, of course, except the dragon's isles. It has
twice been conquered by the Darpani, and twice more torn itself to
pieces with magic in a human echo of the Angels' Disputation.

Today, people say of the Thindi that they never do anything for the
first time. They have a ritual for everything: a new year's first cup of
tea, the beginning or end of marriage negotiations with a business
acquaintance, the death of a favorite pet. They have rules for how one
should dress, too, rules so precise that they leave almost nothing to
whim. If you see a man wearing a *dhoti* folded two finger widths below
his navel, a turban knotted in the rear, and rope sandals with
unbleached tie strings, you may know that he is the unlettered youngest
son of a peasant family that does not own its own hippo. Put a plain
shawl on his shoulders, and you may know that he can read; knot his
turban differently, and you proclaim that he is the oldest son, or a
middle child (whom the Thindi consider unlucky, since they cause so much
trouble).

In the Karaband, on the other hand, people are proud of the fact that no
two *deels* are exactly alike. We lengthen them, shorten them, add
pockets in common or unlikely places, reinforce the shoulders if we
frequently carry heavy loads... Over time, every *deel* learns from its
wearer how to do its job better, and every Karabandi learns how to read
a person's life from their *deel*.

I ran. I ran like a jackrabbit runs, like a hawk flies. I ran like I had
never run before. Cold sick fear lay heavy in my gut. The moon was
already half-way up the sky. I'm not going to make it, I thought, then
ran even faster.

I stumbled just before the top of the hill, scraping my hands and knees
as I fell. I knelt there panting for a moment, then struggled back to my
feet and kept going. The only sounds were my breathing and the steady
crunch of my sandals, left, right, left, right. Razi's sword bumped
against my hip every second step. I had to find Suresh, and stop him.

I reached the top of the hill. The palace shone in the moonlight. I
could smell lemon trees and moist earth. There! Someone was standing in
the shadows by the palace gate. No, wait, there were two people, and
they were kissing.

It was Suresh and Hediyeh. She pushed him away, then grabbed his wrists
and pulled him back. They kissed again. Good, I thought coldly. As long
as they're doing that, I don't have to worry about being seen. I cleared
my throat, spat, and started running again.

The path dipped behind a shoulder of the hill. When I could see the
palace again, the gate was open, and they were gone. Then I was running
through rows of eucalyptus, neat and square.

The trees stopped two dozen strides from the gate. I slowed to a walk,
drawing Razi's sword. The quicksilver blade took shape with a soft
gurgle, like water being poured from a jug. Heart pounding, I stepped
through the gate.

The palace music played softly around me. I let out my breath with a
whoosh. It would have stopped if the spell had already been broken.
There was still time. I closed my eyes. My heart was pounding in my
chest. I imagined calming it, soothing it, as if it were a frightened
pocket mouse. Suresh couldn't *drome*---at least, I hoped he
couldn't---but Hediyeh certainly could. Sh, be still, be still, I
thought. I imagined myself petting my heart gently, rubbing its ears,
brushing its soft fur. I imagined it growing still under my hand, until
it did.

I opened my eyes. My moonshadow was just two fingers wide. There wasn't
much time left. I trotted across the outer courtyard on the balls of my
feet and took the stairs two at a time. I was calm. I was certain. I was
as clear as your breath, empty, a quiet stream flowing without a ripple
or a wave.

I pressed myself against the wall next to the open door, then craned my
head to look into the greeting room. Empty. I slipped inside. They had
probably gone through the inner courtyard to the pool. I ran the other
way, to the audience room. A side door opened onto a narrow stairway
that led up to a window set just below the roof. When the palace was in
use, a servant would have stood there to watch for guests arriving. It
didn't overlook the pool, but it was big enough for me to squeeze
through.

I pushed Razi's sword back into its bottle, corking it with the handle.
The window was waist-high. I put both hands on the sill and hopped up
onto it, tucking my feet underneath me. It wasn't quite tall enough for
me to stand, so I leaned out, one hand on the wall for balance, the
other reaching up for the edge of the roof. The stone felt cool against
my skin. I took a breath, let go of the wall, and stepped out.

My whole weight hung from one hand for a heartbeat until my other hand
found purchase. I pulled myself up onto the roof and drew Razi's sword
once again. The stones were dark and discolored where the brief puddles
left behind by occasional storms had dried. I hunched down and crept
forward.

Suresh and Hediyeh were already in the pool, laughing and splashing.
Their clothes lay at the pool's edge. Suresh's body and legs were pale
in the moonlight, though his hands and feet and face were bark brown.
Hediyeh---Hediyeh was all one color. That's all I want to say.

Suresh lunged forward, catching Hediyeh's foot. "Stop it! Stop it!" she
squealed as he tickled her. He let go, then dove, swam beneath her,
popped up behind her, and flicked water off his fingers into her eyes as
she turned around.

"Stop!" she giggled. She wiped her face. "You swim so well. You're like
a fish."

"Thank you. I practically grew up in the water back home." He slipped
around her, heading for his clothes. "Used to spend pretty much every
summer in the lake, looking for treasure."

"Treasure? Really?" Hediyeh dog-paddled after him. I shifted my weight.
What was he doing?

"Well, no, I mean, there wasn't really any treasure." He glanced up at
the moon, then back at Hediyeh. He was at the edge of the pool now. "But
I was, I don't know, seven, maybe eight, and there was this story about
a boy who found a gold necklace and a helmet once. It was a true story,
too." He kicked himself up a few inches so that he could reach out and
pull his clothes closer.

"You're not getting out already, are you?" Hediyeh pouted.

"What? No, no, I'm just... Anyway, the boy sold them in Ossisswe, then
bought a whole herd of goats and lived happily ever after." Suresh
pulled something out of the pocket of his trousers and turned back to
Hediyeh.

"So did you ever find anything?" she asked.

"Mm hm." He held up the ring. It sparkled in the moonlight.

"Oh! Let me see!" He held it out, then pulled it away just before she
took it.

"Come and get it," he grinned. He wriggled away from her, drawing her
toward him, always out of reach. He was leading her closer to the
waterstone, directly beneath me. I tensed.

"Oh, stop teasing!" Hediyeh paddled forward. I slipped my feet out of my
sandals. Suresh was almost close enough. Almost...

Suddenly he stopped backing away. He looked up at the sky. "It's time,"
he said, and he slipped the ring onto his finger.

Hediyeh screamed in shock as the ancient haunt flooded into Suresh. He
lunged forward and grabbed her arm. "Let go! Let go!" she shrieked. She
tried to pull away, but he was too strong. He pulled her close, spinning
her around so that he could get his other arm around her neck. The ring
throbbed with red light, making the water look like blood had already
been spilled in it.

I splashed into the pool an arm's length away. My feet hit the bottom
hard. I pushed off, so that I shot halfway back out of the water again.
Hediyeh screamed again. I raised my arm. The quicksilver blade of the
sword licked the night above us. "Let go of her!" I ordered.

"Eimin!" Suresh tightened his grip on Hediyeh's neck, choking off her
scream. "What are you---"

"Let go!" I twisted in the water and feinted at him. The sword blade
snapped like a whip just inches from his head.

"Eimin, no, wait, listen to me. Listen! You have to let me do this.
Eimin, it's for both of us." He glanced up at the moon again. "Please,
Eimin, think! Think about what they did to you. Think about what they
kept from you! Once I have the power that's in that stone, I can undo
that. I can make you like everyone else. We can stop them from ever
doing it to anyone ever again. Please, Eimin, I know what you're
thinking, but it's the only way."

"You don't know what I'm thinking," I said. I flicked the sword at him
again to try to back him away from the stone. He didn't flinch this
time. The blade caught his shoulder, leaving a thin red line that
immediately started to drip. His ring brightened.

"So is that it? Are you going to be a pawn all your life, when you could
be a king?" Hediyeh pulled at his arm. Her mouth was open, her eyes
bulged. She couldn't breathe. He was choking her while he talked to me.

"I don't know what I'm going to be," I told him. I flicked the sword
again. "All I know is that you're a liar. Nobody did this to me. Nobody
made me this way. My mother wouldn't let them."

His face hardened. He took a deep breath. He was going to dive. Hediyeh
had almost stopped struggling. He was going to dive and give her death
to the stone. I was out of time.

I lunged forward. Razi's sword went right through the joint of Hediyeh's
shoulder and into Suresh's ribs. She tried to scream, but couldn't. He
could. He did. His scream was rage and pain and a thousand years of
being trapped in a little shard of glass.

He shouted a word and slapped the sword blade with the hand that wore
the ring. The blade snapped like a dry twig. He rolled in the water and
dove. I dropped the broken sword and went after him.

His ring was so bright now that it cast red-tinged shadows. Hediyeh was
limp in his arms. Dark blood made the water murky. He grabbed the corner
of the waterstone with one hand to steady himself and held her down
against it with the other. Air bubbled out of his mouth as he began the
spell.

I frog-kicked over to him and grabbed his arm. He tried to beat me away,
but the water took the force of the blow away. I was already running out
of air. The ring was blinding me. I let go of him, grabbed Hediyeh's
arm, and planted my feet on the waterstone to try to pull her away.

Cold... I have never felt cold like that. It was as if ice water was
flooding into my veins. The waterstone wanted. The cold rose through my
legs, into my body. I pulled weakly at Hediyeh's arm. It was too late.
The cold was in my heart, sucking all my strength away. I couldn't---

I twisted, and with the last of my strength I let go of Hediyeh and
jammed my fingers into Suresh's mouth to stop the spell. He bit them in
surprise, then tried to pull his head away. He couldn't let go of the
waterstone. He couldn't let go of Hediyeh. He couldn't get away from me,
so he tried to spit them out, but I hung on. I was actually holding on
to his bottom teeth for an instant.

The red glow started to fade. He shook his head from side to side
frantically. I was so cold. I couldn't feel my legs any more. The glow
flickered and died. In the last of its light I caught a glimpse of
Suresh's face. Whatever was in there looked back at me full of hate and
despair and longing, and then it was gone.

The next thing I remember I was lying on my back looking up at the
stars. I didn't know where I was. I knew I was cold, but I didn't have
the energy to fetch a blanket. My mother would look in on me in a while.
She could always *drome* when I was awake, when I was too hot or too
cold. She'd take care of me.

I blinked and turned my head as Suresh dragged Hediyeh out of the pool.
I must have made a sound, because he looked at me. Our eyes met. He
shook his head slowly and started to sob. I closed my eyes again.

---

When I woke again, Razi was beside me. He had cut his shirt into strips,
and was bandaging Hediyeh's shoulder. Suresh was gone.

"Cold..." I whispered. He nodded without looking at me, intent on his
work.

"I'll build a fire as soon as I can. She's lost a lot of blood." He
knotted another strip of shirt under her armpit, then sat back and
rubbed his ankle. "What happened?"

"Suresh...?"

Razi shook his head. "Gone. But he left this." He held up a small glass
ring. It was just glass, now. Whatever had been in it had missed its
chance.

I tried to sit up, but I was too weak. It was like one of those bad
dreams where you're a puppet whose strings have been cut, so that you
can see and hear, but you can't move. "Can't ..." I gasped. For some
reason it seemed funny to me. I started to chuckle, but it turned into a
wheeze.

Razi frowned. "Well, then who fished you out of the---oh. Hm.
Interesting." He turned the ring over in his hand thoughtfully, then
tucked it into his pocket and struggled to his feet. "And where's my
damn sword? If there's even a scratch on it..."

In the end, I went for help, so that Razi could stay and look after
Hediyeh. It wasn't a good idea. I only had to walk as far as the goat
pasture, but it seemed to take as long as my trek out to the fleet. I
stumbled lightheadedly straight into the arms of Grappa Uzman. I don't
know how much sense he made of the story I told him, but it frightened
him enough for him to send one of his grandsons back to Medef for help.
I fell asleep, shivering, as the sun came up.

It was a month before my strength returned. I spent most of that time
sleeping, or sitting on the roof, watching the world go by. A pair of
sand pigeons built a nest in the eucalyptus tree beside our house in
that month. Little Ashwara took her first steps. And somehow, Hediyeh
became a hero.

I'm still not quite sure how that happened. The waterstone had taken
even more out of her than me, and for a few days the wound in her
shoulder---the wound I'd given her---looked like it was going to go bad.
Once she was well enough to sit up and talk, though, her room was never
empty. Everyone wanted to hear the story from her, over and over,
grownups and children alike. Or maybe they could just *drome* how much
she enjoyed telling it.

Razi came to see me every day. One morning he brought three people with
him, two men and a woman. The two men asked me questions, over and over,
patiently, drawing every little detail of the story out of me. The woman
just listened and frowned.

Razi came back into my room after they left and turned his left hand
over, palm up, palm down, meaning, "The Other Hand". I nodded. I had
guessed as much. They didn't look like Razi, any more than any other
Aphsi, but there was something in their eyes, sadness and patience and
acceptance and watchfulness all at once.

"They still haven't found your friend," he said. "Someone took water and
food from the cache at Tin Point, but there's no trail. We asked Lady
Kembe to try a spell, but even she couldn't find him."

"Do you think he's dead?" I asked.

Razi shook his head. "Dead men can't hide that well. Oh, but here, I
almost forgot. This is for you." He brought his arm out from behind his
back and handed me a chessboard in a leather sleeve, and a cloth bag
full of pieces.

"Thanks. Thanks, Razi." I slipped the board out of its sleeve. "Do you
have time for a game?"

He grinned. "Always." He pulled the little lopsided table I'd made over
beside my hammock, then sat on the stool on the other side. Razi took
the bag from me and poured the pieces onto the board. A moment later he
held up two fists. "Choose."

I laughed. "Either." He laughed too, then opened his hands to show me a
pair of white pawns.
