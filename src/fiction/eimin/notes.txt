# Eimin

- *Eimin* is a YA fantasy novella about a teenage boy trying to find his place in the world.
  - 32,000 words / 20 chapters.
- Most people in Eimin's village (Medef) are Aphsi (empaths): they can *drome* the feelings of others.
  - But Eimin is *nif* (the equivalent of deaf), which makes him feel socially awkward.
    - Almost all *nif* are male.
  - Being *nif* is a metaphor for deafness, but also for being on the spectrum and feeling that you don't understand people.
  - The story should appeal to bookish kids who feel that they never quite fit in.
- The story is told in the first person from Eimin's point of view.
  - Occasional asides give the impression that he is actually telling the story to the reader.

## Major Characters

- Eimin (protagonist): male, 16, born and raised in Medef (more below).
- Hediyeh (antagonist): female, also 16, born and raised in Medef.
  - Enjoys other people's hurt the way some people enjoy the taste of ripe cheese.
  - Knows that Eimin has a crush on her, but dismisses him (both because he's *nif* and because she's mean).
- Suresh (antagonist): male, 20, a traveling magician disguised as a printer and bookseller.
  - Initially friendly to both Eimin and Hediyeh, but alienates Eimin by growing closer to Hediyeh.
  - Turns out that he wants to sacrifice Hediyeh to increase his power.
- Razi: a *nif* of Eimin's mother's age who visits Medef two or three times a year.
  - He is one of Lady Kembe's "hands in the world" (does the practical things she can't).
  - Becomes Eimin's teacher, but we later discover that he is training Eimin to be part of the Other Hand.
  - Razi doesn't know how old he is or where he comes from (he suspects as a result of some old spell).

### More about Eimin

  - Eimin blames himself, even though his mother has told him that she and his father just fell out of love.

## More About the Setting

- Medef was a minor port on an inlet in Lake Karaband before the Disputation.
  - Lake Karaband became the Sea of Glass.
  - Ships, fish, etc. trapped in the glass, bits above the surface eroded away.
  - Glass itself is now cloudy, but here and there things can still be seen.
  - Cracks in the glass filled with windblown dirt and a few hardy plants.
- The Pilots' Palace (really just a small summer house).
  - Everything built to a larger-than-human scale.
  - Home to ghosts: nobody sleeps near it (or goes near it at all unless they're desperate or brave).
  - Voices tempting people inside…
- The ghost in Suresh's ring guides him to what he thinks is treasure.
  - Actually a human magician wanting to be released after being trapped for a thousand years.
- Magicians must trade parts of themselves for power.
  - Eimin makes a bitter comment about getting nothing in exchange for being *nif*.
  - Razi chides him: most people in the world don't either.
- The Pilots could trade parts of other people.
  - People have been trying to regain that power since their fall.
  - Foreshadows the big reveal in a later book: humans are magic fuel
    - The Pilots' Disputation was about the morality of that.
- Suresh does stage magic as well as the real thing.
  - "I'm an entertainer."
  - Has the social ease that Eimin craves.
- Suresh wants to change the past
  - The ghost in the ring is lying about being able to do that.
- Suresh lies to Eimin about magicians creating *nif* for the Other Hand.
  - Eimin's realization that his mother wouldn't do that to him is his character turning point.
  - As is his realization that Razi would.
- People can drome that Suresh is going to betray Hediyeh, but they think that means she's going to move on.
  - Hediyeh enjoys practicing being forlorn.
- Kirash is a warning to Jephel.

## Outline

### Chapter 1

Eimin, a Karabandi listener, describes his childhood in Medef,
where most people are Aphsi who can *drome* emotions.
He is *nif* (equivalent of deaf) and cannot,
which leaves him isolated and occasionally bullied by other Aphsi children,
particularly a girl his own age named Hediyeh.
A cruel prank brings him closer to Razi,
an older *nif* who reveals that he too was once bullied
and teaches Eimin that careful attention and planning can compensate for the lack of *droming*.
Their conversation ends with Razi offering to train Eimin.

### Chapter 2

Five years later, Eimin is Razi's apprentice,
and joins him on a hunt to for gargoyles who are pillaging Medef livestock.
Razi deliberately acts as bait,
giving Eimin a chance to kill one of the gargoyles.

### Chapter 3

Eimin and Razi return to Medef that evening.
Eimin contrasts Aphsi emotional awareness with his own feelings of social clumsiness.
His sleep is interrupted when news arrives that a caravan has been attacked near Medef
by bandits led by a Gifted (intelligent) lion.
Razi leads a small group to recover the caravan's livestock
while Eimin and two other *nif* stay behind,
driving off an abortive raid by the lion and her bandits.

### Chapter 4

The small caravan arrives in Medef.
As the villagers welcome it,
Eimin notices Hediyeh and one of the caravaneers exchange looks.
That caravaneer, Suresh, turns out to have a small printing press
and a stock of books, paper, and brushes.
He and Eimin strike up a conversation.

People compare the desert to many different things. The pirates of Ini
Bantang and Barra Bantang say it is like the ocean: broad, trackless,
and completely indifferent to the fates of those who travel across it.
The tribesmen of Darp say it is just a hot, barren version of their own
great plains, while the Avauntois who look down on the Karaband from
their flying mountain simply shrug and say, "It's brown, and boring."
The silver-masked priests and princesses of Thind think it is like their
own country, full of lost cities, caravans cursed to wander forever,
monsters left over from the Angels' Disputation, and revenge.

All of these things are true, but none of them are right.

---

Thind has been an empire for a thousand years. At times, its masked
rulers have governed everything from the Wise River in the north to Ini
Bantang in the south, and from Cap di Perçalle in the west to the East
Pole itself---everything, of course, except the dragon's isles. It has
twice been conquered by the Darpani, and twice more torn itself to
pieces with magic in a human echo of the Angels' Disputation.

Today, people say of the Thindi that they never do anything for the
first time. They have a ritual for everything: a new year's first cup of
tea, the beginning or end of marriage negotiations with a business
acquaintance, the death of a favorite pet. They have rules for how one
should dress, too, rules so precise that they leave almost nothing to
whim. If you see a man wearing a *dhoti* folded two finger widths below
his navel, a turban knotted in the rear, and rope sandals with
unbleached tie strings, you may know that he is the unlettered youngest
son of a peasant family that does not own its own hippo. Put a plain
shawl on his shoulders, and you may know that he can read; knot his
turban differently, and you proclaim that he is the oldest son, or a
middle child (whom the Thindi consider unlucky, since they cause so much
trouble).

In the Karaband, on the other hand, people are proud of the fact that no
two *deels* are exactly alike. We lengthen them, shorten them, add
pockets in common or unlikely places, reinforce the shoulders if we
frequently carry heavy loads... Over time, every *deel* learns from its
wearer how to do its job better, and every Karabandi learns how to read
a person's life from their *deel*.
