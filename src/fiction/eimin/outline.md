# Eimin

- *Eimin* is a YA fantasy novel about a teenage boy trying to find his place in the world.
  - Most people in his village (Medef) are Aphsi (empaths): they can *drome* the feelings of others.
  - But Eimin is *nif* (the equivalent of deaf), which makes him feel socially awkward.
    - Almost all *nif* are male.
  - Being *nif* is a metaphor for deafness, but also for being on the spectrum and feeling that you don't understand people.
  - The story should appeal to bookish kids who feel that they never quite fit in.
- The story is told in the first person from Eimin's point of view.
  - Occasional asides give the impression that he is actually telling the story to the reader.

- Problem: need action to sustain the story between the opening and the climax.
  - Something that foreshadows Suresh's betrayal.
  - Something involving the lion bandit and the gargoyles.
- Caravan is attacked on its way to Medef.
  - Lion and her bandits growing more desperate because of increasing drought (foreshadow bigger theme).
  - Eimin and Razi leads the caravan across the narrow strait in the Sea of Glass.
    - This is where they have to drive off the gargoyles (?).
- Three-part structure
  - Rescuing the caravan.
  - Suresh in Medef.
  - Eimin's crisis and the resolution.

## Major Characters

- Eimin (protagonist): male, 16, born and raised in Medef (more below).
- Hediyeh (antagonist): female, also 16, born and raised in Medef.
  - Enjoys other people's hurt the way some people enjoy the taste of ripe cheese.
  - Knows that Eimin has a crush on her, but dismisses him (both because he's *nif* and because she's mean).
- Suresh (antagonist): male, 20, a traveling magician with a love of books.
  - Initially friendly to both Eimin and Hediyeh, but alienates Eimin by growing closer to Hediyeh.
  - Turns out that he wants to sacrifice (his affection for) Hediyeh to increase his power.
- Razi: a *nif* of Eimin's mother's age who visits Medef two or three times a year.
  - He is one of Lady Kembe's "hands in the world" (does the practical things she can't).
  - Becomes Eimin's teacher, but we later discover that he is training Eimin to be part of the Other Hand.
  - Razi doesn't know how old he is or where he comes from (he suspects as a result of some old spell).

### More about Eimin

- Story arc: he comes to accept himself.
- An only child: his father left the family when he was a child.
  - Eimin blames himself, even though his mother has told him that she and his father just fell out of love.
- Wants Hediyeh and despises himself for it.
  - She's the alpha female in his age cohort, and wanting what he can't have is a way of punishing himself.
  - Recognizing this and outgrowing it is part of his story arc.
- Finds out he's being trained by Razi to join the Other Hand (*nif* who protect the Aphsi from outsiders).
  - The Aphsi can't kill because of their empathy.

## Minor Characters

- Jephel (male, teenager): placid *nif* a couple of years older than Eimin who is apprenticed to Medef's butcher.
  - Already accepts himself in a way that Eimin both despises and envies (foil for Eimin).
- Mureya (female, teenager): one of Hediyeh's circle who is in a budding relationship with Jephel.
  - Story arc: breaking free from Hediyeh.
- Grappa Uzman (male, elderly): brusque old Aphsi who keeps goats.
- Lady Kembe (female): magician in Ossisswe (mentioned but never encountered).

## Ideas

- Magicians must trade parts of themselves for power.
  - Eimin makes a bitter comment about getting nothing in exchange for being *nif*.
  - Razi replies that most people in the world don't either.
- The Pilots could trade parts of other people.
  - People have been trying to regain that power since their fall.
  - Foreshadows the big reveal in a later book: humans are magic fuel, and the Pilots' Disputation was about the morality of that.
- Medef has a waterstone.
  - Some villages in the Karaband rely on oases.
  - But there are a handful of waterstones that simply produce water endlessly (or teleport it from somewhere else - no-one knows).
  - The Aphsi can *drome* that there's a spirit of some sort in the waterstone powering it.
  - Someone tried to steal Qudef's waterstone several hundred years ago - it didn't go well for them.
- Suresh does stage magic as well as the real thing.
  - "I'm an entertainer."
  - Has the social ease that Eimin craves.
- Suresh lies to Eimin about magicians creating *nif* for the Other Hand.
  - Eimin's realization that his mother wouldn't do that to him is his character turning point.
  - As is his realization that Razi would…
- Suresh believes the waterstone will let him trade Hediyeh's life to gain power.
  - People can drome that Suresh is going to betray her, but they think that means he's going to move on.
  - Hediyeh is already practicing being forlorn with her girlfriends…
