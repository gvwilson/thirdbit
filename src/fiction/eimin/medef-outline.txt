Chapter 1:
Eimin, a Karabandi listener, describes his childhood in Medef,
where most people are Aphsi who can *drome* emotions.
He is *nif* (equivalent of deaf) and cannot,
which leaves him isolated and occasionally bullied by other Aphsi children,
particularly a girl his own age named Hediyeh.
A cruel prank brings him closer to Razi,
an older *nif* who reveals that he too was once bullied
and teaches Eimin that careful attention and planning can compensate for the lack of *droming*.
Their conversation ends with Razi offering to train Eimin.

Chapter 2:
Five years later, Eimin is Razi's apprentice,
and joins him on a hunt to for gargoyles who are pillaging Medef livestock.
Razi deliberately acts as bait,
giving Eimin a chance to kill one of the gargoyles.

Chapter 3:
Eimin and Razi return to Medef that evening.
Eimin contrasts Aphsi emotional awareness with his own feelings of social clumsiness.
His sleep is interrupted when news arrives that a caravan has been attacked near Medef
by bandits led by a Gifted (intelligent) lion.
Razi leads a small group to recover the caravan's livestock
while Eimin and two other *nif* stay behind,
driving off an abortive raid by the lion and her bandits.

Chapter 4:
The small caravan arrives in Medef.
As the villagers welcome it,
Eimin notices Hediyeh and one of the caravaneers exchange looks.
That caravaneer, Suresh, turns out to have a small printing press
and a stock of books, paper, and brushes.
He and Eimin strike up a conversation.
