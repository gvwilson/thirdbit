# Eimin

- *Eimin* is a YA fantasy novella about a teenage boy trying to find his place in the world.
  - 32,000 words / 20 chapters.
- Most people in Eimin's village (Medef) are Aphsi (empaths): they can *drome* the feelings of others.
  - But Eimin is *nif* (the equivalent of deaf), which makes him feel socially awkward.
    - Almost all *nif* are male.
  - Being *nif* is a metaphor for deafness, but also for being on the spectrum and feeling that you don't understand people.
  - The story should appeal to bookish kids who feel that they never quite fit in.
- The story is told in the first person from Eimin's point of view.
  - Occasional asides give the impression that he is actually telling the story to the reader.

## Major Characters

- Eimin (protagonist): male, 16, born and raised in Medef (more below).
- Hediyeh (antagonist): female, also 16, born and raised in Medef.
  - Enjoys other people's hurt the way some people enjoy the taste of ripe cheese.
  - Knows that Eimin has a crush on her, but dismisses him (both because he's *nif* and because she's mean).
- Suresh (antagonist): female, 20, a traveling magician with a love of books.
  - Initially friendly to both Eimin and Hediyeh, but alienates Eimin by growing closer to Hediyeh.
  - Turns out that she wants to sacrifice (her affection for) Hediyeh to increase her power.
- Razi: a *nif* of Eimin's mother's age who visits Medef two or three times a year.
  - He is one of Lady Kembe's "hands in the world" (does the practical things she can't).
  - Becomes Eimin's teacher, but we later discover that he is training Eimin to be part of the Other Hand.
  - Razi doesn't know how old he is or where he comes from (he suspects as a result of some old spell).

## More About the Setting

- Medef was a minor port on an inlet in Lake Karaband before the Disputation.
  - Lake Karaband became the Sea of Glass.
  - Ships, fish, etc. trapped in the glass, bits above the surface eroded away.
  - Glass itself is now cloudy, but here and there things can still be seen.
  - Cracks in the glass filled with windblown dirt and a few hardy plants.
- The Pilots' Palace (really just a small summer house).
  - Everything built to a larger-than-human scale.
  - Home to ghosts: nobody sleeps near it (or goes near it at all unless they're desperate or brave).
  - Voices tempting people insideâ€¦
- The ghost in Suresh's ring guides him to what he thinks is treasure.
  - Actually a human magician wanting to be released after being trapped for a thousand years.
- Magicians must trade parts of themselves for power.
  - Eimin makes a bitter comment about getting nothing in exchange for being *nif*.
  - Razi chides him: most people in the world don't either.
- The Pilots could trade parts of other people.
  - People have been trying to regain that power since their fall.
  - Foreshadows the big reveal in a later book: humans are magic fuel
    - The Pilots' Disputation was about the morality of that.
- Suresh does stage magic as well as the real thing.
  - "I'm an entertainer."
  - Has the social ease that Eimin craves.
- Gugun and Suresh were on a quest to change history.
  - The want to save Gugun's daughter (accidentally killed experimenting with the ring on Suresh's watch).
  - The ghost in the ring is lying about being able to do that.
- Suresh lies to Eimin about magicians creating *nif* for the Other Hand.
  - Eimin's realization that his mother wouldn't do that to him is his character turning point.
  - As is his realization that Razi would.
- People can drome that Suresh is going to betray Hediyeh, but they think that means she's going to move on.
  - Hediyeh enjoys practicing being forlorn.
- Kirash is a warning to Jephel.
