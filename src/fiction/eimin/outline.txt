# Eimin

- *Eimin* is a YA fantasy novella about a teenage boy trying to find his place in the world.
  - 32,000 words / 20 chapters.
- Most people in Eimin's village (Medef) are Aphsi (empaths): they can *drome* the feelings of others.
  - But Eimin is *nif* (the equivalent of deaf), which makes him feel socially awkward.
    - Almost all *nif* are male.
  - Being *nif* is a metaphor for deafness, but also for being on the spectrum and feeling that you don't understand people.
  - The story should appeal to bookish kids who feel that they never quite fit in.
- The story is told in the first person from Eimin's point of view.
  - Occasional asides give the impression that he is actually telling the story to the reader.

## Major Characters

- Eimin (protagonist): male, 16, born and raised in Medef (more below).
- Hediyeh (antagonist): female, also 16, born and raised in Medef.
  - Enjoys other people's hurt the way some people enjoy the taste of ripe cheese.
  - Knows that Eimin has a crush on her, but dismisses him (both because he's *nif* and because she's mean).
- Suresh (antagonist): male, 20, a traveling magician disguised as a printer and bookseller.
  - Initially friendly to both Eimin and Hediyeh, but alienates Eimin by growing closer to Hediyeh.
  - Turns out that he wants to sacrifice Hediyeh to increase his power.
- Razi: a *nif* of Eimin's mother's age who visits Medef two or three times a year.
  - He is one of Lady Kembe's "hands in the world" (does the practical things she can't).
  - Becomes Eimin's teacher, but we later discover that he is training Eimin to be part of the Other Hand.
  - Razi doesn't know how old he is or where he comes from (he suspects as a result of some old spell).

### More about Eimin

  - Eimin blames himself, even though his mother has told him that she and his father just fell out of love.

## More About the Setting

- Medef was a minor port on an inlet in Lake Karaband before the Disputation.

  - Glass itself is now cloudy, but here and there things can still be seen.
  - Cracks in the glass filled with windblown dirt and a few hardy plants.
- The Pilots' Palace (really just a small summer house).
  - Everything built to a larger-than-human scale.
  - Home to ghosts: nobody sleeps near it (or goes near it at all unless they're desperate or brave).
  - Voices tempting people inside…
- The ghost in Suresh's ring guides him to what he thinks is treasure.
  - Actually a human magician wanting to be released after being trapped for a thousand years.
- Magicians must trade parts of themselves for power.
  - Eimin makes a bitter comment about getting nothing in exchange for being *nif*.
  - Razi chides him: most people in the world don't either.
- The Pilots could trade parts of other people.
  - People have been trying to regain that power since their fall.
  - Foreshadows the big reveal in a later book: humans are magic fuel
    - The Pilots' Disputation was about the morality of that.
- Suresh does stage magic as well as the real thing.
  - "I'm an entertainer."
  - Has the social ease that Eimin craves.
- Suresh wants to change the past
  - The ghost in the ring is lying about being able to do that.
- Suresh lies to Eimin about magicians creating *nif* for the Other Hand.
  - Eimin's realization that his mother wouldn't do that to him is his character turning point.
  - As is his realization that Razi would.
- People can drome that Suresh is going to betray Hediyeh, but they think that means she's going to move on.
  - Hediyeh enjoys practicing being forlorn.
- Kirash is a warning to Jephel.

## Outline

### Chapter 1

Eimin, a Karabandi listener, describes his childhood in Medef,
where most people are Aphsi who can *drome* emotions.
He is *nif* (equivalent of deaf) and cannot,
which leaves him isolated and occasionally bullied by other Aphsi children,
particularly a girl his own age named Hediyeh.
A cruel prank brings him closer to Razi,
an older *nif* who reveals that he too was once bullied
and teaches Eimin that careful attention and planning can compensate for the lack of *droming*.
Their conversation ends with Razi offering to train Eimin.

### Chapter 2

Five years later, Eimin is Razi's apprentice,
and joins him on a hunt to for gargoyles who are pillaging Medef livestock.
Razi deliberately acts as bait,
giving Eimin a chance to kill one of the gargoyles.

### Chapter 3

Eimin and Razi return to Medef that evening.
Eimin contrasts Aphsi emotional awareness with his own feelings of social clumsiness.
His sleep is interrupted when news arrives that a caravan has been attacked near Medef
by bandits led by a Gifted (intelligent) lion.
Razi leads a small group to recover the caravan's livestock
while Eimin and two other *nif* stay behind,
driving off an abortive raid by the lion and her bandits.

### Chapter 4

The small caravan arrives in Medef.
As the villagers welcome it,
Eimin notices Hediyeh and one of the caravaneers exchange looks.
That caravaneer, Suresh, turns out to have a small printing press
and a stock of books, paper, and brushes.
He and Eimin strike up a conversation.
