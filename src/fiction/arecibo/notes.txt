This is an extremely well written, intriguing and original story which is epic in its scope, grasping momentous moments in Earth’s history and its potential future, with its grasp always on the people’s suffering and the stars. But the middle section of the story is too repetitive and the reader is kept in the dark for too long. The story needs to be cut in the second section of the first half and the first section of the second half in order to maintain momentum and reader interest. I think it would also benefit from more foreshadowing.

The writing is powerful, the world detailed, rich, and interesting. I thought the beginning was very strong, but the middle felt too long (or perhaps not as much change in world as needed).
