  I'm very excited that Massuni's Kickstarter has launched.
  They're bringing custom furniture design to the web:
  you can use an in-browser tool to design exactly what you need,
  and they then manufacture it using a mass customization process.
  I know I'm biased–its founder is a family member–but
  this is what the word "revolutionary" is meant to be used for.
