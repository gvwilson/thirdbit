  Blake Winton pointed me at <a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2014/09/05/the-beauty-of-code/">this article</a>
  by Vikram Chandra in the <a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/">Paris Review</a>
  titled "The Beauty of Code".
  It opens with a hairball of a dependency diagram,
  then quotes from Yukihiro Matsumoto's essay in
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Code-Leading-Programmers-Practice/dp/0596510047/"><em>Beautiful Code</em></a>
  (but doesn't link to it).
  Chandra's own book
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Geek-Sublime-The-Beauty-Code/dp/1555976859/"><em>Geek Sublime</em></a>
  has mixed reviews on Amazon,
  but is now on my reading listâ€¦
