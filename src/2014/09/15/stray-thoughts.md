  My friend Bob told me a story once.
  He spent a winter in a cabin outside Whitehorse with only a dog for company.
  When the thaw finally came,
  he and his dog got into his truck and headed into town to pick up supplies.
  Suddenly,
  without warning,
  a thought popped into his head:
  "I wonder if I have enough money?"
  He said it didn't feel like it was <em>his</em> thought.
  It felt like it was something from outside him
  that had just been floating around looking for a brain to land in,
  in the way that a mosquito might cruise around looking for a patch of skin and a full vein.

  I felt that way yesterday.
  We went up north on Friday,
  and spent the weekend eating, sleeping, reading,
  sleeping some more,
  helping my father-in-law with chores,
  and listening to Maddie and her friend play make-believe
  and go, "Wow," as marshmallows turned black, swelled up, and burst.
  (They burned a lot more than they ate.)
  The car broken down on the way home,
  so what would usually be a three and a half hour journey was closer to six,
  but it wasn't until we came over the hill and saw the tops of Toronto's skyscrapers that I thought,
  "I have to finish writing that summary.  And archive everything from the code review study.  Andâ€¦"

  They really didn't feel like my thoughts.
