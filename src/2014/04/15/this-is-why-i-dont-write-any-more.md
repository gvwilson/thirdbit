  Sunday: help <a href="http://mikedebo.ca/">Michael DiBernardo</a>
  run a reviewing sprint on <em><a href="https://github.com/aosabook/500lines">500 Lines or Less</a></em>,
  the fourth volume in <em><a href="http://aosabook.org/en/index.html">The Architecture of Open Source Applications</a></em>,
  then forget to mention him by name in a lightning talk about the project.
  (Sorry, manâ€¦)
</p>
<p>
  Monday: teach <a href="http://lukasblakk.com/learn-to-teach-programming/">a one-day version</a>
  of <a href="http://teaching.software-carpentry.org">our instructor training course</a>
  while a dozen other people are teaching three Software Carpentry bootcamps in parallel
  and a bunch of volunteers are sprinting to
  <a href="http://github.com/scrapinghub/pycon-speakers/">gather names and genders of speakers at computing conferences</a>
  so that we can track changes in gender balance over time for each.
</p>
<p>
  Tuesday: catch up on email during the second day of bootcamps
  while other volunteers are hacking on
  <a href="http://github.com/macewanCMPT395/aspidites/">the turtle graphics library</a>
  for the <a href="http://ipython.org/">IPython Notebook</a>
  that <a href="http://academic.macewan.ca/macdonellc4/">Cam Macdonell</a>'s students
  built at <a href="http://www.macewan.ca/">MacEwan University</a> this term.
  As I'm doing that,
  I get mail from a prof at <a href="http://www.concordia.ca/">Concordia University</a>
  asking me what I think of the work <a href="http://tavisharmstrong.com/">Tavish Armstrong</a> and his friends did
  on <a href="http://nbdiff.org/">NBDiff</a>,
  and another message telling me that our bootcamp in California
  for women in science and engineering
  has been a smash hit.
