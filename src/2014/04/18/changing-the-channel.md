<p>
  A lot of open source projects use an antiquated-but-reliable chat system
  called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a>
  for long-running conversations.
  We've had an IRC channel for Software Carpentry
  for a while,
  but it's never had very much traffic.
  It also hasn't done anything to help people get involved in the open science community at large.
  We are therefore retiring it,
  and encouraging people–all kinds of people,
  not just instructors and bootcamp alumni–to join us
  on the Mozilla Science Lab IRC channel instead.
  We hope this will become a place where people can swap tips on teaching programming to scientists,
  discuss new forms of publication,
  seek help on specific research problems,
  and everything in between.
