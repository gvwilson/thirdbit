  Last week's post about our original logo
  reminded me that I'd never blogged about one of the books that inspired Software Carpentry in the first place:
  Rubin Landau and Paul Fink's
  <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Scientists-Engineers-Guide-Workstations-Supercomputers/dp/0471532711/">A Scientist's and Engineer's Guide to Workstations and Supercomputers: Coping with Unix, RISC, Vectors, and Programming</a></em>.
  You'd have add a few zeroes to the speeds, bandwidths, and data sizes they discuss
  to bring it up to date,
  but other than that,
  it's held up surprisingly (or depressingly) well.
