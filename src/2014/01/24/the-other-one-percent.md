title: "The Other One Per Cent"

  Over the past year,
  there's been a minor rage storm on the internet
  (and oh yeah, in print, I guess)
  about the widening gulf between academic haves and have-nots.
  One theme that's come up over and over again is
  the unexamined privilege of the tenured few who run academia
  (see for example
  <a href="http://pankisseskafka.com/2013/12/20/naming-and-shaming-uc-riverside-english-gives-candidates-3-days-notice/">this post</a>,
  and more importantly <a href="http://pankisseskafka.com/2013/12/23/a-radical-defense-of-the-status-quo/">this follow-up</a>).
</p>
<p>
  I'm on the side of the ragers,
  but I think many of them don't realize that
  they're part of a different "one per cent" when it comes to information.
  I no longer have an academic position,
  so I can't (legally) access a lot of the research literature on cancer,
  dementia,
  heart disease,
  or less important topics like how to teach programming.
  What I <em>can</em> get costs me more:
  more time searching,
  more sweat cross-referencing things because I'm shut out of systems that could do it with a single click,
  and so on.
  It's a less important axis of inequality than income and power,
  but it directly affects many more people,
  and if the first is unjust,
  then so is the second.
