  This is pretty amazing:
  a group has translated the core Software Carpentry lessons into Korean.
  It's a remarkable and encouraging achievementâ€“congratulations and thanks
  to the team that did the work:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Victor KC Lee (&#51060;&#44305;&#52632;): Translation Lead</li>
  <li>Jungsu Han (&#54620;&#51221;&#49688;): Translator</li>
  <li>Chungyeong Moon (&#47928;&#52632;&#44221;): Illustrator</li>
  <li>Ri Jeong Kim (&#44608;&#51060;&#51221;): Graphic Designer</li>
  <li>Hwan Beom Kang (&#44053;&#54872;&#48276;): Support</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We still need to figure out how to manage this:
  Gabriel Devenyi's post outlined our options,
  but someone will need to take the lead to set something up
  so that versions in various languages can stay in sync.
