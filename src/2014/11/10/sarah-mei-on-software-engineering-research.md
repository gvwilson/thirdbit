  Sarah Mei tweeted this
  in response to news that researchers at Rice were getting $11 million
  for a souped-up autocomplete:
</p>
<blockquote>
  These Rice University folks do realize that "coding" is about 5% of what software developers do. Right?

<blockquote>
  Hope they can optimize the shit out of that 5% with their 11 MILLION
  dollars. That is surely a good use of my taxes.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  Academic research on software engineering has been a decade behind
  current practice since I've been practicing. Some contributing
  factors:
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  1) The folks with PhDs often haven't been practitioners for years
  (if ever). They don't know what state of the art looks like.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  2) They often study students, so their results seem curiously
  divorced from the practices of a typical team with a mix of
  experience levels.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  3) When they don't study students, they study large companies. Large
  companies are typically a decade behind the leading edge on process.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  4) The researchers lack the network to study small companies, and
  small companies themselves are often less interested in being
  studied.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  5) Many researchers don't think startups are worth studying. They're
  "not doing real engineering," or "too small-scale to be
  interesting."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
   I don't know how to fix this. Some parts of computer science are
   way out ahead of practice, and I wish this were one of them.
