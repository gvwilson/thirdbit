A few days ago,
we were asked what was the greatest number of simultaneous workshops we'd ever run.
I didn't know,
but it was an easy enough question to answer from our records:

![Simultaneous workshops over time](@root/files/2016/02/active-workshops.png "Simultaneous workshops over time")

I'm sure better visualizations are possible
(if you want to create one, the raw data is [here](@root/files/2016/02/active-workshops.csv)),
and we should find some way to show that
the burst starting in April 2014 is actually a couple of workshops that were spread out over several weeks,
but I think the trend line is pretty cool.
