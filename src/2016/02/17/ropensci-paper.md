Carl Boettiger,
Scott Chamberlain,
Ted Hart,
and Karthik Ram
have just published a paper titled
"[Building Software, Building Community: Lessons from the rOpenSci Project](http://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/jors.bu/)",
in which they describe what they've learned by growing the [rOpenSci](http://ropensci.org/) project
There are a lot of great ideas here that other groups could borrow,
and of course you can keep up with their news by
[following their blog](http://ropensci.org/blog/).
