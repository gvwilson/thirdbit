  I've been wondering for years why people don't collaborate on lessons
  in the same open, ad hoc way they write Wikipedia and build open source software.
  Turns out I may have been using the wrong analogy.
  <a href="https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/">Teachers Pay Teachers</a> is
  "â€¦ the first and largest open marketplace where teachers share, sell, and buy original educational resources",
  i.e., it's Etsy for teaching rather than Wikipedia.
  Their site says they have earned $200 million for their teacher-authors since their founding,
  and have two million "resources" available,
  ranging from lesson plans and interactive notebooks to games and classroom decor.
