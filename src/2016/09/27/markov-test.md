The [Turing Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) is used to determine
whether a program exhibits human behavior.
I'd like to propose that we use a *Markov Test* to determine
whether a human being exhibits *interesting* behavior:

1.  Train a [Markov chain text generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Markov_text_generators)
    on a sufficiently large corpus of the person's speech and writing.

2.  Put samples of the person's actual utterances
    and equal-sized samples of the generator's output
    in front of a human judge.

3.  If the human being can't tell the difference between the two,
    classify the person as "uninteresting".

I'm pretty sure that [some prominent people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump)
would fail to pass this testâ€¦
