Following Erin Becker's analysis of our instructor training data,
Byron Smith has done another analysis
using survival statistics.
The three key figures are:

<img alt="Survival curve of days to teaching a second time after having taught once" src="http://blog.byronjsmith.com/static/images/swc-survival-taught-second-curve.png" class="centered">

Long story short,
about half of instructors teach within 200 days of certifying,
and about half of those teach again with 100 days.
If anyone has similar stats from other volunteer teaching organizations,
we'd be grateful for pointers.
