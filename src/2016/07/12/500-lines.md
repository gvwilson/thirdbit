  After a lot of hard work by Mike Dibernardo and Amy Brown,
  the latest book in the <a href="http://aosabook.org">AOSA Series</a> is now out.
  It's called
  <em><a href="http://aosabook.org/blog/2016/07/500-lines-or-less-is-available-now/">500 Lines or Less</a></em>,
  and in it,
  developers walk readers through small but realistic implementations of databases, web servers, game engines,
  and many other kinds of applications.
  I think it's wonderfulâ€“congratulations to Amy, Mike, and all the contributors.
