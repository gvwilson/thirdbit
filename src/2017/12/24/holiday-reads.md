- *[Three Parts Dead](https://www.amazon.com/Three-Parts-Dead-Craft-Sequence/dp/0765333112/)*
  and the rest of Max Gladstone's Craft Sequence.
- *[Retribution Falls](https://www.amazon.com/Retribution-Falls-Chris-Wooding/dp/0345522516/)*
  and the other three volumes of Chris Wooding's *Tales of the Ketty Jay*.
- N. K. Jemisin's *Broken Earth* trilogy,
  (which starts with *[The Fifth Season](https://www.amazon.com/Fifth-Season-Broken-Earth/dp/0316229296/)*
  and just keeps getting better)
  deserved all the praise it got.
- Peter Higgins' *[Wolfhound Century](https://www.amazon.com/Wolfhound-Century-Peter-Higgins/dp/031621969X/)* trilogy
  didn't get nearly the attention it deserved.
- V. E. Schwab's *[A Darker Shade of Magic](https://www.amazon.com/Darker-Shade-Magic-Novel-Shades/dp/0765376466/)*
  is the beginning of another great trilogy.
- Paolo Bacigalupi's *[The Windup Girl](https://www.amazon.com/Windup-Girl-Paolo-Bacigalupi/dp/1597808210/)*
  is one of the few hard SF books I've enjoyed in recent years.
- *[The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August](https://www.amazon.com/First-Fifteen-Lives-Harry-August/dp/0316399620/)*,
  *[The Sudden Appearance of Hope](https://www.amazon.com/Sudden-Appearance-Hope-Claire-North/dp/0316335967/)*,
  and above all, *[The End of the Day](https://www.amazon.com/End-Day-Claire-North/dp/031631675X/)*,
  all by Claire North.
- Colson Whitehead's *[Zone One](https://www.amazon.com/Zone-One-Colson-Whitehead/dp/0307455173/)*
  and M. R. Carey's *[The Girl With All the Gifts](https://www.amazon.com/Girl-All-Gifts-M-Carey/dp/0316334758/)*.
  (Who says you can't make art with zombies?)
- Philip Reeve's *[Mortal Engines](https://www.amazon.com/Mortal-Engines-1/dp/1338201123/)*, its three sequels,
  *and* the prequel trilogy were all excellent.
- Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff's *[Illuminae](https://www.amazon.com/Illuminae-Files-Amie-Kaufman/dp/0553499149/)*
  and *[Gemina](https://www.amazon.com/Gemina-Illuminae-Files-Amie-Kaufman/dp/0553499181/)*
  are wonderfully inventive.
  (The concluding volume of the trilogy is out this spring.)
- Marie Brennan's *[A Natural History of Dragons](https://www.amazon.com/Natural-History-Dragons-Memoir-Memoirs/dp/0765375079/)*
  is the start of a five-novel arc that comes to a perfect conclusion.
- Laini Taylor's *[Daughter of Smoke and Bone](https://www.amazon.com/Daughter-Smoke-Bone/dp/031613399X/)* trilogy
  had a great arc as well.
- Matt Ruff's *[The Mirage](https://www.amazon.com/Mirage-Novel-Matt-Ruff/dp/0061976237/)* was brilliant.
- G. Willow Wilson's *[Alif the Unseen](https://www.amazon.com/Alif-Unseen-G-Willow-Wilson/dp/0802121225/)*
  still has me thinkingâ€¦
- Michael Chabon's *[The Yiddish Policeman's Union](https://www.amazon.com/Yiddish-Policemens-Union-Novel-P-S/dp/0007149832/)*
  might be literature, but it's OK despite that.
- I filed Ben H. Winters' *[The Last Policeman](https://www.amazon.com/Last-Policeman-Novel-Trilogy/dp/1594746745/)*
  under "sad but necessary".
- Daryl Gregory's *[We Are All Completely Fine](https://www.amazon.com/We-Are-All-Completely-Fine/dp/1616961716/)*
  goes under "scary and subversively funny".
- Scott Hawkins' *[The Library at Mount Char](https://www.amazon.com/Library-at-Mount-Char/dp/0553418629/)*
  isn't an easy read, but it's a good one.
- Robert Jackson Bennett's *[City of Stairs](https://www.amazon.com/Stairs-Divine-Cities-Jackson-Bennett/dp/080413717X/)*
  and its two sequels are exciting and satisfying in equal measure.
- Seth Dickinson's *[The Traitor Baru Cormorant](https://www.amazon.com/Traitor-Baru-Cormorant-Masquerade/dp/0765380730/)*
  makes *The Count of Monte Cristo* look like a whiny child.
- *[The Mechanical](https://www.amazon.com/Mechanical-Alchemy-Wars-Ian-Tregillis/dp/0316248002/)* starts one of
  Ian Tregillis's enjoyable trilogies,
  and *[Bitter Seeds](https://www.amazon.com/Bitter-Seeds-Ian-Tregillis/dp/0765321505/)* another.
- No trilogies for Daniel Abraham: *[The Dragon's Path](https://www.amazon.com/Dragons-Path-Dagger-Coin/dp/0316080683/)*
  is the first of a perfectly executed five-book series.
- And if we're talking about "perfectly executed",
  Lois McMaster Bujold's *[The Curse of Chalion](https://www.amazon.com/Curse-Chalion-Lois-McMaster-Bujold/dp/0061134244/)*
  has to be front and center.
