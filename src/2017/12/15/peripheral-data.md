title: "What Does Peripheral Participation in Data Look Like?"

One of the cornerstones of modern learning theory is [legitimate peripheral participation][lpp]:
the idea that newcomers become members of a community of practice
by participating in low-risk/low-effort tasks
that are genuinely useful the community
while giving the newcomers a chance to learn vocabulary,
meet people,
and internalize the community's unwritten rules.
Driving people to polling booths on election day is an example:
it's important,
but it doesn't require a lot of training or a long-term commitment to the party.

During a conversation with [Dan Sholler][sholler] yesterday,
we realized that there's an important difference between open source software development
and open data.
A lot of open source projects have internalized the idea of legitimate peripheral participation,
and work hard to ensure that [newcomers can get set up easily and find entry-level tasks to work on][steinmacher].
(The [OpenHatch][openhatch] project did a wonderful job of matching newcomers to projects;
it's a real shame it has [wound down][openhatch-end].)

Our realization was that there isn't something like this for open dataâ€“at least,
not for graduate students and other "serious" scientists.
As a layperson,
I can contribute to any number of citizen science projects by counting birds,
sampling my local water supply,
or identifying galaxies on my cellphone.
But what's the next step?
If I'm a graduate student,
I can upload the data I've collected to one of many different sites for other people to use,
but that's like saying that as a programmer,
I can write a brand new package for Python.
Most open source contributors hone their skills by contributing patches to existing projects first;
what's the equivalent of small, incremental contributions to a community dataset
for people who are training to be full-time scientists,
but are still on the periphery of their community?
