title: "Wanted: A Workable Lesson Competition"

I have sometimes quipped that we'll know our work is done
when the weekend papers run lesson reviews beside their book and movie reviews.
(Yes, I quip. I can in fact be extremely quippy, but that's a digression.)
But reviews aren't the only sign I'm waiting for,
and neither is [collaborative lesson development](@root/2016/04/29/why-teachers-dont-collaborate/).
I also hope I live long enough to see competitions like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions)'s
in which people or teams vie with each other to build the best possible lessons
about particular topics and for particular audiences.

The best model I know for this would the competitions Ned Gulley used to run at the MathWorks.
As he described in [this paper](https://ramblesblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/inpraiseoftweaking.pdf),
everything is done in the open:
the winner isn't the person who submits the top-performing entry,
but the person who contributed most to the overall result.
I think this mix of openness and competitiveness would be wonderful for lesson construction…

…except I have no idea how to grade submissions.
Grading code is easy:
does it run,
and if so,
is it faster or more accurate than something else?
But there's no way to robo-grade the effectiveness of a lesson,
and relying on a panel of human experts would neither scale
nor provide sufficiently timely feedback.

All of which brings me back to Mike Caulfield's [choral explanations](https://hapgood.us/2016/05/13/choral-explanations/),
and the idea that our notion of "lesson" may be obsolete.
At their best,
Stack Overflow and Quora provide a (loosely) curated chorus of answers to each question;
those answers aren't connected to form a narrative by something like Storify or [DebateGraph](https://debategraph.org/),
but they could be.
Would it be possible to award points for adding those narrative links,
and using the frequency with which people traverse them as a measure of efficacy?
Or is the very notion of automating assessment of lesson efficacy yet another category error on my part.
