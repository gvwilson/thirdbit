Today is November 11th.
Every year,
on this day,
we pause for a moment to remember those who fought so that we don't have to.
Every year,
on this day,
we take a moment to remember those who gave what was asked,
when it was asked,
so that we could say what we want,
love who we want,
vote how we want,
and be who we want
without worrying about a boot at the door in the middle of the night
and what comes after.
They were not always good,
and their cause was not always just,
but our world would be a worse place without their sacrifice.
