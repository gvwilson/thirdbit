Tomorrow is the second anniversary of my father's death.
I cannot know what he would say about the state of the world today,
but I rather suspect he would quote William Blake:

<blockquote>
When I tell the truth,
it is not for the sake of convincing those who do not know it,
<br>
but for the sake of defending those that do.
</blockquote>

I miss you, Dad.
