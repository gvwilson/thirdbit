  Millions for compilers but hardly a penny for understanding human
  programming language use. Now, programming languages are obviously
  symmetrical, the computer on one side, the programmer on the
  other. In an appropriate science of computer languages, one would
  expect that half the effort would be on the computer side,
  understanding how to translate the languages into executable form,
  and half on the human side, understanding how to design languages
  that are easy or productive to use…. The human and computer parts
  of programming languages have developed in radical asymmetry.
