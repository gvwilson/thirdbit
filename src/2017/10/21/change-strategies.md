<p>
  I read Borrego and Henderson's paper on getting people and institutions to adopt better teaching techniques
  for the third time this week,
  and once again came away with new ideas about what I've been doing
  and what might work better.
  The heart of the paper is this table,
  which presents a framework for thinking about how to get teachers and institutions to actually make changes.
  (My apologies for the crappy formatting:
  trying to rotate text 90 degrees with HTML and CSS is enough to drive me back to Microsoft Word.)

  The bulk of the paper expands each of the bulleted strategies;
  there's lots here to chew on,
  and I'd welcome other readers' thoughts.

    "Increasing the Use of Evidence-Based Teaching in STEM Higher Education: A Comparison of Eight Change Strategies."
    <em>Journal of Engineering Education</em>,
    103(2),
    April 2014,
    10.1002/jee.20040.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Background</strong> Prior efforts have built a knowledge
    base of effective undergraduate STEM pedagogies, yet rates of
    implementation remain low. Theories from higher education,
    management, communication, and other fields can inform change
    efforts but remain largely inaccessible to STEM education leaders,
    who are just beginning to view change as a scholarly endeavor
    informed by the research literature.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Purpose</strong> This article describes the goals,
    assumptions, and underlying logic of selected change strategies
    with potential relevance to STEM higher education settings for a
    target audience of change agents, leaders, and researchers.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Scope/Method</strong> This review is organized according
    to the Four Categories of Change Strategies model developed by
    Henderson, Beach, and Finkelstein (2011). We describe eight
    strategies of potential practical relevance to STEM education
    change efforts (two from each category). For each change strategy,
    we present a summary with key references, discuss their
    applicability to STEM higher education, provide a STEM education
    example, and discuss implications for change efforts and research.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Conclusions</strong> Change agents are guided, often
    implicitly, by a single change strategy. These eight strategies
    will expand the repertoire of change agents by helping them
    consider change from a greater diversity of perspectives. Change
    agents can use these descriptions to design more robust change
    efforts. Improvements in the knowledge and theory base underlying
    change strategies will occur when change agents situate their
    writing about change initiatives using shared models, such as the
    one presented in this article, to make their underlying
    assumptions about change more explicit.
