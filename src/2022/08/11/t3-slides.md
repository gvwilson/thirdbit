I have posted [slides for a one-day workshop](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LVcmp48Ym0c6pA9GOT6TrCa47RU1ugaV)
based on [*Teaching Tech Together*](https://teachtogether.tech/).
Some material was originally created for
[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org)' instructor training
and RStudio's instructor certification program;
all can be re-used and recycled under
[the Creative Commons - Attribution license](@root/license/).
Corrections and improvements are always welcome,
but please keep in mind that this material already makes for a long day:
if you wish to add anything,
please try to identify something that can be taken out to make room.
