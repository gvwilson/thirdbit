title: "First Copy"

It's been an off and on project since 2018
(with a lot more "off" than "on"),
but the JavaScript version of *Software Design by Example* is finally here.
You can read the whole thing online at <https://third-bit.com/sdxjs/>,
but if you buy a copy,
all the royalties go to the [Red Door Family Shelter](https://www.reddoorshelter.ca/) in Toronto.
Even if you don't want hard copy,
please consider a donation:
the last couple of years have been very hard on the people they're trying to help.
