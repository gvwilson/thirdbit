Years ago,
after I screwed up something important,
I defended myself by saying,
"I'm doing the best I can."
My brother replied,
"Then try to do the best of someone better."
When I said,
"Ouch," he said,
"Because if you try and keep trying maybe you'll _become_ someone better."

So happy birthday, [Jeff](@root/2018/03/20/goodbye-jeff/) - I'm still trying.
