Suppose you have a grid that's W squares wide and H squares tall.
How many different ways can you cover it with rectangular tiles?
It's easy enough to work out the answer for specific cases:

| Grid Size | Number of Tilings |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| 1x1       | 1                 |
| 1x2       | 2                 |
| 2x2       | 8                 |

but I can't figure out the formula for the general caseâ€”a simple recursive formula
double-counts configurations like the four size-one squares in the diagram below.

*Later: several people have suggested divide-and-conquer strategies,
but so far I haven't seen one that would generate this case,
where there isn't a seam spanning either the entire height or width:*

*Later still: [my brother](@root/2018/03/20/goodbye-jeff/)
asked me the question 20 years ago when he was starting a furniture-making company.
Yetserday,
[Julian Berman](https://github.com/Julian) got an answer from Bhavik Mehta at Cambridge:
it turns out an undergrad in Louisiana named Joshua Smith,
who was working with [Helena Verrill](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/helena_verrill/),
solved this in 2005 or 2006.
Their work is online at <https://oeis.org/A116694> and <https://oeis.org/A116694/a116694.pdf>,
so,
um,
yay Internet,
and thank you Helena, Joshua, Bhavik, and Julian.
