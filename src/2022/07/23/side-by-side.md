We finally said [goodbye to my mum](@root/2020/01/07/goodbye-mum/) yesterday.
She's buried beside [my dad](@root/2015/09/22/dad/)
and [my sister](@root/2012/01/21/the-life-i-did-live-the-breath-i-breathed/)
in a grassy little field near where I still,
forty years on,
think of as "home".

The trip was supposed to be our first real family holiday in two years,
but Sadie and I came down with COVID on our second day,
so we spent almost all of it holed up in hotel rooms coughing and sleeping.
It's not how I wanted to say goodbye,
but I'm glad they're all together.

Comes your last day, and then another
