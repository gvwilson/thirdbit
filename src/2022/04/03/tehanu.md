When I die, I shall breathe back the breath that made me live.
I shall give back to the world all that I didn't do.
All that I might have been and wasn't.
All the choices I didn't make.
All the things I lost and spent and wasted.
I shall give them back to the world.
To the lives that haven't been lived yet.
That will be my gift back to the world that gave me the life I did live,
the life I loved,
the breath I breathed.

â€” Ursula Le Guin, *Tehanu*
