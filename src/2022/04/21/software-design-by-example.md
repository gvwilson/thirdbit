title: "Software Design by Example"

I have moved my book-in-progress on software design from https://stjs.tech/
to a new home on this site at <https://third-bit.com/sdxjs/>:
the old site's name no longer matched the book's title
(which has changed from *Software Tools in JavaScript* to *Software Design by Example*),
and I am trying to cut back on the number of small domains I manage.
The source remains available at <https://github.com/software-tools-books/stjs/>;
if all goes to plan,
Taylor & Francis will publish it by the end of this year.
