I used to play a little jazz, and was fond of a Gershwin tune called "But Not For Me":
<blockquote><font class="txt_1">  They're writing songs of love, but not for me,
A lucky star's above, but not for me</font></blockquote>
The lyrics came to mind when I saw <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/22481.wss">this announcement</a> from IBM about a new Jazz Faculty Grants program, which is giving faculty at UC Irvine, UBC, and the University of Victoria funding to study ways of "…exploring the promise of global collaborative software development that taps into the skills and expertise of developers regardless of location."  That's a pretty good description of what I'd like to do with DrProject; unfortunately, IBM's money is tied to its Rational-based products (which I believe are too heavyweight for undergrad education).  Oh well…
