Citizen Lab's recently completed Internet censorship circumvention guide intended for non-technical users, called <strong>Everyone's Guide to By-Passing Internet Censorship for Citizens Worldwide</strong>. There is a companion guide yet to come on how to publish information online targeted for censorship, and we are presently working on having this guide translated into multiple languages. Feedback most welcome.
