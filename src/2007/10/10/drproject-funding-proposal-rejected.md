title: "DrProject Funding Proposal Rejected"

I received a letter today from NSERC telling me that the "Idea to Innovation" proposal for DrProject has been rejected:
<blockquote>The Selection Committee considered that the research component of the application is limited as it is essentially an engineering project, which integrates existing technologies within an existing framework. The project was considered more suitable for an existing company that already has a market presence.
</blockquote>
Of the four reviews included, two were positive, one equivocal, and one strongly against, and very critical of the way the proposal was presented. I'm very disappointed, particularly since I thought this kind of thing was exactly what I2I was <em>for</em>, but I'll push ahead and try to secure funding through other channels.
