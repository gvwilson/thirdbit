It's a small world: Andy Oram, my co-editor on <a href="http://beautifulcode.oreillynet.com/"><em>Beautiful Code</em></a>, just <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/10/supercomputing.html">interviewed</a> Brent Gorda, co-author of the first version of the Software Carpentry course, about the cluster challenge that's running at Supercomputing'07. Don't be fooled by the purple-on-black titles: this is a very cool idea.  Students teams get fixed time (and fixed electrical power) to put together a cluster and run some benchmarks.  Doing this earned you a PhD twenty years ago; ten years ago, it would have been a line item in a department's budget.  It's now a contest for students, and I look forward to finding a cluster in the bottom of a cereal box before I dieâ€¦ ;-)

<em>Later: Brent has started <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2007/11/sc07_cluster_challenge_introdu.html">blogging</a> about the Cluster Challenge at O'Reilly's ONLamp site. I'm looking forward to hearing how the teams do.</em>
