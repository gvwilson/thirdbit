Now <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/patent/patentpress_013107.htm">this</a> is an interesting development: <a href="http://www.blackboard.com">Blackboard</a>, the 800-pound gorilla of learning management systems, has made a legally-binding pledge not to enforce any of their software patents against open source or home-grown systems.  It's partly defensive—lots of people were unhappy with the scope of their patents—but it's also an enlightened compromise that I believe is being made in good faith.  It'd be nice to see a few other big companies follow suit…
