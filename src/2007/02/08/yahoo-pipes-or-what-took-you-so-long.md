Big splash today about <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/02/yahoo_pipes_the.html">Yahoo Pipes</a>, complete with <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/02/pipes_and_filte.html">launch puff from Tim O'Reilly</a>.  On the one hand, past generations of WYSIWYG flowgraph programming tools have run into "can't quite reach it" problems pretty quickly.  On the other, this is just… plain… cool.  Wonder how long it'll be before someone connects it with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell">Windows PowerShell</a>?
