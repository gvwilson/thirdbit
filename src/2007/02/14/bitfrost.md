Via <a href="http://www.schneier.com">Bruce Schneier</a> comes <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Bitfrost">BitFrost</a>, a radically different take on computer security being developed for the <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org">One Laptop Per Child</a> project.  I have serious reservatios about OLPC—is internet connectivity <em>really</em> more deserving of money than clean water or immunization?—but its emphasis on reliability and usability could upset a lot of first-world apple carts.  If you're young, idealistic, and ambitious, there aren't many better projects to get involved in right now…
