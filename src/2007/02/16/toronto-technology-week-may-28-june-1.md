Toronto Technology Week is a new initiative to showcase just how much innovation is happening 'round here.  Their announcement is below, minus the dozens of mis-matched font tags put into the origina by at least two different versions of Word.

These will include seminars and business networking functions, job fairs, collaboration demonstrations, an ICT business open-door program, school projects, educational seminars, special exhibits showcasing innovation and excellence and more.
