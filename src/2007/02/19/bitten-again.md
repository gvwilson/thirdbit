I'm helping to edit a book for <a href="http://www.oreilly.com">O'Reilly</a>, and we're keeping details on contributors, and the status of their chapters, in a little <a href="http://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a> database.  The database file is kept under version control, since everything should be; unfortunately, <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> doesn't know how to diff or merge concurrent changes.  I've griped about this before: just as languages become more useful when functions and classes are first-class values, so too do data formats become more usable when they are supported by tools that let people create them collaboratively.  Moving the data itself onto the web (as I suggested to scientists who are using Excel spreadsheets as structured lab notebooks) is a stopgap measure: the real world will <em>always</em> require people to work offline from time to time, and we damn well ought to support it.
