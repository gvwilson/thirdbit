Interesting <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/04/the_patriarchy_.html">post</a> at Marginal Revolution (a site I hadn't seen before, and about which I know nothing) reporting on a <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=944179">study</a> reporting that the gender gap among tenured professors can be entirely explained by fertility decisions.  What makes the Marginal Revolution <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/04/the_patriarchy_.html">post</a> really interesting is the comments, which claim that the Survey of Doctorate Recipients data the study is based on is inaccurate, because doctoral candidates routinely lie when filling in the survey.  And around and around we goâ€¦
