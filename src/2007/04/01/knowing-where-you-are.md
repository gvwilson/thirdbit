End-of-the-month report time (while the baby is sleeping). Here's what traffic has looked like on the Software Carpentry site since it opened:

And here's this month on the Third Bit blog:

In order, the spikes are:

-   Interviewing at Google (until recently my most-favorite-ever posting)
-   the first post about <em>Beautiful Code</em>
-   the updated chapter list for <em>Beautiful Code</em>
-   the list of organizations participating in Google Summer of Code
-   my daughter's birth announcement

Google Analytics (the source of the information on this blog) also provides geographic information; I know it's not 100% accurate, since it's not showing visitors from continental Africa or Mexico, but it's still pretty cool:

The coolest thing? Sadie and I have had congratulations on Madeleine's birth from every continent except Antarctica.
