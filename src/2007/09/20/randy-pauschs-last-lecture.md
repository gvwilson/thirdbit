<blockquote>When I die, I shall breathe back the breath that made me live. I shall give back to the world all that I didn't do. All that I might have been and wasn't. All the choices I didn't make. All the things I lost and spent and wasted. I shall give them back to the world. To the lives that haven't been lived yet. That will be my gift back to the world that gave me the life I did live, the life I loved, the breath I breathed.

â€” Ursula LeGuin</blockquote>
