Ned Gulley (of <a href="http://www.mathworks.com">The Mathworks</a>) has a great article up called "<a href="http://www.starchamber.com/gulley/pubs/tweaking/tweaking.html">In Praise of Tweaking</a>" that describes a wiki-like programming contest.  An entrant's score is based on both the speed and correctness of his or her code.  What makes it really different is that every entry is immediately posted on the project wiki; competitors are encouraged to tweak one another's entries to get ahead.  As <a href="http://www.starchamber.com/gulley/pubs/tweaking/figure2.png">this figure</a> shows, the result is incremental improvement punctuated by occasional big leaps as someone makes an algorithmic change.  It's a very cool idea; wish I'd thought of it for <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~csc301h">CSC301</a>.
