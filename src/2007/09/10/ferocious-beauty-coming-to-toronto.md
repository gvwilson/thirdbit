"Ferocious Beauty" is a multimedia dance piece which explores genetic research and its impact on society.  (Yes, I know, it sounds a little odd, but friends who have seen it have said it's great.)  The announcement is below; see these <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~gvwilson/ferocious-beauty-1.pdf">two</a> <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~gvwilson/ferocious-beauty-2.pdf">posters</a> for more details.

The Ontario Genomics Institute (OGI) has some very exciting outreach initiatives on tap for the end of this month that I want to let you know about.  These activities centre on the Canadian Premiere of a wonderfully innovative multi-media dance production called *Ferocious Beauty: Genome*, from the Liz Lerman Dance Exchange, presented by OGI from *27-29 September 2007* at 8 pm at the Premiere Dance Theatre, Harbourfront Centre.

Inspired by the mapping of the human genome, this multi-media dance piece is the result of a rare and unique collaboration between artists and scientists, which explores genetic research and its impact on society. The Chicago Sun-Times called it "beautiful, richly imaginative, hugely ambitious… captivating, surprisingly funny, intensely moving, thought provoking…should not be missed by anyone fascinated by the intersection of science and art, or by the morally challenging issues now in play in the field of genetics."

But wait…there's more!  The creator of Ferocious Beauty: Genome, Liz Lerman, and a dancer from her company will be among the panelists for a *free public forum* we are co-hosting with MaRS, here in the MaRS main auditorium, from 6-8 pm on *Monday, September 24th*, entitled "A Meeting of Minds: Art, Science & Popular Culture."  The other panelists are Peter Outerbridge, lead actor in the Canadian TV science drama series, *ReGenesis*; Christina Jennings, creator and executive producer of *ReGenesis*; and Jeff Nisker, clinician, bioethicist and playwright of *Sarah's Daughters and Orchids*. You can register for this free event by emailing rsvp@OntarioGenomics.ca.
