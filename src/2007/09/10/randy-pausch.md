<em>Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams</em>
Tuesday, Sept. 18th, 4:30pm
McConomy Auditorium

Randy Pausch
Professor of Computer Science, HCII, and Design
Co-Founder, Entertainment Technology Center

<em>Almost all of us have childhood dreams: for example, being an astronaut, or making movies or video games for a living. Sadly, most people don't achieve theirs, and I think that's a shame. I had several specific childhood dreams, and I've actually achieved most of them. More importantly, I have found ways, in particular the creation (with Don Marinelli), of CMU's Entertainment Technology Center (etc.cmu.edu), of helping many young people actually *achieve* their childhood dreams.  This talk will discuss how I achieved my childhood dreams (being in zero gravity, designing theme park rides for Disney, and a few others), and will contain realistic advice on how *you* can live your life so that you can make your childhood dreams come true, too.</em>
