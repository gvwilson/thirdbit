O'Reilly has now sold the rights for both Russian and Korean translations of <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596510046/"><em>Beautiful Code</em></a>. W00t!

<em>Later: </em><em>Chinese and </em><em>Japanese translation are in the works as well, to be released in late 2007 and February 2008 respectively. Given how frequently AI criticizes China for human rights abuses, I'll be very interested to watch how the book does thereâ€¦</em>
