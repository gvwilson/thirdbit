Just look at the evidence:
<ul>
  <li>A <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2007/07/06/a-conversation-with-timo-hannay-about-the-scientific-web/">conversation with Timo Hannay</a> at <a href="http://www.nature.com"><em>Nature</em></a> about scientific publishing on the web. (Note: I need to buy an iPod so I can listen to these on the streetcar.)</li>
  <li><a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2007/08/13/podscreenmathslidesketchcasting/">Sketchcasting</a>: recording a whiteboard session with voiceover.</li>
  <li>Thoughts on the <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2007/08/13/transmission-of-tacit-knowledge-teaching-what-we-dont-know-that-we-know/">transmission of tacit knowledge</a>.</li>
</ul>
And then of course there's <a href="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/coscripter/browse/about">CoScripter</a>, which I found through his blog, and now have to internalize.  Ars increasingly longa, vita ever more brevisâ€¦
