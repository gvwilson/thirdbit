Last night's DemoCamp was a great success: packed house, lots of people talking to one another, some great presentations, and of course, pictures of David Crow's new daughter. My picks of the night would be Chris Thiessen's <a href="http://zoomii.ca/">Zoomii</a>, a (very) graphical front-end for shopping on Amazon, and Lillian Angel's <a href="http://langel.wordpress.com/2007/09/18/democamp14/">in-the-pub discussion</a> with <a href="http://www.hyperbio.net/">Leila</a>, but everyone deserved the applause they got. Congrats to David and Jay for a well-run show, and many thanks to the sponsors.

DemoCamp 15 will be hosted by the University of Toronto on October 29. It will run 4-7 instead of 6-9; we hope this will allow people who would otherwise head home to be with their families to attend. Space is once again limited, so please check out the <a href="http://democamp.eventbrite.com/">registration page</a> later this week to reserve a spot (it's free, naturally). We look forward to seeing you all there!
