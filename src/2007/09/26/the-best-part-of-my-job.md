title: "The Best Part of My Job"

The best part of my day is the time I get to spend with my daughter.  The best part of my <em>job</em> is the people I work with.  For example, David Wolever just found <a href="http://blog.codekills.net/archives/27-Fun-with-Firefox-Jitters.html">a possible explanation</a> for the "jitter bug" in Firefox that I <a href="http://blog.codekills.net/archives/27-Fun-with-Firefox-Jitters.html">described yesterday</a>. Turns out the problem is (probably) Javascript sending a second request right behind the one tossed out by the link click.  That's not the cool bit; the cool bit is how he found it, and that he took the time to describe it so clearly.
