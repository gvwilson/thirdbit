Scott McMahan <a href="http://www.sermonaudio.com/new_details3.asp?ID=12380">says nice things</a> about <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596510046/"><em>Beautiful Code</em></a>, while Jonathan Edwards explains <a href="http://alarmingdevelopment.org/?p=79">why he declined to contribute</a>. There's also <a href="http://www.graphic-design.com/news/2007/beautiful_code.html">this review</a> at graphic-design.com, but I couldn't find its author's name; meanwhile, Henry Carstens would like to know <a href="http://www.dailyspeculations.com/wordpress/?p=1942">how the contributors got to be better programmers</a>.  If he can talk them into answering the question, I'd be happy to buy a copy of his bookâ€¦ ;-)

Elsewhere, O'Reilly has posted an <a href="http://www.safaribooksonline.com/whatsnew/oram-wilson.php">interview</a> with me and Andy Oram about the book.
