Over on the <a href="http://beautifulcode.oreillynet.com/"><em>Beautiful Code</em> blog</a>, Michael Feathers writes:
<blockquote>every time someone starts down the path toward making a language simpler and more elegant, they end up at Lisp, Self, or one of the APL-ish languages. There's something elemental about those end points. We keep bumping into them.</blockquote>
and then points at Jonathan Edwards' <a href="http://subtextual.org/">Subtext</a>, one of the most beautiful (though still rough-edged) pieces of software to not make it into the book.
