Interesting <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/hip/papers/Cherubini2007CodeMaps.pdf">paper</a> by Mauro Cherubini et al. looking at when and why software developers draw pictures.  My takeaway is that for most "thinking" purposes, today's computer drawing tools impose overhead without adding value; it's only for "archival" purposes that it's worth cleaning up.  I was very interested in their finding that this is true even for developers with tablets…

And of course, <a href="http://catenary.wordpress.com/2007/08/14/whiteboard-diagramming/">Jorge got there first</a>… ;-)
