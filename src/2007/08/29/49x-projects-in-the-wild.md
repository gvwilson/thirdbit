One of the goals of CSC494/495 (one of my goals, anyway) is to give students a chance to build software that people will actually use. It's therefore been very rewarding to watch the genome browser project grow over the last couple of years.  The latest development is a paper in <a href="http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0000718">PLoS One</a>:
<blockquote>D. Winter, B. Vinegar, H. Nahal, R. Ammar, G. V. Wilson, and N. J. Provart: "An 'Electronic Fluorescent Pictograph' Browser for Exploring and Analyzing Large-Scale Biological Data Sets". PLoS ONE 2(8): e718, 2007.</blockquote>
Three of those names are 49Xersâ€”yay for our side ;-)
