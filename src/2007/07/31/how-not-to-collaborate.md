I posted a note a while back about an upcoming workshop at Microsoft Research on computational education for scientists.  If you read the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/workshops/CEfS2007/">call for papers</a>, you'll discover that there aren't any instructions on how to submit material; nor is there any contact information, other than the generic "contact us" link the bottom corner that gives you nothing more than Microsoft's generic 1-800 number ("press 1 for Windows Vista support…").  After bouncing around for five minutes, I got a human being who told me that she couldn't give out any phone numbers, but I was welcome to fax my question to them…

On the bright side, Microsoft is running <a href="https://www.mses07.net/main.aspx">another computational science conference</a> this fall (in North Carolina).
