Bryan Cantrill, one of the contributors to <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596510046/"><em>Beautiful Code</em></a>, has <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/bmc/entry/beautiful_code">blogged</a> about the possibility of stack overflow in the regular expression code written by Rob Pike that was the subject of Brian Kernighan's chapter.  It's fun to read; I'm looking forward to more crosstalk of this kind.
