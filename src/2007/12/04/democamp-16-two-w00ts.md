Last night's DemoCamp at the Board of Trade went very well. 200+ people in attendance, despite the weather, and some very cool <a href="http://davidcrow.ca/article/1781/democamptoronto16-update">demos and presentations</a>, including two from U of T that got lots of applause:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.igorfoox.com/">Igor Foox</a> demo'd UTest, a reverse testing oracle that he, Pardis Beikzadeh, and Mike Liu built.</li>
  <li>Ryan Schmidt showed off <a href="http://www.shapeshop3d.com/">ShapeShop</a>, a sketch-based 3D modeling tool that looked like a lot of fun.</li>
</ul>
Just as importantly, lots of people were introducing themselves to strangers during the half-time break, and I got to see what <a href="http://isaacezer.com/">Isaac Ezer</a> is going to look like in 30 years when he's all grown up ;-).  It was a good way to end the 'Camp season; I look forward to seeing everyone again in January.
