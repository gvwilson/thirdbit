Two pieces of good news about DrProject this week. First, a report from one of our external users:
<blockquote>The software has been running reliably for so long I forgot how to restart it. For your info, it has been running reliably since August, and the only reason I had to restart it then is because of a power failure.</blockquote>
Second, I will be hiring one of the student developers full-time starting in January to harden and package the code for the next release (which we hope to have ready in March).  Stay tunedâ€¦
