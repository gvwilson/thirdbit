Well, the feline has apparently been debagged: in his keynote at <a href="http://www.cs.potsdam.edu/sigcse07/index.shtml">SIGCSE 2007</a> on Friday, <a href="http://www.cs.potsdam.edu/sigcse07/Speakers.shtml#booch">Grady Booch</a> mentioned the book that <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/36">Andy Oram</a> and I are putting together for <a href="http://www.oreilly.com">O'Reilly</a>. It's called <cite>Beautiful Code: Leading Programmers Explain How They Think</cite>, and contains essays by more than thirty great software developers on, well, beautiful code.  It isn't on <a href="http://www.oreilly.com">O'Reilly</a>'s public site yet, but it's already listed on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Code-Leading-Programmers-Explain/dp/0596510047">Amazon</a>.

I'm proud to have worked on it, and even prouder of the fact that royalties from the book will be donated to <a href="http://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a>.  My only regret is that <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/news/frank_0701.html">Frank Willison</a> isn't here to enjoy it with us.  I hope you all enjoy reading it as much as I hope he would have.

<hr />Later: for those who have left comments / sent email asking, "Why isn't XYZ included?", the answer is probably one of:
<ul>
  <li>we weren't able to reach them,</li>
  <li>we asked, but they declined, or</li>
  <li>we didn't ask this time around, but if you can talk them into contributing to Volume 2, please do so.</li>
</ul>
