Via <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/">Titus Brown</a>, a link to the <em><a href="http://www.insight-journal.org">Insight Journal</a></em>, an open access online publication covering medical image processing. They have a very interesting process requirement: your source code must compile & be verifiable by an automatic system.  I've been expecting something like this for a long time; glad to see it happening.

Later: and, via <a href="http://baderlab.org/">Gary Bader</a>, <em><a href="http://www.scfbm.org/">Source Code for Biology and Medicine</a></em>.  Anyone know of a journal or journals like this for physics, chemistry, geology, and other non-life-science areas?  Or (wistfully) computer science?
