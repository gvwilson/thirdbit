The Computer Science Graduate Student Benevolent Society (CSGSBS) has chosen Al Gore's <a href="http://www.climatecrisis.net/"><em>An Inconvenient Truth</em></a> to show at movie night next week.  In response, not one, but two professors in our department have suggested that people also watch Martin Durkin's trash-science "documentary" <a href="http://www.channel4.com/science/microsites/G/great_global_warming_swindle/index.html"><em>The Great Global Warming Swindle</em></a>.  If the most intelligent and best-educated people in our society can't see that the evidence for anthropogenic warming is now compelling, maybe our species deserves to slip back into the Stone Age.  Or maybe that's just my head cold talkingâ€¦
