The team that put together the "Engineering Strategies & Practice" (ESP) course at <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca">U of T</a> just <a href="http://www.news.utoronto.ca/bin6/070316-3016.asp">won an award</a> from the <a href="http://www.mcmaster.ca/stlhe/welcome.html">Society for Teaching and Learning in Higher Education</a>. From the article:
<blockquote>ESP is required for all first-year engineering students, except those enrolled in engineering science, and includes standard lectures and tutorials but also incorporates seminars &ndash;-- a teaching method usually reserved for upper-year humanities students. The yearlong course finishes with all students participating in an intense 13-week design project, pairing groups of four to six students with a mentor who is either a faculty member or engineering alumni with industry experience.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The students in ESP are currently working on solutions for 150 different design projects for the 2006-2007 academic year. Examples of projects vary from creating a model for a proposed addition to the Boys and Girls Club of East Scarborough to building better online solutions for corporations. Forty groups are currently working with U of T master's students in occupational therapy to design and implement devices for children and adults who have disabilities.</blockquote>
I would really, <em>really</em> like to see something like this in <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca">Computer Science</a>.
