<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Backus">John Backus</a> passed away on Saturday at the age of 82.  He helped invent Fortran and  Backus-Naur form (familiar to everyone who's taken a compiler course), and was later a strong advocate of functional programming languages.  He'll be missedâ€¦
