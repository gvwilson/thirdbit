RailsConf 2007 (a gathering of and for Ruby On Rails developers) is happening right now in Portland.  Next-generation web frameworks, Web 2.0, blah blah blah—all very exciting, but the gender ratio among speakers is 71 to 5 (6.5% female), and from the photos, all but one of the speakers is white.  Looks like more people need to read <a href="http://strange.corante.com/archives/2006/09/04/the_twelve_or_so_step_program_for_conference_speakers_and_organisers.php">Suw Charman's excellent article</a> from last fall…

Which reminds me of a web site I'd really like to see: one that tracks representation of various under-represented groups at conferences.  Side-by-side stats might be a good first step toward fixing some of the things that are broken…

Later: Tim Bray commented on the gender imbalance during his talk, and posted about it <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/05/19/RailsConf">here</a>. Another commentator <a href="http://dyepot-teapot.com/2007/05/19/railsconf-notes-so-far/">reports</a> attendees calling Cyndi Mitchell the "Rachel Ray of code".
