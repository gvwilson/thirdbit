Jon Udell just blogged a link to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2007/11/28/us/politics/20071128_DEBATE_GRAPHIC.html">NY Times Republican debate visualization</a>.  This is just plain cool: not only can you read the transcript while watching the recording, you can jump from section to section, and (in the "Transcript Analyzer" tab) see an overview of who spoke when, and for how long.  Why do we, as software developers, create tools like this for other people, but then not apply them to our own projects?
