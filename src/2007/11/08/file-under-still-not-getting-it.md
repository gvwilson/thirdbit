  String theorist and self-described
  futurist <a href="http://www.mkaku.org/">Michio Kaku</a> has a
  two-page ad for his upcoming BBC TV series <em>Visions of the
  Future</em> (masquerading as an article) in the Nov 3 issue
  of <em>New Scientist</em>. It's pretty depressing: the title is,
  "Are you ready to play god?", and he spends a few paragraphs gushing
  about ubiquitous machine intelligence, growing new organs for people
  in the lab, and how nanotechnology could let us build elevators into
  orbit. Nowhere does he mention the millions of people who die every
  year in developing countries from starvation, war, and preventable
  diseases.  Human rights?  Bahâ€”science is about more toys for the
  haves.  It's about putting a handful of well-fed representatives of
  the industrialized world on Mars to do things that robots can do at
  a twentieth of the cost, not about stopping HIV/AIDS from destroying
  entire cultures in sub-Saharan Africa, or figuring out what the
  people of Dhaka are supposed to do when sea levels rise.

  What makes it ironic (as well as depressing) is that Kaku regularly
  gripes about how uninterested most people are in science.  Maybe
  they're just uninterested in <em>his</em> kind of science.  Ending
  segregation in the American South was a more passionate issue than
  going to the Moon, and rightly so; if scientists like Kaku understood
  that figuring out how to raise a billion people out of abject
  poverty, <em>and then doing it</em>, would be a greater adventure
  than bending light to make things invisible, maybe more people would
  choose to become scientists.
