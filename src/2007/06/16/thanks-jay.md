Jay Goldman of Radiant Core kindly agreed to give us a critique of OLM's interface, so we headed down on Friday and gave him an extended demo.  (When I say "we", I mean Jennifer Campbell, Karen Reid, Martin Williams, and Tony Yiu—bleary-eyed from writing a grant application, I figured the best thing to do was stay out of the way, so I chatted with two ex-students who are now working there.)  It went well: Jay suggested lots of ways we could streamline the workflow, clean up the UI, and generally make OLM look and feel more professional.  Sessions like this are exactly the kind of informal "what you need when you need it" interaction that will help strengthen ties between the university and local companies. So thanks, Jay—much appreciated.
