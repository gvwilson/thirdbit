Prompted by one of Michelle Levesque's posts, I have organized my instant messaging contacts into more rational groups:
<ul>
  <li>Royalty</li>
  <li>Embalmed persons</li>
  <li>Those who are highly trained</li>
  <li>Mermaids</li>
  <li>The fabulous</li>
  <li>Strays</li>
  <li>Those included in the present classification</li>
  <li>Those who tremble as if they were mad</li>
  <li>Those who are not countable</li>
  <li>Components of group minds</li>
  <li>Others</li>
  <li>Those who have just broken a flower vase</li>
  <li>Those who from a long way off look like punctuation</li>
</ul>
<em>Later: my wife's only comment upon seeing this list was, "You misspelled 'embalmed'." I am humbled.</em>
