<a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/articles/070617/25gender.htm">This article</a> from <a href="http://www.usnews.com">US News and World Report</a> says that men can get into many American colleges with lower grades than are required for women:
<blockquote>The reason for these lower admissions rates for female students is simple, if bitterly ironic: From the early grades on up, girls tend to be better students. By the time college admissions come into the picture, many watchers of the "boy gap" agree, it's too late for the lads to catch up on their own.</blockquote>
*sigh*
