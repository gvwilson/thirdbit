<a href="http://www.horsepigcow.com/2007/06/13/the-insidious-danger-of-danger/">Good post</a> from <a href="http://www.horsepigcow.com/">Tara Hunt</a> (ex-Saskatchewan, ex-Toronto, now doing the Web 2.0 startup thang) about how all the warnings and discussion about the crap women have to deal with online contributes to the climate of fear.  Interesting and well-reasoned; comments are worth a read too.  (Via <a href="http://www.ninjatactics.com">Adam Goucher</a>, again.)
