<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596510046/"><em>Beautiful Code</em></a> is in the home stretch: a few more terms need to be indexed, and a few diagrams need to be tidied up, but it's looking very nice.  An author panel is being organized for <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2007/">OSCON</a> in Portland in Julyâ€”I can't go, but I look forward to hearing about it from those of you who can.
