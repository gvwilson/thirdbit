<a href="http://catenary.wordpress.com">Jorge Aranda</a> just posted a description of a <a href="http://catenary.wordpress.com/2007/06/11/playing-it-as-you-think-it-is/">software engineering game</a> that could be used to uncover the differences between academic and industrial views of development.  It's an interesting thought experiment; it would be very cool if someone turned it into a <em>real</em> experiment one day.
