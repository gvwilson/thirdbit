Today I:
<ul>
  <li>Clicked the "submit" button on my first major grant application.</li>
  <li>Got my first copy of <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596510046/"><em>Beautiful Code</em></a> (picture below).</li>
  <li>Sold a science fiction story to <a href="http://www.onspec.ca/"><em>On Spec</em></a> magazine.</li>
  <li>Finished [sic] rewriting the introduction to the first-year Python book we've been working on.</li>
  <li>Lost a game of chess (came out on the short end of a messy trade).</li>
</ul>
I'm now heading out to the pub with students and colleagues.  Life isn't bad.

<em>Later: about forty people showed up at the pub.  Madeleine was, of course, the hit of the party ;-)  Thanks to Serguei for the photo below.</em>
