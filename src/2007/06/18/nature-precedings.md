Tim O'Reilly posted a <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/06/nature_precedin.html">note</a> from Timo Hannay, of <a href="http://www.nature.com"><em>Nature</em></a> magazine, about their new "<a href="http://precedings.nature.com/">Precedings</a>", which:
<blockquote>giv[es] researchers a place to post documents such as preprints and presentations in a way that makes them globally visible and citable.  Submissions are filtered by a team of curators to weed out obviously inappropriate material, but there's no peer-review so accepted contributions appear online very quickly -- usually within a couple of hours.</blockquote>
