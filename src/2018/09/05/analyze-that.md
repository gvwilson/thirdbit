We are conducting a study to find out what questions people who teach computing
would most like researchers to answer. If you teach programming, web design, or
anything else that involves writing code of any kind, in classrooms or
otherwise, at any level, we would like to invite you to take part.

Our study will be done in two parts: the first involves collecting possible
research questions and the second involves ranking the questions collected. As a
participant, you will be involved in only one of these parts, and your
participation will take no more than 5-10 minutes.

If you would like to take part, please provide us with your name and email
address by filling in this form.  We will randomly assign you
to one of the two rounds (either collecting questions or ranking questions) and
contact you shortly thereafter to participate.  You may choose to be entered
into a draw for a $250 gift card.

Thank you very much - we greatly appreciate your contribution!
