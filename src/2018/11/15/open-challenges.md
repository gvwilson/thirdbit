title: "The Real Open Challenges"
---

Two days, two articles I can't access
(and gosh, isn't the use of "open" in the title of the first one ironic).
And please don't tell me that I can probably find a copy if I google hard enough:
that's like saying I'm invited to the party,
but only if I come in through the side door.
