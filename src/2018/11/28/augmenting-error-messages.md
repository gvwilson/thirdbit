title: "Augmenting Error Messages"
---

*Posted on behalf of a colleague: if you're a Python programmer, and
would like to help make using the language easier, they'd appreciate
hearing from you.  You can contact them by email.*

We're a team of researchers from the University of Adelaide in Australia, and
we're trying to make the lives of Python developers easier by producing better
compiler error messages. Compilers often produce cryptic and uninformative
messages that can leave many programmers spending unnecessary time resolving an
error. With the availability of online information and communities, this data
can be utilised to provide enhanced compiler error messages, saving programmers
time and energy when faced with compiler error messages. We have developed a
plugin that is integrated with the popular Sublime Text editor to provide
enhanced compiler error messages for Python. This plugin automatically queries
Stack Overflow and provides summarised information within the IDE. We would now
like to test this plugin with Python developers as part of a user study. If
you're willing to help us out, please contact Emillie Thiselton at
[emillie.thiselton@student.adelaide.edu.au](mailto:emillie.thiselton@student.adelaide.edu.au)
to set up a study session. Sessions will take 60 minutes at most and can be
flexibly scheduled over the next month and a half.
