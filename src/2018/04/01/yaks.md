I'd like to [teach scientists how to program](https://software-carpentry.org),
but that would be a lot easier to do if we had better software tools to offer them.

I'd like to teach undergraduates [how to design better software tools](http://aosabook.org),
but that would be a lot easier to do if they knew more about software engineering.

I'd like to teach undergraduates [an evidence-based introduction to software engineering](http://neverworkintheory.org),
but that would be a lot easier to do if more people knew how to teach well.

I'd like to teach everyone [how to teach well](https://teachtogether.tech/),
but that would be a lot easier to do if people in power actually valued and rewarded good teaching.

I'd like to teach people who *don't* have power where it comes from and how to take it,
but—ah.
OK, I guess I've found the yak I need to shave…
