It's been a couple of years since I supervised a [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) project,
but I still enjoy browsing the projects and seeing what people are up to.
While the [2018 projects page](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/) has a lot of information,
it's not in an easy-to-analyze format,
so [Elizabeth Wickes](https://elizabethwickes.com/) kindly scraped it
and turned it into [a single unified JSON file](@root/files/2018/04/gsoc-2018.json),
which I have now turned into [a summary CSV](@root/files/2018/04/gsoc-2018.csv).
I hope they're useful:
if you find any interesting patterns,
please let me know.
