title: Teaching Tech Together
---

I am pleased to announce the publication of *[Teaching Tech
Together](http://teachtogether.tech/)*, a guide to building and delivering
lessons that work, and creating a teaching community around them.
This book is a much-expanded successor to *How to Teach Programming
(and Other Things)*; as its blurb says:

> Hundreds of grassroots groups have sprung up around the world to
> teach programming, web design, robotics, and other skills outside
> traditional classrooms.  These groups exist so that people don't
> have to learn these things on their own, but ironically, their
> founders and instructors are often teaching themselves how to teach.
>
> There's a better way. Just as knowing a few basic facts about germs
> and nutrition can help you stay healthy, knowing a few things about
> psychology, lesson design, inclusivity, and community organization
> can help you be a more effective teacher. This book presents
> evidence-based practices you can use right now, explains why we
> believe they are true, and points you at other resources that will
> help you go further.

Parts of the book were originally written for Software Carpentry's
instructor training program, which has been run
over a hundred times in the past six years.  You can share and remix

    This book is dedicated to my mother, Doris Wilson,
    <br>
    who taught hundreds of children to read and to believe in themselves,
    <br>
    and to my brother Jeff, who did not live to see it finished.
    <br>
    "Remember, you still have a lot of good times in front of you."
