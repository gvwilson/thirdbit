title: "Link Rot"
---

<p>
  An astute reader pointed out that some links on my site were 404'ing,
  so I ran a check for the first time in a couple of years.
  The results surprised me:
</p>

<table class="centered">
  <tr><th>Year</th><th># Broken</th><th># Total</th><th>%age</th></tr>
  <tr><td>2007</td><td> 80</td><td> 505</td><td>15.8%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2008</td><td>361</td><td>2400</td><td>15.0%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2009</td><td>464</td><td>3055</td><td>15.2%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2010</td><td>314</td><td>2074</td><td>15.1%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2011</td><td>173</td><td>1085</td><td>15.9%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2012</td><td>243</td><td>1384</td><td>17.6%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2013</td><td>138</td><td> 682</td><td>20.2%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2014</td><td>472</td><td>1114</td><td>42.4%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2015</td><td>250</td><td> 962</td><td>26.0%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2016</td><td>100</td><td> 657</td><td>15.2%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2017</td><td> 19</td><td> 336</td><td> 5.7%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2018</td><td>  9</td><td> 374</td><td> 2.4%</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  The first surprise is the way the percentage of broken links stabilizes around 15%
  after a few years.
  The second is the massive jump in 2014;
  after a bit of inspection,
  that turns out to be caused by some posts I imported from the Software Carpentry site
  without fixing cross-links properly.
  The third surprise is the broken links from 2017 and 2018:
  I'm going to have to be more careful going forward.
