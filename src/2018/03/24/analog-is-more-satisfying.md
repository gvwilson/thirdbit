title: "Analog is More Satisfying"
date: 2018-03-24
---

I'm organizing my thoughts about other people's thoughts for
[the next revision](@root/2018/03/20/plan-for-version-3/)
of *[How to Teach Programming (and Other Things)](https://teachtogether.tech/)*,
and have found yet again that moving lines of text around in Emacs
isn't nearly as satisfying as shuffling scraps of paper on a table.

This is a skewed representation of what Version 3 will contain,
since topics that are already adequately covered are under-represented in the new citations.
I'm still looking for more material on free-range teaching (e.g., bootcamps and weekend workshops);
as always,
please [mail me](mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com)
your thoughts and suggestions.
