1.  Be kind: all else is details.
1.  Remember that you are not your learners…
1.  …that most people would rather fail than change…
1.  …and that ninety percent of magic consists of knowing one extra thing.
1.  Never teach alone.
1.  Never hesitate to sacrifice truth for clarity.
1.  Make every mistake a lesson.
1.  Remember that no lesson survives first contact with learners…
1.  …that every lesson is too short from the teacher's point of view and too long from the learner's…
1.  …and that nobody will be more excited about the lesson than you are…
