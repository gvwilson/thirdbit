Toby Hodges and I are very pleased to announce the launch of
*[JavaScript versus Data Science](@root/js4ds/)*,
a tutorial on one of the world's most widely-used languages
for people who want to make their data available and maybe visualize it a bit,
if that wouldn't be too much to ask.
We hope you find it usefulâ€”comments, contributions, fixes, and suggestions are very welcome.
