title: "A Story Line Game for Teaching"
---

In the wake of [yesterday's launch](@root/2018/12/12/js-vs-ds/)
of *[JavaScript versus Data Science](@root/js4ds/)*,
I've been thinking about what I could do in 2019,
and about a party game that I'm fond of called "story lines".
The first person writes an opening sentence on a piece of paper.
The second person adds a sentence,
then folds the paper so that only their sentence is visible.
The third person adds their sentence and folds the paper again,
so that each person only ever sees the immediately preceding line.
When the whole story is read out at the end,
it's always surreal and sometimes hilarious.

So what would the equivalent be for building lessons?
What would it look like if a few dozen people
(like, I dunno, some [Carpentries instructors](https://carpentries.org/instructors/))
each took a turn adding one page to an ever-growing lesson.
They would each be able to see all the previous work—I imagine
the project would have a blog feed,
so contributors and interested parties would get a daily update on what had been added—but
when their turn came,
each person would be free to decide what needed explaining next.

I think it would be a lot of fun,
but my tastes are somewhat eccentric.
If you'd be interested,
or can think of a variation that would make this more fun or more productive,
please [give me a shout](mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com)—I'd be happy to coordinate.
(I apologize for not allowing discussion here:
following my criticism of Shopify's continued support for white nationalist sites,
it seemed best to disable comments on this blog until the trolls turned their attention elsewhere.)
