title: "Be Grateful for the Present You Got"
---

Not long before the end,
I asked my brother [Jeff](@root/2018/03/20/goodbye-jeff/)
if he was angry about his life being cut so short.
He said,
"I try not to be.
If you get a really good present for Christmas,
but someone else gets a better one,
you shouldn't say hey, theirs is betterâ€”you should be grateful for the present you got."

He was always a better man than me,
so as this year draws to a close,
I'm going to try to be more like him
and be grateful for what I have.
