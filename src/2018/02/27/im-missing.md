I've been browsing the [SIGCSE 2018 proceedings](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3159450)
(which for once I was able to read legally),
and as [I wrote last week](@root/2018/02/18/teaching-programming-in-the-wild/),
I'm repeatedly struck by my own absence.
There are a handful of mentions of free-range instruction,
like [this paper by Burke and others](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3159485),
but the overwhelming majority of studies focus on formal educational settings.
A lot of [end-user developers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-user_development)
pick up their skills on their own, in weekend workshops, or in bootcamps,
not in institutional classrooms;
it would be nice for those of us who teach that way to see ourselves in the research literature,
and to be able to learn more about what we're doing when we read it.
