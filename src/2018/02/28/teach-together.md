title: "Workshop on Organizing for Progressive Community Change"
date: 2018-02-28

A growing number of people who work in tech want to be involved in
progressive community change, but have never been part of grassroots
initiatives before. We are therefore pleased to announce that
Alejandra Bravo and Graham Mitchell will be running a one-day hands-on
workshop on Saturday, April 7 in Toronto to teach people how to figure
out what their community actually needs, how to rally and organize
volunteers, and how to build relationships with local institutions and
like-minded groups. For more information, and to apply to attend,
please go to <http://teachtogether.tech/>
and please share this announcement with anyone who might be
interested.

(And if you're looking for other events that Saturday, check out
<http://girlsintechcon.com>, a one-day conference for girls in grades
6-8 who are interested in tech.)
