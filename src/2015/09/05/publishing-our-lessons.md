  It's been a long time coming,
  but we have finally published Version 5.3 of our core lessons.
  Please cite them as:

  The contributors to each lesson are listed in the Zenodo record as authors, in alphabetical order by surname.
  Unfortunately,
  this means that the automatically-generated "Cite as" on their Zenodo pages doesn't match what's above:
  as previously noted,
  bibliographic systems don't recognize lessons as a first-class type,
  and don't yet accommodate common open source conventions like maintainers.
</p>
<p>
  But that's just grumbling.
  185 people have contributed in various ways to these seven lessons,
  and we should be very proud both of what we have created and of the trail we're blazing.
