  We are very pleased to announce that Jonah Duckles
  has accepted the position of Executive Director of the Software Carpentry
  Foundation, and will start on Monday, October 5, 2015.
  Jonah was most recently the Director of Informatics and Innovation
  at the University of Oklahoma where he partnered with researchers to improve
  their computational workflows while developing maker spaces for the campus.
  He holds a BS in Physics and an MS in Forestry and Natural Resources,
  both from Purdue, and has been a very active contributor to Software Carpentry
  for several years.

  As we discussed in July,
  Jonah and Greg Wilson will job-share during a short transition period,
  after which Jonah will devote himself to building relations with partners,
  overseeing the development of our curriculum,
  being Software Carpentry's spokesperson,
  and working with the Steering Committee to set our future direction,
  while Greg focuses on instructor training.
  As with the election of the Steering Committee in January,
  splitting these two roles is another sign of Software Carpentry's growing success.
</p>
<p>
  Please give Jonah your warmest welcome,
  and stay tuned for more exciting news.
