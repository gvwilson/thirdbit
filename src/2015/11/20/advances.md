  Alfred North Whitehead once said that
  civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform
  without thinking about them.
  I've recently realized that something similar is true of organizations and email:
  the surest sign of how far Software Carpentry has come in the last 12 months
  is that I now only need to respond to forty or fifty of the Software Carpentry-related messages
  that land in my inbox every day,
  rather than all 200 or so.
  It's actually quite wonderful.
