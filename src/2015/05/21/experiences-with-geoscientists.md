  Christian Jacobs,
  Gerard Gorman,
  and Lorraine Craig
  have written a paper titled
  "<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05425">Experiences with efficient methodologies for teaching computer programming to geoscientists</a>"
  that describes how their intro to computing course has changed over the last few years.
  It includes discussion of ideas they've borrowed from Software Carpentry,
  and some data on hwo students have responded.
  It's a good read,
  and we'd welcome more experience reports of this kind.
