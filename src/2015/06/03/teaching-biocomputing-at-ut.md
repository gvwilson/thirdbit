  has just posted an article about her experiences
  <a href="http://www.rebeccatarvin.com/#!Teaching-biocomputing-at-UT/clfr/556f16020cf293eac7f7bb9a">teaching biocomputing at the University of Texas</a>.
  Like last month's report on
  teaching geoscientists,
  it's a welcome chance to compare what Software Carpentry does with
  what's possible in more conventional academic settings.
  As Becca says in summary:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    From student surveys we note that students benefit greatly from our online resources,
    including cheatsheets, markdown lessons, and example code,
    and they like live-coding more than PowerPoint presentations.
    Although it's difficult to keep attendance up over the semester,
    the students that attend/use the online resources greatly improve their coding abilities.
    We are working to improve the accessibility of our course to all levels of programmers
    by offering additional resources including Open Coding Hour and by creating an online forum.
