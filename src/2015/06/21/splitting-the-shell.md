  has written <a href="http://blog.rgaiacs.com/2015/06/18/swc_shell.html">a short post</a>
  about a trick he found (via Kate Hertweck)
  for splitting the terminal window when teaching the shell
  so that recent commands stay visible at the top.
  It's a clever idea;
  we would welcome feedback from other instructors who have tried it
  or similar things.
  And if you have tricks of your own that you'd like to share,
  please let us knowâ€“we'd be happy to feature them here.
