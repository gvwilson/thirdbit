  Little by little, the subversive features of the computer were eroded away.
  Instead of cutting across and challenging the very idea of subject boundaries,
  the computer now defined a new subject;
  instead of changing the emphasis from impersonal curriculum to excited live exploration by students,
  the computer was now used to reinforce School's ways.
  What had started as a subversive instrument of change
  was neutralized by the system and converted into an instrument of consolidation.
