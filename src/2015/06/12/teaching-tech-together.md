  Last weekend,
  30 people from a broad range of grassroots groups
  that are trying to increase diversity in tech
  got together in Boulder
  to compare experiences and swap best practices.
  The <a href="http://t3summit.org/">home page</a> for the meeting has some background,
  but <a href="https://storify.com/gvwilson/teaching-tech-together">this storify</a>
  does a better job of capturing the excitement.

  I hope this will help start a conversation that's long overdue.
  Too many people in tech speak and act as if knowledge only needs to flow one way â€“
  as if everyone who can't program should just show up and learn.
  The truth is,
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rules-Radicals-Practical-Primer-Realistic/dp/0679721134/">social change is a skill too</a>,
  one that's at least as difficult to master as Javascript
  but a lot more important.
  If people in tech really want to change the world,
  we need to listen to people who know how to organize,
  find allies,
  and get Big Dumb Organizations to change.
  Because if we don't do that,
  all the Javascript in the world isn't going to matter one damn bit.
