  The Software Carpentry Foundation's Steering Committee has voted to add
  a Contributor Covenant
  to our lessons and other repositories.
  Like the Code of Conduct for our workshops,
  the Contributor Covenant's aim is
  to ensure that participation in Software Carpentry is a harassment-free experience for everyone,
  regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
  disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion.
