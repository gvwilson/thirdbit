Inspired by <a href="http://catenary.wordpress.com/2007/12/31/2007-recommendations-books/">Jorge's list</a> (but sadly, no <a href="http://catenary.wordpress.com/2007/12/31/2007-recommendations-games/">games</a>):

Sandra Boynton: <cite>Your Personal Penguin</cite>.  Workman Publishing, 2006, 0761143726.  <em>Now, lots of other penguins seem to be fine // In a universe of nothing but ice. // But if I could be yours, and you could be mine, // Our cozy little world would be twice as nice. // I want to be Your Personal Penguin.</em>

Stephen J. Ceci and Wendy M. Williams (eds): <cite>Why Aren't More Women in Science?</cite> American Psychological Association, 2006, 159147485X.  Chapters written by leading researchers on both sides of the nature vs. nurture debate.  Dense and dry, but fascinating.

Frances Hardinge: <em>Fly By Night</em>. Harper-Collins, 2006, 0060876271. An orphan named Mosca and her not-really-very-tame attack goose get caught up in a revolutionary plot; delivers the heft and page-turning pleasure Pullman's <em>Dark Materials</em> trilogy eventually failed to.
Margo Lanagan: <cite>Black Juice</cite>.  Eos, 2006, 0060743921. The setting of these graceful, disturbing stories is never quite our world, but never quite not.

Scott Lynch: <cite>The Lies of Locke Lamora</cite>.  Spectra, 2007, 055358894X.  An orphan becomes a criminal mastermind, but at a priceâ€”pure swashbuckling fun.

Michael Nygard: <cite>Release It!</cite> Pragmatic Bookshelf, 2007, 0978739213.  It could equally well have been called, "how to make enterprise-scale applications work in the real world."

Ellen Ullman: <cite>Close to the Machine</cite>.  City Lights, 1997, 0872863328.  As the dot-com wave swelled towards crest and collapse, Ullman had to decide whether to ride it or let it slip by. An engaging phase-of-life memoir.
