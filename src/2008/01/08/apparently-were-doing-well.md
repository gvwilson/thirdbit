From <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/213312505/a_year_in_oreilly_books.html">today's post</a> by Tim O'Reilly:
<blockquote><a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596510046/index.html">Beautiful Code</a>, a collection of essays by master programmers about how they solved particularly hard problems, must have hit a nerve. It was our #9 bestselling title for the year, and the number one software engineering title industry-wide according to our analysis of Bookscan figures.</blockquote>
