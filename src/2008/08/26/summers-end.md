The last of our summer students finishes at the end of this week; here's a few links to close off another great season:
<ul>
  <li>Dan Servos has finished his <a href="http://hackerdan.com/gsoc/end-of-my-summer-of-code/">grade statistics visualization plugin for Moodle</a>.</li>
  <li>Victoria Mui has been <a href="http://idea021.wordpress.com/2008/08/19/wrapping-up/">having fun with springs</a>—her screencast is <a href="http://blip.tv/file/1233159/">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Eva Wong <a href="http://iwa-wong.livejournal.com/5072.html">wishes she had a time machine</a> (but had fun nevertheless).</li>
  <li>Matthew Basset thinks <a href="http://mbasset.wordpress.com/2008/08/20/lessons-learned-from-gsoc-2008-or-in-other-words-the-final-post/">voiceovers are hard</a>.</li>
  <li>Liz Blankenship has been thinking about <a href="http://www.lizblankenship.com/drproject/blog/?p=19">simplifying tickets</a> (a <a href="http://www.lizblankenship.com/drproject/blog/?p=26">mockup</a> is available); she has also posted some musings about the <a href="http://www.lizblankenship.com/drproject/blog/?p=21">divergent evolution of Trac and DrProject</a>.</li>
  <li>Qiyu Zhu has posted a screencast of the new-and-improved administration interface.</li>
  <li>Jeff Balogh says "thanks for all the fish" to his <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/2008/09/02/soc-wrapup-drag-drop-form-editor">drag-and-drop form editor</a>.</li>
</ul>

Thanks again, everyone—I really enjoyed working with you all.
