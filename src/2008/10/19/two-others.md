In amongst a bunch of programming books, I also found time this summer to read a few for fun, like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Victory-Eagles-Temeraire-Book-5/dp/0345496884">latest in the Temeraire series</a>. The two I enjoyed most were Felix Gilman's debut novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thunderer-Felix-Gilman/dp/055359110X"><em>Thunderer</em></a>, and Michael Chabon's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gentlemen-Road-Adventure-Michael-Chabon/dp/0345502078"><em>Gentlemen of the Road</em></a>. The former is a match for K. J. Bishop's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Etched-City-K-J-Bishop/dp/0553382918"><em>The Etched City</em></a> (think China Mieville, but less self-consciously anxious to impress); the latter, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Yiddish-Policemens-Union-Novel/dp/0007149824"><em>The Yiddish Policemen's Union</em></a>, is proof that Chabon has finally learned that too much is <em>not</em> a good thing. I wouldn't call either book deep, but they're both nice and chewy.
