I just got sales figures for <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596510046/"><em>Beautiful Code</em></a> from <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a>: since its release last summer, it has raised more than US$38,000 for <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a>.  My thanks once again to the authors, and to everyone at O'Reilly who helped make the project a realityâ€”and, of course, to everyone who bought the book as well.
