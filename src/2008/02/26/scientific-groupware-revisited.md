<a href="http://www.nature.com"><em>Nature</em></a> would like "t<a href="http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2008/02/a_tangled_web_we_weave.html">o hear from physicists</a> what kind of tools would help in managing the ever-growing tide of information from, and the exciting possibilities of, the internet."  (I presume scientists in lesser disciplines will be asked to chip in at a later date ;-).  It will be interesting to see how much (if anything) has changed since Jon Udell wrote "<a href="https://www.jonudell.net/GroupwareReport.html">Internet Groupware for Scientific Collaboration</a>" eight years ago.
