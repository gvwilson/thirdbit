Yesterday was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Day">Family Day</a>, a new Ontario holiday.  It was also the start of Reading Week (no classes at <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca">U of T</a>), but David, Yi Qing, Luke, and Qiyu were in anyway, beavering away to get DrProject ready for <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2008/about/">PyCon</a> while I wrote reports.  (I miss codingâ€¦)  16 new tickets created; 19 completed (but 3 reopened); 29 changesets checked in; five sub sandwiches eaten (along with three large chocolate milk, one regular milk, and an orange juice for the old guy).  We're starting up again in an hour and a half; there's a ton to be done, but it's looking better all the time.
