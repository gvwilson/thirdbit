<a href="http://on-ruby.blogspot.com/2008/02/ip-police-line-do-not-cross.html">This post</a> is more than slightly surreal: a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mining-Talk-Unlocking-Unstructured-Information/dp/0132339536">new book on data mining</a> by two IBM employees includes the following paragraph in its introduction:
<blockquote>On the other hand, if you want to take our methods and create your own software solution to sell as a product, while we applaud your initiative and enthusiasm, you really should first discuss this with suitable representatives from <span class="caps">IBM</span> business development.  <span class="caps">IBM</span> has sole ownership of all the intellectual property described in this book, all of which is protected by U.S. patents, both granted and pending. All rights reserved, etc., etc.</blockquote>
As one of the commenters says, that's radioactive: I'd stop reading the book right away for fear of later being sued for infringement.
