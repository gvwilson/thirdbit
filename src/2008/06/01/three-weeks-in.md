Our summer interns are three weeks in, and making great progress:
<ul>
  <li>Nicole Allard (Eclipse Feature Diagram Plugin): isn't blogging, so I don't know.</li>
  <li>Jeff Balogh (Dojo Form Editor): has been working with Nick Jamil on a new customizable ticketing system for DrProject, and has also <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/2008/05/31/soc-week-1-semi-random-thoughts">posted some thoughts</a> at the end of his first week working on a drag-and-drop form editor for Dojo. Misleading debugging tools—check, but SVN plus patches considered harmful? Hm… What he actually says is, "Dojo, like a lot of other projects, is still using svn. This is great for, um, somebody, but I think it's more detrimental than good for open source projects." He likes the GIT way of doing things ("send it to the list").</li>
  <li>Matthew Basset (Hackystat Visual Studio Plugin): gosh, isn't it nice when <a href="http://mbasset.wordpress.com/2008/05/29/isnt-it-cool-how-sometimes-things-just-work/">everything just runs</a>…</li>
  <li>Ming Chow and Wenbing Li (Flare Dataflow Editor): <a href="http://pipe3f.wordpress.com/2008/05/24/dragging-my-way-to-the-bank/">drag and drop</a>, drag and drop, it's so much fun, we just can't stop.</li>
  <li>Geofrey Flores and Qi Yang (Eclipse Web-CAT Plugin): whoo boy, <a href="http://summerwebcat.wordpress.com/2008/05/30/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-eclipse/">isn't WebObjects fun?</a>  And trying to get a compatible mix of versions of various packages?  Woo hoo…</li>
  <li>Eran Henig (Python Web-CAT Back End): as above (the three students share a blog).  <a href="http://web-cat.cs.vt.edu/">Web-CAT</a> now knows how to run Python programs; the next step is to teach it how to run them securely.</li>
  <li>Nick Jamil (DrProject): has been <a href="http://nickjamil.livejournal.com/6837.html">blogging</a> several times a day about ideas, progress, and discoveries.  He'd be interested in hearing your thoughts on the <a href="http://nickjamil.livejournal.com/6042.html">database schema</a> for the new ticketing component.</li>
  <li>Xuan Le (OS161 Visualization): is already <strike>building</strike> <a href="http://os161viz.blogspot.com/2008/05/week-3.html">debugging</a> a GUI for the os161 visualization tool.</li>
  <li>Chris Maddison (PyGraphics): doesn't appear to be blogging either, but his project partner, Hardeep Singh, has just started (see below).</li>
  <li>Victoria Mui (Cytoscape Graph Layout): can now <a href="http://idea021.wordpress.com/2008/05/28/up-and-running/">debug Cytoscape plugins in Eclipse</a>.  Time to get back to graph layout…</li>
  <li>Luke Petrolekas (Documentation/Testing): has converted the Software Carpentry notes to a wiki.  There's still lots to do (embedding images, tidying up the bibliography, etc.), but it's a great start.</li>
  <li>Daniel Servos (Moodle Data Visualization): came down to chat a week ago about what instructors would actually like to visualize, and is now working on a final design and figuring out <a href="http://hackerdan.com/programing/debugging-moodle/">how to debug</a> <a href="http://www.moodle.org">Moodle</a>.</li>
  <li>Hardeep Singh (PyGraphics): has just <a href="http://www.theootz.com/blog/36-blog/48-fun-with-threads-and-wingide-plus-a-little-intro.html">started blogging</a>.</li>
  <li>Dmitri Vassiliev (SlashID): is <a href="http://slashid.wordpress.com/2008/05/29/the-three-stooges/">running into landmines</a> all over the place.  As always, <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">GWT</a> and other toolkits are only as usable as they are debuggable…</li>
  <li>Eva Wong (Hackystat Data Visualization): is <a href="http://iwa-wong.livejournal.com/1281.html">getting on top of Flash</a>, and starting to think about how to get data out of the <a href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/Research/Hackystat/">Hackystat</a> sensorbase.</li>
  <li>Joseph Yeung (OpenAFS Control Panel): really should <a href="http://openafsmmc.wordpress.com/2008/05/20/openafs-kerberos-best-pratices-workshop/">blog more often</a>…</li>
  <li>Kosta Zabashta (DrProject Chat): has discovered that getting data out of IRC and into DrProject is the easy part; the hard part is <a href="http://drprojectirc.wordpress.com/2008/05/30/drproject-chat-log-interface/">how to display it</a>.  Your comments would be welcome…</li>
  <li>Qiyu Zhu (DrProject Admin): has been fixing bugs, and more recently talking to <a href="http://www.lizblankenship.com/">Liz Blankenship</a> (our <a href="http://season.openusability.org/">Season of Usability</a> intern, now based in Seattle) about <a href="http://qzdrproject.wordpress.com/2008/05/30/ui-ideas-for-managing-roles-and-capabilities/">a role editor</a> for DrProject.</li>
</ul>
