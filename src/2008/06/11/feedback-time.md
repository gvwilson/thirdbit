Daniel Servos is just about ready to put a text-based version of his Moodle stats plugin up for public comment—<a href="http://hackerdan.com/programing/gradereportstats/">screenshots are already available</a>. Your feedback would be greatly appreciated.  I'll be begging for feedback on other students' projects as well just as soon as they have pixels on the screen.

Meanwhile, Nick and Jeff are making steady progress on DrProject's new ticketing system. If <a href="http://nickjamil.livejournal.com/9168.html">this schematic</a> is any indication, we're going to need a <em>lot</em> of maintenance documentation…
