  <li>Kosta Zabashta has posted a screenshot of a new interface for navigating IRC logs in DrProject. It displays a sidebar of the project's event log; clicking on an event takes you to the portion of the IRC log closest in time to the chosen event.  Feedback is, as always, welcome.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile, Qiyu Zhu is working through the design of a new role editor, and believes that dumb redirects interact poorly with forms. Suggestions, anyone?</li>
  <li>Jeff Balogh has a post up at DojoCampus about <a href="http://dojocampus.org/content/2008/06/24/extending-dojodnd-with-a-creator-function/">extending dojo.dnd with a creator function</a>. As Douglas Crockford says in his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742">new book</a>, Javascript is actually more like Lisp than Java.</li>
  <li>Joseph Yeung's MMC plugin for OpenAFS is <a href="http://openafsmmc.wordpress.com/2008/06/24/it-worked/">loading</a>! (Damn those memory boundaries anyway…)</li>
  <li>Daniel Servos is <a href="http://hackerdan.com/programing/i-can-haz-data/">loading data</a>. It's not as easy as you might think…</li>
  <li>Victoria Mui has <a href="http://idea021.wordpress.com/2008/06/24/no-more-squares/">fewer squares</a> than she used to have.</li>
  <li>Eran Henig discovers that <a href="http://summerwebcat.wordpress.com/2008/06/25/securing-python-on-linux/">deviant builds of Python</a> for odd debugging tasks are still easier than getting Web-CAT to compile.</li>
</ul>
