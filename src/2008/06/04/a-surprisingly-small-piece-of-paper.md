title: "A Surprisingly Small Piece of Paper"

At quarter after ten last night, in our pajamas, Sadie and I signed the papers to buy a new house.  (Well, new for us: it was built in the 1920s, and the previous owner lived in it for 51 years.)  This afternoon I picked up a check at the bank and handed it over to the real estate agent as a down payment.  It seemed like such a small piece of paper, considering everything that was riding on it… We take possession at the end of August; lots of renos to do (knob and tube wiring—yee hah), but we're very excited.
