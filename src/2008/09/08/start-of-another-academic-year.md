It's September, so here we go againâ€¦ Samira, <a href="http://www.aperte.org">Jeremy</a>, Carolyn, and I welcomed <a href="http://littlecomputerscientist.wordpress.com/">Aran Donohue</a>, Alicia Grubb, Zachary Kincaid, <a href="http://www.jaysnothere.com/blog/">Jason Montojo</a>, and <a href="http://rorytulk.blogspot.com/">Rory Tulk</a> to the team today. It'll be March or April before they've got research topics, but I'll add links to their blogs when I get them. David Bolter of the <a href="http://atrc.utoronto.ca/">ATRC</a> and I are also starting a project with <a href="http://ajfowler.wordpress.com/">Alecia Fowler</a> of Environment Canada, who wants to look at making web-based maps accessible to people with visual and physical disabilities.

And I'm teaching two courses: CSC301 (Introduction to Software Engineering) and CSC491 (Computer Science Capstone). Students in the former will be building an image diff/merge tool for use with version control systems as their course projects; students in the latter will get to choose a project from a list of about 15 put up by U of T profs, local non-profits, and colleagues in various startups and open source groups. I'm pitching to them on Wednesday at noon, and I'm still accepting proposals until 9:00 pm tonight.
