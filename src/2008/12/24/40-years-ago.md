I can just barely remember lying on the living room floor watching the first moon landing on a little black and white TV. (Apparently, I turned to the adults who were clapping and crying and saying, "Is that it?")  This picture was from the earlier <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2008/12/22/40-years-later-remembering-the-boldness-of-apollo-8/">Apollo 8</a> expedition, forty years ago today. I wonder what it will look like forty years from now?
