And while we're wrapping up the term: when we started rebuilding DrProject on top of Django in September, <a href="http://bwinton.latte.ca/resume.html">Blake Winton</a> volunteered to help out.  Since then, he has done detailed line-by-line code reviews on over half of our 950 commits, been a voice of reason during online design discussions, and shown the whole team (myself included) how a mature, even-tempered, and good-humored developer gets things done.  We wouldn't be anywhere near as far along as we are without him, so thanks, Blakeâ€”we really appreciate it.
