<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/12/12/comfort-with-meaning.html">BoingBoing finally noticed the "camel has two humps" study</a>, in which Saeed Dehnadi and Richard Bornat claimed that a simple test could tell whether someone would be a good programmer or not before they'd ever written a single line of code.  They mention at the bottom that Jonathan Lung, Jorge Aranda, Steve Easterbrook, and I were <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sme/papers/2008/Lung-ICSE2008.pdf">unable to replicate the original study's results</a>.  I suppose that's fame of a sort…

(Footnote: the title of the BoingBoing article comes from the claim in Dehnadi and Bornat's work that good programmers are people who are comfortable with programs being intrinsically meaningless.  Even if their test doesn't work, it's a useful point…)
