I'm very pleased to pass on Adam Goucher's <a href="http://adam.goucher.ca/?p=684">announcement</a> that he and Tim Riley (of Mozilla) will be helming a sequel to <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596510046"><em>Beautiful Code</em></a> called <em>Beautiful Testing</em>. Proceeds will go to <a href="http://www.nothingbutnets.net/">Nothing But Nets</a>, which provides mosquito nets to malaria-infested regions in Africa.  <em>BT</em> will be the third "sequel", joining <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596517984/"><em>Beautiful Architecture</em></a> (due out any day now) and <em>Beautiful Data</em> (which is just getting rolling).  Congratulations!
