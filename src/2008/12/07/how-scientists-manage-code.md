The <a href="http://cise.aip.org/dbt/dbt.jsp?KEY=CSENFA&amp;Volume=CURVOL&amp;Issue=CURISS">latest issue of <em>Computing in Science &amp; Engineering</em></a> has a paper by David Matthews, Steve Easterbrook, and myself titled "Configuration Management for Large-Scale Scientific Computing at the UK Met Office". It describes how the folks who do climate modeling in the UK built a configuration management tool on top of <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org">Trac</a> to handle their million-line code base.
