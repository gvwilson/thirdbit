…but mostly fun: DemoCamp 18 was last night, and as <a href="http://langel.wordpress.com/2008/07/16/democamp18/">Lillian's review</a> says, it went pretty well.  The venue was too small, and as she said, some of the off-color humor was a little tiresome, but it was good to see such a strong turnout from U of T, and Kosta Zabashta (with Victoria Mui's help) did a great job of showing off his integration of DrProject and IRC. Special thanks to the sponsors, and <a href="http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa081797.htm">Willis Haviland Carrier</a> for the luxury of modern air conditioning.

The next 'camp will probably be in September—look forward to seeing you all there.
