We had our second student-industry lunch yesterday, and I think it was just as much a success as the first one. My thanks to everyone from <a href="http://www.engcorp.com">Engenuity</a>, <a href="http://www.firestoker.com/">Firestoker</a>, <a href="http://www.ibm.com">IBM</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>, <a href="http://www.mitacs.ca/index.htm">MITACS</a>, <a href="http://www.mukodu.com">Mukodu</a>, <a href="http://www.oce-ontario.org/Pages/Home.aspx">OCE</a>, <a href="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</a>, <a href="http://www.scimatic.com/">Scimatic</a>, and <a href="http://www.zerofootprint.net">ZeroFootprint</a> who came out to chat to our students about life in the real world (and to give them a chance to practice their elevator pitches).
