Tuesday was Kosta's turn; today was Victoria Mui's.  Having spent most of the last week and a half reading source code, she got up a few minutes ago and <a href="http://idea021.wordpress.com/2008/07/17/cytoscape-retreat-2008-automatic-label-plugin-progress/">gave a quick talk</a> about her Google Summer of Code project at the Cytoscape retreat. I was impressed once again with how well she presented her workâ€”our students do us proud.
