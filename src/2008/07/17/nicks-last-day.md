Tomorrow is Nick Jamil's last day with usâ€”he'ss done a great job of building a variable-speed ticketing system for DrProject, but now he's got to put all that energy into getting married :-) To wrap up, he has put two posts on his blog:
<ol>
  <li>The problems that <a href="http://drpnewt.wordpress.com/2008/07/17/32-join-limit-in-sqlite/">join limits in SQLite</a> are causing (and the ways he's tried to get around them).</li>
  <li>A new-and-improved <a href="http://drpnewt.wordpress.com/2008/07/17/newt-screencast-2/">screencast</a> of what the system can do.</li>
</ol>
It's been a pleasure working with him; I hope I get the chance to do so again.  Happy nuptials, dude.
