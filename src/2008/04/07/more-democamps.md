David Crow really started something: the first DemoCamp Victoria was apparently a success [<a href="http://blog.bootuplabs.com/2008/04/07/successful-first-democamp-in-victoria/">1</a>, <a href="http://www.techvibes.com/blog/democamp-victoria-a-hit/">2</a>], and there's one <a href="http://blog.bootuplabs.com/2008/03/24/democampvancouver06-gaming-edition-on-april-10th-2008/">coming up</a> in Vancouver on April 10.  If only there was a consolidated blog with announcements and reviews of all of themâ€”it would be cool to see how far the meme has spread.
