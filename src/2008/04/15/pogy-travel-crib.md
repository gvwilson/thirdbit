Madeleine is now a year, two weeks, and one day old. Still only has two teeth, but love gnawing on bananas (and occasionally fingers); walkin' up a storm, and we're the proud owners of two hand-painted… um… paintings.

It folds up into a disk about the size of two frisbees stacked on one another, weights half a kilo, sets up in seconds, and is easy to clean. If you're doing the rounds of friends &amp; family with a newborn, I can't say enough good things about it.
