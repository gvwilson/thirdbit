I can't remember the last time I read three books in a row that <a href="http://www.librarything.com/catalog/gvwilson">I really liked</a>:
<ul>
  <li>Robert Hutchinson: <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elizabeths-Spymaster-Francis-Walsingham-England/dp/0312368224">Elizabeth's Spymaster: Francis Walsingham and the Secret War That Saved England</a></em>. (Precede or follow with Patricia Finney's excellent novel <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Firedrakes-Eye-Patricia-Finney/dp/0312180942">Firedrake's Eye</a></em> for best effect. Would someone please make a movie of this?)</li>
  <li>Michael Chabon: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Yiddish-Policemens-Union-Novel/dp/0007149824"><em>The Yiddish Policeman's Union</em></a>.</li>
  <li>Catherynne M. Valente: <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Orphans-Tales-Night-Garden/dp/0553384031">In the Night Garden</a></em>.</li>
</ul>
Of course, this means I have a stack of technical books waiting for me;  I hope at least one is as good.
