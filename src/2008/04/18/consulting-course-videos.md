There's a metric shoeful of demo videos up on the consulting course web site now showing off what students did this term.  I (or rather Samira and Jeremy, two of my grad students) would be particularly interested in comments on their tool for <a href="http://aperte.org/2008/04/18/threading-software-project-histories/">threading project histories</a>â€”it's going to be the focus of their research, and I think it's a very cool idea.
