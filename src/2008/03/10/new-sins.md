In Niven and Pournelle's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inferno-Larry-Niven/dp/0671826581"><em>Inferno</em></a>, the protagonist discovers that sections of Hell have been set aside for the committers of sins that have not yet been invented.  Apparently, part of that space was for people engaged in "<a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2008/03/genetic_modification_joins_lus.html">genetic modification</a>" (oh, and pollution).  No mention of spam, though, which I frankly find disappointing.
