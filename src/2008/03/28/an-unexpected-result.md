title: "An Unexpected Result"

This term, the students in my third-year software engineering course have been working in teams to build a shared to-do list plugin for <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>.  Each of the six teams has worked independently (well, as independently as students ever work) for the first three exercises.  For the fourth, each team conducted a review of every other team's code to decide which one they would continue with for the final exercise.  They <em>had</em> to switch: teams were not allowed to continue with their own code.

<a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~dw/">Dave Wortman</a> has been doing this "review and buy" exercise for a couple of decades. This time, the result is almost a perfect permutation:
<ul>
  <li>Cereal and Pancakes have bought Waffles.</li>
  <li>Eggs has bought Fruitbar.</li>
  <li>Fruitbar has bought Cereal.</li>
  <li>Porridge has bought Eggs.</li>
  <li>Waffles has bought Pancakes.</li>
</ul>
I was surprised, as I'd been expecting there to be a clear winner.  I'll be reviewing (and grading) the reviews over the next few days; it'll be interesting to see whether groups got different answers because they're using different criteria, or because… um… hm, I don't have another hypothesis just yet.
