I'm pleased to announce that <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~campbell">Jennifer Campbell</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~pgries">Paul Gries</a>, <a href="http://www.digitaldorkroom.com">Jason Montojo</a>, and I have signed a contract with the <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/">Pragmatic Programmers</a> to do a textbook for CS1 in Python.  We already have 356 pages to edit, and we plan to have beta copies to hand out at <a href="http://www.cs.duke.edu/sigcse08/">SIGCSE'08</a> in Portland next week.  W00t!
