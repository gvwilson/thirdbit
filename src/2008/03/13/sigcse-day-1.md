0800: Jeff at <a href="http://www.documart.com">Documart</a> tells me our 50 pre-prints will arrive at 1000—yay!

0815: Breakfast at Starbucks. It actually does taste better on the Left Coast.

1000: 50 pre-prints of our "CS-1 in Python" book arrive. They're heavy.

1030: The panel I organized on "CS-1 for Scientists" starts. Room is half full, but people keep coming in, so by 1100 there are 110 (plus or minus), all awake. <a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~alvarado/">Christine Alvarado</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~campbell/">Jennifer Campbell</a>, <a href="http://www.physics.orst.edu/~rubin/">Rubin Landau</a>, and <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/">Robert Sedgewick</a> do a great job; the audience is very engaged, and my voice doesn't give out. Much discussion ensues; pre-prints are snapped up.

1200: On the train to go downtown for lunch (pecan-crusted catfish with mashed potatoes, and a pint of very nice amber ale). Much discussion there and back.

1400: The "Nifty Assignments" session is packed, so chat with <a href="http://cs.union.edu/~barr/">Valerie Barr</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/~bsimon/">Beth Simon</a>, Bob Sedgewick (again), <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/mark.guzdial/">Mark Guzdial</a>, and others.

1635: Another rendition of "Personal Penguin" via phone for Maddie. Hate being away from family.

1715: Hook up with <a href="http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/~wgg/">Bill Griswold</a> and head for the BOFs and reception at the Hilton. Sun is coming out.

1800: BOF on algorithm visualization is a bust.

1900: <a href="http://web-cat.cs.vt.edu/">Web-CAT</a> user group meeting is definitely not—need to talk to these people some more.

2130: Back at the hotel; need sleep.

2215: Sleep… won't… come…
