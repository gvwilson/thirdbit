Two messages below the announcement that <em>Beautiful Code</em> had won a Jolt award was a rejection notice from Google—it seems that exploring ways to integrate new technologies into software project portals like DrProject, <a href="http://www.sf.net">SourceForge</a>, and <a href="http://code.google.com/hosting/">Google Code</a> "…could not fit any of the research directions that Google is currently exploring".  At least they were only two months late telling me… :-(
