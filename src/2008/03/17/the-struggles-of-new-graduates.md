I had a lot of interesting conversations while at <a href="http://www.cs.duke.edu/sigcse08/">SIGCSE</a> last week, but the best talk I attended was given by Microsoft's <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~abegel/">Andrew Begel</a>, who spent a year studying the problems new college graduates face in their first software development job. The takeaway:
<blockquote> New developers' problems are mainly due to <em>poor communication</em>, not technical skills.</blockquote>
What do new developers do?
<ul>
  <li>Programming (reading &gt;&gt; writing, commenting, proofreading)</li>
  <li>Working on bugs ((repro, reporting, triage) &gt;&gt; debugging)</li>
  <li>Testing (writing, running)</li>
  <li>Revision Control (check in, check out, revert)</li>
  <li>Documentation (reading &gt;&gt; writing, search)</li>
  <li>Specifications (reading &gt;&gt; writing)</li>
  <li>Tools (discovering, finding, installing, using, building)</li>
  <li>Communication (asking questions, persuasion, coordination, email, meetings, meeting prep, finding people, managers, teaching, learning, mentoring)</li>
</ul>
New developers are good at:
<ul>
  <li>Programming</li>
  <li>Design</li>
  <li>Peer mentoring</li>
  <li>Using many strategies when debugging</li>
</ul>
They are bad at:
<ul>
  <li>Engaging a large, legacy codebase without using written docs</li>
  <li>Reproducing bugs</li>
  <li>Using new tools</li>
  <li>Reflecting on their own progress (knowing when they are stuck)</li>
</ul>
They interact naively with other team members when:
<ul>
  <li>Asking questions</li>
  <li>Triaging and resolving bugs</li>
  <li>Attending meetings</li>
</ul>
Beliefs of new developers:
<table class="centered">
<tr>
<td valign="top">Perfectionism</td>
<td valign="top">
<ol>
  <li>I must prove I am smart, productive and write quality code from day 1.</li>
  <li>I must do everything by myself.</li>
  <li>I must fix all bugs I personally find in the code.</li>
  <li><em>Don't ask questions.</em></li>
</ol>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Delusion</td>
<td valign="top">
<ol>
  <li>It compiles, therefore it works. If it has bugs…well, that's what testers are for.</li>
  <li>I know when I get stuck.</li>
</ol>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Self Esteem</td>
<td valign="top">
<ol>
  <li>It can't be the bug repro instructions, it must be me.</li>
  <li>My self-worth is directly related to how much I coded today.</li>
</ol>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
I think this is really valuable work; it'd be great to see it repeated with new grad students…
