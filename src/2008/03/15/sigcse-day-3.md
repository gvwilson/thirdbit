0540: Awake. The city is still outside my window.

0615: Yup, I'm still sick :-(

0730: Bumped into <a href="http://www.se.rit.edu/~sal/">Stephanie Ludi</a> on my way to the conference center. I've borrowed a lot from her <a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~sludi/SEmanual/TableOfContents.html">Student Survival Guide</a> for my software engineering classes; nice to finally meet her in person.

0830: Half of the final exam for CSC301 has been written.

0900: Stephanie's talk on a robotics camp for the visually impaired—looks like it was a lot of fun (and very noisy).

0930: <a href="http://www-sal.cs.uiuc.edu/~kamin/">Sam Kamin</a> (author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Languages-Samuel-N-Kamin/dp/0201068249">my favorite book on programming languages</a>) talking about extensible software for tablet PCs. Every day, I'm more impressed with the quality and passion of the people who've chosen to come to this conference.

1200: The session was called "It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time", and it was pretty funny. Lunch/reception, then it's all over—wish I didn't feel like crap :-(.

1600: Powell's is just as big as I remembered, and just as—I dunno. That many books in one place; where do you start?

1930: Killing time at the hotel—flight isn't for another four hours.

0320 (or 0520, or 0620—take your pick): Why are the TVs in airport waiting lounges so loud? For that matter, why are there TVs there at all?
