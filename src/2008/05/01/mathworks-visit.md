I made a flying visit yesterday to the <a href="http://www.mathworks.com">MathWorks</a> (makers of MATLAB and other fine quantitative programming tools) to give a talk about <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596510046/"><em>Beautiful Code</em></a>. It was a packed house; I'd estimate over 100 people took the time to come and listen to an overview of some of the book's content, and my thoughts on why it's important for us to develop an aesthetics of software. I enjoyed meeting several people I'd only ever corresponded with electronically (one a contributor to BC, the other a co-author on an article ten years ago).  They're doing cool things; I hope we'll be able to find things to do together.
