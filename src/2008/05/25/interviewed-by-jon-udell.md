<a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/">Jon Udell</a> has posted <a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3682.html">an interview he did with me</a> last week at <a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/index.html">IT Conversations</a>. The title is "High Performance Computing Considered Harmful", and <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~gvwilson/articles/hpc-considered-harmful-2008.pdf">slides</a> from a talk of the same name that I gave in Austin are available.

<em>Later: here's <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2008/05/27/a-conversation-with-greg-wilson-about-doing-hpc-right/">Jon's summary of the interview</a>. Curmudgeonly? Moi? :-)</em>
