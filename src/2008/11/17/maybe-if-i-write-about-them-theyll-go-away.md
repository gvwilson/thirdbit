Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sven">Sven Dickinson</a> (acting chair of Computer Science at the University of Toronto) came in to talk to my undergrad software engineering class last Friday about life as a researcher.  He made it sound pretty appealing, but his description of where his time goes made it clearer than ever that one of the reasons I'm <em>not</em> getting much research done is that I'm juggling too many other balls.  This week, for example, I am supposed to:
<ul>
  <li>put together the final pitch to the department for a professional master's in CS</li>
  <li>rearrange three chapters of the "CS-1 in Python" book (which is already up on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Programming-Introduction-Computer-Science/dp/1934356271">Amazon</a>, so we'd better get it finished)</li>
  <li>find projects for the 26 students in my consulting course next term</li>
  <li>write a final exam for the students in this term's course (it's due tomorrow, but that ain't gonna happen)</li>
  <li>find money to keep the rewrite of DrProject on Django going next term</li>
  <li>review a chunk of Flash/Flex code to help a colleague decide whether or not to hire its author</li>
  <li>find (or invent) a coding scheme for scientific disciplines for the <a href="http://softwareresearch.ca/seg/SCS/scientific-computing-survey.html">survey we're running</a></li>
  <li>finish unpacking all the stuff in our new house (top priority: find the power cable for the TV that I so carefully tucked somewhere really clever)</li>
  <li>prep for a recruiting visit next Monday at the <a href="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca">University of Alberta</a></li>
  <li>attend 11 meetings (so far—the number will undoubtedly grow)</li>
</ul>
The irony is, some of my colleagues actually think I'm good at time management and prioritzation…
