## asimpy

`asimpy` is a simple discrete event simulation framework
Unlike its inspiration [SimPy][simpy],
`asimpy` is built on `async` and `await` rather than `yield`,
which makes it easier to model modern asynchronous Python APIs.

## chart_xkcd

## snailz

`snailz` is a synthetic data generator
that models a study of snails in the Pacific Northwest
which are growing to unusual size as a result of exposure to pollution.
The package generates fully-reproducible datasets of varying sizes and with varying statistical properties,
and is intended for classroom use.
For example,
an instructor can give each learner a unique dataset to analyze,
while learners can test their analysis pipelines using datasets they generate themselves.
