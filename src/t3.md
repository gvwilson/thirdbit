We know as much about teaching and learning as we do about public health,
but most people in tech don't even know what we know.
A few basic ideas will help you build more effective lessons in less time and with less effort.
They will also make those lessons easier for people to find and reuse,
and help you figure out what impact they are having.

This one-day workshop introduces key evidence-based teaching techniques
that apply to onboarding new team members, technical support, and self-paced learning
as well as more formal training online or in the classroom.
Topics include:

-   creating learner personas
-   why novices, competent practitioners, and experts need different lessons
-   managing cognitive load
-   formative and summative assessment
-   what motivates and demotivates learners
-   teaching as a performance art

## FAQ

What is the format of the workshop?
:   It can be one full day or two half-days (preferably on consecutive days).
    The latter works better:
    people are less tired for the second half
    and it gives them time to deal with anything else that might come up.
    No special equipment is required.

Is the workshop online or in person?
:   Some parts are more effective (and more fun) in person,
    but it works well online and is often easier to coordinate that way,
    particularly for distributed organizations.
    Online offerings also don't incur travel costs.

How large can a workshop be?
:   Up to 20 people;
    any more than that,
    and people become observers rather than participants.

How much does this cost?
:   Hosts have contributed CAD$1500–4000 for workshops in the past.
    Payment can be made to the instructor,
    but note that if hosts make donations directly
    they receive the charitable tax rebate,
    which can lower the effective overall cost significantly.

How much lead time is needed to arrange a workshop?
:   One workshop was run on 48 hours notice,
    but four weeks notice or more is less stressful for everyone.

Who is the intended audience?
:   Participants at past workshops have included programmers,
    product managers,
    designers,
    data scientists,
    support staff,
    and others.
    The material does not assume any prior training in teaching.

Who can take part?
:   That's up to whoever is organizing or hosting the workshop.
    Most workshops have been for the staff at specific companies,
    but some companies have sponsored workshops
    for members of open source or other volunteer communities.

Where does the material come from?
:   The workshop is a shortened and updated version of
    material originally developed for
    [the Carpentries][carpentries]' instructor training program
    and RStudio's [instructor certification program][rstudio-ed].
