## FAQ

What is the format of the workshop?
:   It can be one full day or two half-days (preferably on consecutive days).
    The latter works better:
    people are less tired for the second half
    and it gives them time to deal with anything else that might come up.
    No special equipment is required.

Is the workshop online or in person?
:   Some parts are more effective (and more fun) in person,
    but it works well online and is often easier to coordinate that way,
    particularly for distributed organizations.
    Online offerings also don't incur travel costs.

How large can a workshop be?
:   Up to 20 people;
    any more than that,
    and people become observers rather than participants.

How much does this cost?
:   The cost depends on the nature of the organization
    and on whether the host is willing to make a donation to a charity
    such as [Rainbow Railroad][rainbow] or the [Red Door Family Shelter][red-door]
    in lieu of part of the fee.
    Please [get in touch][email] to discuss specifics.

Who is the intended audience?
:   Participants at past workshops have included programmers,
    product managers,
    designers,
    data scientists,
    support staff,
    and others.
    The material does not assume any prior training in teaching.

Who can take part?
:   That's up to whoever is organizing or hosting the workshop.
    Most workshops have been for the staff at specific companies,
    but some companies have sponsored workshops
    for members of open source or other volunteer communities.

Where does the material come from?
:   The workshop is a shortened and updated version of
    material originally developed for
    [the Carpentries][carpentries]' instructor training program
    and RStudio's [instructor certification program][rstudio-ed].
