<p>Despite inclement weather, last week's bootcamp at the University of Virginia went well.
According to Steve Crouch,
33 researchers spent two days learning some useful computing skills from Steve,
Carlos Anderson,
and Ben Morris.
Many thanks to Stephen Turner for hosting itâ€“we hope to be back soon.</p>
