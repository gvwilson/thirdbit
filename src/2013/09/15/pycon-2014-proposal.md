<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

<p>Over the last 15 years, Software Carpentry has evolved from a week-long training course at the US national laboratories into a worldwide volunteer effort to raise standards in scientific computing. This talk explains what we have learned along the way the challenges we now face, and our plans for the future. </p>

 <li>Overview</li>
 <li>From Red to Green (or, why our first four attempts failed)</li>

 <li>Small Things Add Up
  <ol>
   <li>live coding</li>
   <li>open everything</li>
   <li>use what we teach</li>
   <li>meet the learners on their own ground</li>
   <li>collaborative note-taking</li>
   <li>sticky notes and minute cards</li>
   <li>pair programming</li>
   <li>keep experimenting</li>
  </ol>
 </li>
 <li>Instructor Training</li>
 <li>TODO
  <ol>
   <li>too slow and too fast</li>
   <li>finances</li>
   <li>long-term assessment</li>
   <li>installation, installation, installation</li>
   <li>teach on the web (and why not)</li>
   <li>what vs. how</li>
   <li>standardization vs. customization</li>
