<p>
  I am pleased to announce that my YA novelette <cite>Still</cite>
  is now available in paperback at Lulu.com
  and as a Kindle e-book on Amazon.com.
  The story is an extended version of one that ran in
  the <a href="http://www.onspec.ca/node/143">Summer 2010 edition of <cite>OnSpec</cite> magazine</a>;
  it deals with some difficult themes,
  but it's the piece of writing I'm proudest of,
  and I hope you enjoy it.
  For more about the book and my other fiction,
