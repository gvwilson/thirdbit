<blockquote>
Every movement that seeks to change society faces two great tasks.
The first is to discredit the old order.
The second is to offer a new one.
Without the assurance of a new order,
the debate becomes a choice between order and chaos,
and order wins.

â€“ William Saletan, in the <em>New York Times Book Review</em>, Sept 26, 2004
