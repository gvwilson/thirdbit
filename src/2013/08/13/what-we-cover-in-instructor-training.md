  The sixth round of our
  online training class for Software Carpentry instructors
  is kicking off this week with 28 participants.
  Our main text is
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Learning-Works-Research-Based-Principles/dp/0470484101/"><cite>How Learning Works</cite></a>,
  an up-to-date summary of research results in educational psychology and instructional design,
  along with the chapter Mark Guzdial wrote for <cite>Making Software</cite>
  explaining why teaching programming is hard.
  Over the next 14 weeks,
  participants will work through both,
  and do the following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Create a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map">concept map</a>
    for a ten-minute lesson of their choosing.
  </li>
  <li>
    Create some assessment questions to distinguish novices from competent practitioners,
    and competent practitioners from experts
    (again, for one small topic).
  </li>
  <li>
    Make a three-minute screencast
    (which always takes a lot longer than people expect),
    and critique an existing screencast.
  </li>
  <li>
    Give someone technical help online
    (e.g., via screen sharing),
    and reflect on how that mode of teaching compares
    to teaching live and to recorded video.
  </li>
  <li>
    Work through our "driver's license" exam
    to demonstrate mastery of core Software Carpentry tools and concepts.
  </li>
  <li>
    Teach a topic at a bootcamp
    and post reflections on how it went.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Participants are sometimes surprised that we spend so little time on the Software Carpentry material,
  and so much on general theory and practice.
  The reason is simple:
  instructors must constantly adapt to new audiences and new needs,
  and knowing the principles behind good teaching is a lot more useful for that
  than intimate familiarity with our lessons on regular expressions.

  The next round of training–our seventh–will start in early October.
