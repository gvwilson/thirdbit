<p>Another day, another flood of defensive, ill-informed commentary on the Internet about women in technology. (I'm thinking particularly of some of the responses to <a href="http://fberriman.com/2013/01/06/conferences-arent-the-problem/">Frances Berriman's post</a> about <a href="http://www.threechords.org/blog/diversity-in-tech-still-an-issue-2013/">Matt Andrews' pointing out</a> that all 22 speakers at the upcoming Edge conference are male, but there's lots more floating around.) So: the claim that "most women just don't like tech" was analyzed ten years ago in Margolis and Fisher's landmark <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unlocking-Clubhouse-Computing-Jane-Margolis/dp/0262632691/"><cite>Unlocking the Clubhouse</cite></a>. The authors (both then at Carnegie-Mellon) found that the "boy's club" atmosphere of tech <em>does</em> discourage women (and others) from taking part. When it was addressed, female enrolment and graduation grew from approximately 12-15% to over 35% in just a few years. It's brief (less than 200 pages), readable, and most importantly, <em>it's based on data</em> rather than anecdote. If the people who keep saying "problem? what problem?" have better data to back up their claims–or any data at all–could they please cite it?</p>
