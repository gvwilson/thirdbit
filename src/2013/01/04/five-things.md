<p>Inspired (as always) by <a href="http://www.geekymomblog.com/2013/01/04/friday-five/">Geeky Mom</a>, here are:</p>
<p><em>Five things I'm thankful for this week:</em></p>
<ol>
  <li>Tobogganing with my daughter (I got to go four times, and I got to be the toboggan on a couple of runs).</li>
  <li>A warm house afterward.</li>
  <li>And warm food.</li>
  <li><a href="http://marvel.com/games/play/29/stark_tower_defense">Stark Tower Defense</a>.</li>
  <li>Public libraries.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Five things I want to do</em></p>
<ol>
  <li>Catch up with Software Carpentry email.</li>
  <li>Take my Australian visitors out for dinner (this will be a lot easier than #1).</li>
  <li>Write my daughter a "science fairies" story. (If I had more time, it'd be a story about a robot fairy princess pirate dinosaur ninja from outer space who plays guitar, but I gotta be realistic hereâ€¦)</li>
  <li>Put together a five-minute talk explaining why a tool to merge PowerPoint slide decks is a key enabler of a better-than-MOOCs future for education.</li>
  <li>Finish reading <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Last-Policeman-Novel-Ben-Winters/dp/1594745765/">The Last Policeman</a></em>.</li>
</ol>
