<p>I finished Ben H. Winters' <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Last-Policeman-A-Novel/dp/1594745765/">The Last Policeman</a></em>; it's one of those "wish I had written it" books. A few passages here and there don't quite ring true, but then you hit things like this:</p>
<blockquote>I was twelve years old and Nico was only six when we moved from the house on Rockland to the farmhouse on Little Pond Road, halfway to Penacook. Nathanael Palace, my grandfather, only recently retired from forty years in banking, had a wide range of interests: model trains, shooting, building stone walls. Already by prepubescence a bookish and private person, I was uninterested to varying degrees in all these activities but was forced by Grandfather to take part. Nico, a lonesome and anxious child, was avidly interested in all of them and rigorously ignored. He once got a set of World War II-era model airplanes, and we sat in the basement, the three of us, and Grandfather harangued me for an hour, refusing to let me quit until I'd successfully attached both wings to the body, while mechanically-minded Nico sat in the corner, clutching a handful of tiny gunmetal gray airplane parts, waiting for her turn: at first excited, then restlessly, and finally in tears.</blockquote>
<p>Very much looking forward to the next two in the planned trilogy.</p>
