The P2PU course I'm leading on <a href="http://p2pu.org/en/groups/how-to-teach-webcraft-and-programming-to-free-range-students/">teaching programming to free-range learners</a>[^1] officially kicked off this week. The first two challenges are up.  <a href="http://p2pu.org/en/groups/how-to-teach-webcraft-and-programming-to-free-range-students/content/getting-started-some-things-to-read-some-things-to-think-about/">First</a>, compare the way you teach (or the way you've been taught) to the research-based best practices in <a href="http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/practiceguide.aspx?sid=1">this IES report</a>.  <a href="http://p2pu.org/en/groups/how-to-teach-webcraft-and-programming-to-free-range-students/content/what-do-you-want-your-learners-to-learn/">Second</a>, describe who you're trying to help. It's already clear that participants are coming at these questions from many different anglesâ€“I'm looking forward to learning more.

[^1]: "Free-range" meaning "anything other than a conventional classroom format". I like the term because it allows us to call people sitting in lecture halls listening to someone talk at the front of the room as "battery-farmed learners".
