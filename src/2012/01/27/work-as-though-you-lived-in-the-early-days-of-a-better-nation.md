Cam Macdonell teaches computer science at Grant MacEwan University in Edmonton. Last September, he had to deliver a software engineering class for the first time. Instead of giving his students the kind of throwaway project such classes are usually built around, he put them to work on Ushahidi, a humanitarian open source project. As <a href="http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2012/01/27/students-learn-programming-with-ushahidi/">his end-of-course blog post</a> shows, they can be proud both of what they did, and how well they did it. Like <a href="https://cs.senecac.on.ca/~david.humphrey/">David Humphrey</a>'s course at Seneca College, or the <a href="http://ucosp.ca/">UCOSP</a> program that gives students from across Canada a chance to work together for course credit, this ought to be part of every undergraduate's education.
