If you want to know why we created <a href="http://aosabook.org"><em>The Architecture of Open Source Applications</em></a> (now in two volumes), you need look no further than the descriptions of other books about software architecture on Amazon. Here's part of the blurb of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/032171833X/">one that appeared last year</a>:

Specifically, the book shows you
<ul>
  <li>What software architecture is about and why your role is vitally important to successful project delivery</li>
  <li>How to determine who is interested in your architecture (your <em>stakeholders</em>), understand what is important to them (their <em>concerns</em>), and design an architecture that reflects and balances their different needs</li>
  <li>How to communicate your architecture to your stakeholders in an understandable way that demonstrates that you have met their concerns (the <em>architectural description</em>)</li>
  <li>How to focus on what is <em>architecturally significant,</em> safely leaving other aspects of the design to your designers, without neglecting issues like performance, resilience, and location</li>
  <li>What important activities you most need to undertake as an architect, such as identifying and engaging stakeholders, using scenarios, creating models, and documenting and validating your architecture</li>
</ul>
Did you notice that "the architecture of 10 (or 20, or 50) actual systems" wasn't on this list?  You won't find that in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Software-Architecture-Foundations-Theory-Practice/dp/0470167742/">this book</a>, either, or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Just-Enough-Software-Architecture-Risk-Driven/dp/0984618104/">this one</a>, or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lean-Architecture-Agile-Software-Development/dp/0470684208/">this one</a>. I haven't read the upcoming third edition of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Software-Architecture-Practice-3rd-Bass/dp/0321815734/">this one</a> yet, but I used to have the first and second on my shelves, and it didn't "show the blueprints" either. If any ambitious grad student is reading this, and looking for a great thesis topic, comparing what software designers <em>actually</em> talk about to what's in the standard textbooks on the subject would, I think, be very interestingâ€¦
