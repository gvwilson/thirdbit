<p>In the latest <a href="http://inscight.org/2012/02/29/episode-25-advanced-school-for-scientific-software-development/">Inscight podcast</a>, the inimitable Katy Huff talks to several of the participants in the bootcamp she and Tommy Guy are leading at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics. It's great to hear so many people from all over the world learning so much.</p>
