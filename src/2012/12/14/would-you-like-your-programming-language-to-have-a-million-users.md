title: "Would You Like Your Programming Language to Have a Million Users?"

<p>Would you like your new programming language to have a million users in a couple of years? You would? Cool–here's how to do it. Instead of asking yourself, "How will people write loops?" or, "Is this statically or dynamically typed?", ask yourself, "What can I do <em>in the language</em> to make packaging and installation a zillion times easier?" Because that's the biggest headache most people have these days: getting a thousand and one bits of code to install on their machine and play nicely once they're there.</p>
<p>This is why I find <a href="http://julialang.org/">Julia</a> uninteresting, and why I think we'd be further ahead if the effort that was put into Python 3 had been put into rationalizing the standard library and sorting out P&amp;I. I don't know a single person who switched to Python because of the improvements in 3.*, but I know a lot who would trade their eyeteeth for a P&amp;I system that just plain worked. Similarly, I don't see a single feature in Julia that's expressly designed to make P&amp;I easier, which means I don't see any reason to get excited about it. I'd be interested in pointers to languages and systems that do a significantly better job…</p>
