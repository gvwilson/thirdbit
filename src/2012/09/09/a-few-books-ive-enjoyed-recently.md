The first of Philip Reeve's prequels to the "Hungry Cities" books for young adults is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fever-Crumb-Philip-Reeve/dp/054522215X/"><em>Fever Crumb</em></a>; the same would also enjoy Ian McDonald's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Planesrunner-Everness-Book-One-McDonald/dp/1616145412/"><em>Planesrunner</em></a>. The Chris Wooding "Tales of the Ketty Jay" series (steampunk Firefly, kind of) starts with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Retribution-Falls-Chris-Wooding/dp/0345522516/"><em>Retribution Falls</em></a>, and the most recent of the Joe Abercrombie books is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Heroes-Joe-Abercrombie/dp/0316193569/"><em>The Heroes</em></a>. We also liked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ex-Heroes-Peter-Clines/dp/1934861286/"><em>Ex-Heroes</em></a>, a superheroes-vs-zombies story, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bitter-Seeds-Ian-Tregillis/dp/0765361205/"><em>Bitter Seeds</em></a>. I really liked Felix Gilman's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thunderer-Felix-Gilman/dp/055359110X/"><em>Thunderer</em></a>, but found the sequel slow and complicated; <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Half-Made-World-Felix-Gilman/dp/0765325535/">The Half-Made World</a></em> (same author) was another good read, but the sequel isn't out yet. Wouldn't recommend Grossman's <em>The Magicians</em> unless you like whiny, self-pitying protagonists; Bacigalupi's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Windup-Girl-Paolo-Bacigalupi/dp/1597801585/"><em>The Windup Girl</em></a>, Hugh Howey's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wool-Omnibus-Edition-Hugh-Howey/dp/1469984202/"><em>Wool</em></a>, and Ian McDonald's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Dervish-House-Ian-McDonald/dp/1616145455/"><em>The Dervish House</em></a> are all much better reads.
