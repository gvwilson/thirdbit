<p>I've been reading <a href="http://www.beneath-ceaseless-skies.com/"><em>Beneath Ceaseless Skies</em></a>, an online SF&amp;fantasy magazine, for about a year now. Most of the stories are pretty good, but there's a sameness to their style that's starting to weary me: they all feel as if they were written on a drizzly Sunday afternoon by someone who would really rather be penning paeans to J.D.Salinger for the <em>New Yorker</em>. Meanwhile, Michael Chabon (a one-time darling of that set) is now writing <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401729/">the kind of kapow! adventure story</a> that was, for many decades, the mainstay of SF&amp;fantasy.</p>
<p>Just sayin'â€¦</p>
