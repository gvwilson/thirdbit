The slides from my keynote today at <a href="http://msrcanada.org/msrvision2020/">MSR Vision 2020</a> are now <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/gvwilson/two-solitudes">available on Slideshare</a>. Long story short, I proposed that the only way to improve communication between researchers and practitioners in software engineering is to create an empirical, evidence-based course in software engineering (with assignments and exams that require students to analyze code and data themselves, do grounded theory analysis of interviews, etc., so that they understand how these studies actually work and what questions they can and can't say), and then wait ten years for those students to become team leads and managers.

<em>Later: the slides are being <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/yw9ra/greg_wilsons_brilliant_slides_about_the/">discussed on Reddit</a>. Cool!</em>
