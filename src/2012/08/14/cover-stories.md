I told someone earlier today that I don't miss academia, but I do miss teaching. Upon reflection, though, that's not quite true. The ache I feel when I think about my experiences as a prof is the same ache I feel when I listen to a song that has a great chorus but lousy verses, or watch <em>Return of the Jedi</em>. It's the ache of fumbled opportunity, the feeling that this could have been great–really great–if only it had been done right. And I wonder if that's what really drives some of the people who are trying to reinvent education today. What they really want, deep down, is a clean slate; the web and everything else is just their cover story.
