title: "Is This Really Necessary?"

<p>I was very excited by today's announcement that <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/introducing-khan-cs/">the Khan Academy is going to start offering programming courses</a>–until I read the whole post. I'm not a fan of today's universities, but this is an undeserved smear:</p>
<blockquote>The desire to learn and understand can be a powerful accelerant for students and it's something that <em>is completely missing from almost all Computer Science education</em>.</blockquote>
<p>I'd <em>really</em> like to see the data behind that claim, but I strongly suspect there isn't any.  I also have some serious reservations about this:</p>
<blockquote>I think that JavaScript, and specifically learning how to code in-browser, is inherently a better way of learning. Reducing the complexity of getting started down to zero will result in more people learning. Additionally the ubiquity of JavaScript only serves to educate people in a language that will be generally useful.</blockquote>
<p>Possibly. On the other hand, JavaScript has a lot of gotchas–more, I believe, than Python, Scheme, or Logo [1]. Have they done any work to find out whether JavaScript's ubiquity and being able to code without installing anything on the desktop outweighs that complexity?  Again, I strongly suspect the answer is "no".</p>
<p>Long story short, <a href="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/?p=14804">what KA is doing is genuinely cool</a>. I just think it would be cooler without the spin.</p>
<p>[1] Ironically, John Resig is famous in part for creating a library to hide some of those gotchas from run-of-the-mill developers (like me).</p>
