<p>One of the last things I did before leaving the University of Toronto was start <a href="http://ucosp.ca/">UCOSP</a>, which gives students in CS a chance to work in cross-country teams on open source capstone projects. I learned recently from <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~reid/">Karen Reid</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~mcraig/">Michelle Craig</a> that it has grown considerably: 20 different Canadian schools are involved in the 2012-13 academic year, and next term, the list will also include Stanford, MIT, University of Texas, Cornell, University of Singapore, University of Tokyo, University of Sichuan, University of Helsinki, Tampere Univ of Tech, Imperial College of London, and Jagiellonian University. Kudos to the organizers: it's great to see it thriving.</p>
