<p>One of our key deliverables for the Sloan Foundation-funded work is a badging program built on top of Mozilla's <a href="http://openbadges.org/">Open Badges Initiative</a>. Riffing on our new logo, Carri Han has designed three badges for us:</p>
<table class="centered">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img src="@root/files/2012/02/learner.png" class="centered"></td>
<td>for people who have mastered our core content</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="@root/files/2012/02/organizer.png" class="centered"></td>
<td>for people who have organized and run workshops</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="@root/files/2012/02/creator.png" class="centered"></td>
<td>for people who have created content</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Please let us know what you think.</p>
