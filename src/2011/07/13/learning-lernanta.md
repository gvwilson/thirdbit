<a href="https://github.com/p2pu/lernanta/wiki">Lernanta</a> is the web application that powers <a href="http://p2pu.org">p2pu.org</a>, the peer-to-peer university project backed by Mozilla. On Saturday, July 23, Zuzel Vera Pacheco (its lead developer) and I will be running a one-day code-in for people who'd like to get up to speed with it, and with all the nifty things it's built on top of: <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>, and more.  (Note: I sort of know a bit about Django, but I'm a jQuery and GitHub newbie, so I'll be asking questions, not answering themâ€¦)  The venue is still to be determined, but will be somewhere in downtown Toronto.  Attendance is free, but some prior experience with Python web programming is a must.  If you're interested, please <a href="mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com">email me</a>.
