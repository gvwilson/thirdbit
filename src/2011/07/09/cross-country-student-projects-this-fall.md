<a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~reid">Karen Reid</a> has <a href="http://ucosp.ca/2009-2010/uncategorized/2011/07/2815/">posted some news</a> about this fall's cross-country undergrad capstone open source projects (now you see why we call it "UCOSP").  Google has once again agreed to be the program's major sponsor, and Waterloo's <a href="http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~rtholmes/">Reid Holmes</a> has joined Karen, <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~mcraig/">Michelle Craig</a>, and Alberta's <a href="http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~stroulia/">Eleni Stroulia</a> on the steering committee.  It promises to be another great term.
