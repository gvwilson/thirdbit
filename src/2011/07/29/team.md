It's just a week 'til the first Ladies Learning Code workshop in Toronto, and the <a href="http://heatherpayne.ca/so-who%E2%80%99s-instructing-the-first-ever-ladies-learning-code-workshop">list of instructors</a> is pretty impressive.  Thanks in advance to:
<ul>
  <li>Pearl Chen</li>
  <li>Crystal Preston-Watson</li>
  <li>Mike Conley</li>
  <li>Gavin Lobo</li>
  <li>Jay Goldman</li>
  <li>Phyliss Lee</li>
  <li>Christina Truong</li>
  <li>Laurie MacDougall Sookraj</li>
  <li>Svetiana Kolupaeva</li>
  <li>Monika Piotrowicz</li>
  <li>Melissa Luu</li>
  <li>Emir Hasanbegovic</li>
  <li>John Lim</li>
</ul>
and of course to Heather Payne, Amrita Mathur, and everyone else who pulled it together.  W00t!

On the same day (August 6), a much smaller group will be having a learn-in at Mozilla's Toronto offices, where Zuzel Vera will get us up to speed with Lernanta development.  If you're interested in Python web programming, Django, and online education, there's still space to join us, and you can <a href="http://www.meetup.com/p2pu/Toronto-CA/149821/">sign up online</a>.
