I'm three weeks into 2011, and two weeks behind on everything. Where <em>does</em> the time go?
<ol>
  <li>I'm supposed to be working full-time on Software Carpentry, but between Jon Udell's visit, the architecture book (#2 below), and trying to help the professional master's students find internships (#3), I only booked 19 hours last week. Most of that was spent trying to raise more money, and trying to get people to contribute content. I did get some of the high-performance computing lecture drafted, though, thanks to help from <a href="http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~ljdursi/">Jonathan Dursi</a> and <a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/apetersen/">Andrew Petersen</a>, and I hope to post the first couple of episodes this week.</li>
  <li><a href="http://aosabook.org"><em>The Architecture of Open Source Applications</em></a> is winding down, but there's still a lot of editing to do, and several contributors to chase up (if only to confirm that they're not actually going to contribute).</li>
  <li>Last fall, the University of Toronto launched a new <a href="http://web.cs.toronto.edu/program/grad/mscac.htm">M.Sc. in Applied Computing</a>. I finally got to meet the first six students a week and a half ago; they're an impressive bunch, but I was dismayed to discover that no one had done anything about lining up the eight-month internships that are supposed to be the core of their degree. I'll post again soon with a longer description of who they are and how they can help move new ideas and technology from academia into the real world.</li>
  <li>Ellen Hsiang has finished storyboarding the artwork for <em>And Thenâ€¦</em>, a children's book about the history of, well, just about everything. We hope to have a draft of the book on the web in about a month.</li>
</ol>
Tomorrow's another Monday; let's see if the week coming up is more productive (sorry, if <em>I'm</em> more productive) than the three gone by.
