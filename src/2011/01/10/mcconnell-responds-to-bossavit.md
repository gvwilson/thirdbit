Laurent Bossavit recently posted a critique of Steve McConnell's chapter in <em>Making Software</em> on productivity differences between programmers (<a href="http://blog.institut-agile.fr/2010/11/folklore-ou-fait-scientifique-comment.html">French original here</a>, <a href="http://morendil.github.com/folklore.html">English translation here</a>). In response, Steve posted <a href="http://forums.construx.com/blogs/stevemcc/archive/2011/01/09/origins-of-10x-how-valid-is-the-underlying-research.aspx">this article</a> that explains how he came to this topic when writing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670"><em>Code Complete</em></a>, and then goes through the research he cited in his chapter, correcting the mistakes in Bossavits' critique point by patient point. I think Steve has actually read the literature his claims are based on (Bossavits admits in several places that he hasn't), and there are no drive-by <em>ad hominem</em> attacksâ€“in short, his post is a great example of how this discussion <em>should</em> be conducted.
