<a href="http://streetknit.ca/?p=120">StreetKnit</a>, a charity that collects knitted goods for the homeless, will be on Canada AM this coming Monday (January 31). I'm looking forward to Maddie seeing her mummy on TV!

<em>Update: Sadie's interview has been moved to Thursday because of events in Egypt.</em>
