Two people asked me "how are things?" this morning just a few seconds apart.  My answer is, "I need a job, my sister has two months (maybe three), and we're about to  re-elect a cold-hearted control freak because progressive forces in this  country have run out of steam.  But all three of my current book  projects are moving forward, I woke up beside my wife and daughter this  morning, and we get to have elections as often as we want." As Facebook  says, "It's complicated."
