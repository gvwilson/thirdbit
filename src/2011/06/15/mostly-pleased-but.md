title: "Mostly Pleased, But…"

We have started recruiting for the second volume of <em>The Architecture of Open Source Applications</em>, and while I'm mostly pleased with how it's going, there's one glaring problem.  Here's how the three collections I've edited in the past five years have broken down:
<table class="centered">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Title</th>
<th>Female</th>
<th>Male</th>
<th>% Female</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><cite>Beautiful Code</cite></td>
<td style="text-align: right;">1</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">35</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">2.7%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><cite>Making Software</cite></td>
<td style="text-align: right;">9</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">34</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">21%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><cite>AOSA 1</cite></td>
<td style="text-align: right;">8</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">33</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">19.5%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><cite>AOSA 2</cite></td>
<td style="text-align: right;">1</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">20</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">4.7%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Ouch–I was very pleased that <em>MS</em> and <em>AOSA 1</em> weren't as bad as <em>BC</em>, but right now, <em>AOSA 2</em> isn't where I'd like it to.  Its contributors also almost all speak English as a first language, which isn't representative of all the great open source work being done elsewhere.  We'd welcome help addressing both problems…
