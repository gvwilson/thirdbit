Thanks to heroic effort from Ian McDowell and <a href="http://arbrown.ca/">Amy Brown</a>, <a href="http://aosabook.org"><em>The Architecture of Open Source Applications</em></a> is now <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Architecture-Open-Source-Applications-ebook/dp/B00557TMN4/">available for the Kindle</a> at Amazon.com for $9.99. As always, all royalties (well, all the royalties Amazon doesn't gobble up) will go directly to <a href="http://amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a>. Now, who'd like to help us produce a professional-looking e-pub edition?
