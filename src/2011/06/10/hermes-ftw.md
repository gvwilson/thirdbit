A lot of work got done on a lot of great projects at last weekend's <a href="http://www.rhok.org/">Random Hacks of Kindness</a>; one of the most exciting was the Hermes Message Carrier, an ad hoc store-and-forward way to get messages out of areas that have gone dark after disasters by swapping them between mobile devices until one of those devices gets back into the light.
