In all the excitement, I forgot to mention that I started a new job three weeks ago: I'm now working for <a href="http://sidefx.com">Side Effects Software</a>, makers of a world-class visual effects tool called Houdini. It's been fun so farâ€“I'm learning lots (you can tell because I occasionally use language that's not suitable for home).
