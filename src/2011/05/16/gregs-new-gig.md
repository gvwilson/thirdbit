I enjoyed working on Software Carpentry last year, but money for a second year failed to materialize, and after seven years doing other things, it felt like it was time to get back to building software for a living.  I am therefore now working at <a href="http://www.sidefx.com">Side Effects</a>, which makes special effects software for the game and movie industries.  I'm finally learning Javascript, and will be working alongside two of the students from the <a href="http://web.cs.toronto.edu/program/grad/mscac.htm">Professional Master's program</a> I helped create while I was at the University of Toronto. And I have a <em>great</em> view straight up University Avenueâ€¦
