title: "An Easy Place to Start: Systems Programming"
---
<p>As a follow-up to recent posts on how to contribute, what better looks like, and Elango Cheran's secure shell episode, here's a specific request: we would like three episodes on systems programming, by which we mean writing programs to:</p>
<ul>
<li>manipulate files and directories (chdir, stat, etc.)</li>
<li>working with archives (tar, zip, etc.)</li>
<li>run other programs (the subprocess module in all its fearsome glory)</li>
</ul>
<p>A typical use case is writing a Python script to run a compiled legacy application a few hundred times for slightly different parameter values, putting each run's output in a separate directory that's created on the fly, and so on.  If you're interested, please get in touch â€“ it's easier than you think.</p>
