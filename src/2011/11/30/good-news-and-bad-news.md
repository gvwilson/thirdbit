The good news is, the Khan Academy has finally added some <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/#computer-science">lectures on programming</a>. The bad news is, the lectures build toward Fibonacci sequences and sorting, rather than things most people will actually want to do.  As <a href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/">Mark Guzdial</a> and others have showed through initiatives like Media Computing, you can introduce all the usual suspects (assignment, iteration, conditionals, etc.) in the context of something like image manipulation, but doing so yields higher retention, particularly among the 85% or so of the population that isn't turned on by abstract symbol manipulation.
