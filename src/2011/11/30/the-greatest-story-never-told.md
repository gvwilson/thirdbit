A good TV drama needs heroes and villains, romance, momentum, crackling dialog, and the occasional chase scene (gunplay optional). Which makes me wonder: why hasn't anyone ever built a series around the Underground Railroad? There were plenty of heroes, and even more villains; it's got all the high moral drama you could ever want, and thrills? Just read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bound-Canaan-Underground-Railro-ebook/dp/B000WCWV08/"><em>Bound for Canaan</em></a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beyond-the-River-ebook/dp/B0036QVP4U/"><em>Beyond the River</em></a> if you want thrills. If Vince Gilligan is looking for something to do after <em>Breaking Bad</em>, I for one would pre-order the boxed set.
