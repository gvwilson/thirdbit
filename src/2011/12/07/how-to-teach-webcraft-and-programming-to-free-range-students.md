title: "How to Teach Webcraft and Programming to Free-Range Students"

I will be running a <a href="http://p2pu.org">P2PU</a> course starting in January on teaching free-range learners how to program and build stuff on the web. The blurb is below; anyone who wants to can sign up to follow along or take part (we expect it will require 3-4 hours/week from mid-January to some time in April). I'm not an expert on these subjects by any means, but I've learned a few things from running Software Carpentry that I think are worth sharing, and hope that this course will give me a chance to learn more.  (Note that I'm primarily interested in how to teach adults outside traditional classroom settings, so that will be the course's initial focus, but its long-term direction will depend on the interests of participants.)

<em>What do we know about how novices learn webcraft and programming, why do we believe it, and how can we apply that knowledge to free-range learners?</em>

Right now, people all over the world are learning how to write programs and create web sites, but or every one who is doing it in a classroom there are a dozen free-range learners. This group will focus on how we, as mentors, can best help them. Topics will include:
<ul>
  <li>What does research tell us about how people learn?</li>
  <li>Why are the demographics of programming so unbalanced?</li>
  <li>What best practices in instructional design are relevant to free-range learners?</li>
  <li>What skills do people need in order to bake their own web?</li>
  <li>How are grassroots groups trying to teach these things now?</li>
  <li>What's working and what isn't?</li>
</ul>
