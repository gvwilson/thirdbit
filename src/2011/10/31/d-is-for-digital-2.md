Brian Kernighan's new book <a href="http://kernighan.com/"><em>D is for Digital</em></a> has arrived. As the subtitle says, it is, "What a well-informed person ought to know  about computers and communications" (sort of like "Physics for presidents"). As you'd expect, the writing is crisp and clean; my only complaint is that it isn't longer.
