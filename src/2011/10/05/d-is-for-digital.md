Brian Kernighan, whose books on C, Unix, and programming design shaped the thinking of an entire generation of software developers, has a new book out called <a href="https://www.createspace.com/3654536"><em>D Is For Digital: What a well-informed person should know about computers and communications</em></a>. I've spent 20 years trying to write like him; very excited to get my copy. Equally excited that he has gone with a print-on-demand publisher rather than one of the big players: it's a sign of the timesâ€¦
