To whom it may concern,
I was very disappointed to hear that you have decided to deny Fauja Singh the record for being the world's oldest marathon runner[^1].  His age is well enough documented to satisfy the British Home Office (grantors of his passport)—surely that is as reliable as anything else he could produce?  On behalf of everyone inspired by his courage and determination, I ask you to reconsider.

Sincerely,
Dr. Gregory V. Wilson
