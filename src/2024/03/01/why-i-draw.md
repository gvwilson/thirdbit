title: "Why I Draw"

People ask me why I draw diagrams by hand and then complain about not being able to diff and merge SVGs in version control.
Well, I drew this diagram for [the SQL tutorial][sql-tutorial] I've been working on using [draw.io][drawio]:

<img src="@root/files/2024/select_draw_io.svg" alt="draw.io diagram" class="center" width="800px">

Here it is in [graphviz][graphviz]:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-8">
    <img src="@root/files/2024/select_graphviz.svg" alt="graphviz diagram" class="center" width="600px">
  </div>
  <div class="col-4">
<pre style="font-size: small;">
digraph select {
  "select" -> "chooses";
  "chooses" -> "rows";
  "chooses" -> "columns";
  "columns" -> "specified by";
  "specified by" -> "names";
  "specified by" -> "calculations";
  "specified by" -> "* (for all)";
  "columns" -> "from";
  "rows" -> "from";
  "from" -> "table";
  "table" -> "identified by";
  "identified by" -> "name";
  "rows" -> "can be paged with";
  "rows" -> "can be filtered by";
  "can be paged with" -> "limit";
  "can be paged with" -> "offset";
  "can be filtered by" -> "condition";
  "condition" -> "evaluated for each";
  "evaluated for each" -> "rows";
  "condition" -> "must be";
  "must be" -> "Boolean";
  "select" [shape=box];
  "rows" [shape=box];
  "columns" [shape=box];
  "names" [shape=box];
  "calculations" [shape=box];
  "* (for all)" [shape=box];
  "table" [shape=box];
  "name" [shape=box];
  "limit" [shape=box];
  "offset" [shape=box];
  "condition" [shape=box];
  "Boolean" [shape=box];
}
</pre>
  </div>
</div>

and in [Mermaid][mermaid]:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-8">
    <img src="@root/files/2024/select_mermaid.svg" alt="mermaid diagram" class="center" width="600px">
  </div>
  <div class="col-4">
<pre style="font-size: small;">

Never mind the layout of the graphviz and Mermaid diagrams
or how much manual tweaking would be required to get them to be more compact;
I simply don't believe that diffing and merging the text used to generate them
would be any easier than diffing and merging SVG.
Whoever adds a real diagram editor to their computational notebook
and provides a semantic (visual) way to diff changes to diagrams
is going to clean houseâ€¦
