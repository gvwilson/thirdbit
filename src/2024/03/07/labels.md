I use the labels shown below for programming book projects hosted on GitHub;
they're a bit different from those I use for pure programming projects.

| Name | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| contribute-addition | A pull request that adds new content |
| contribute-change | A pull request that changes existing content |
| contribute-fix | A pull request that fixes a mistake in existing content |
| discuss | An issue or PR currently being discussed |
| governance | Project governance (typically issues that eventually come to a vote) |
| help-wanted | A request for assistance |
| in-content | Is the issue in lesson content? |
| in-infrastructure | Is the issue in infrastructure? |
| is-complete | Marks a PR or issue that has been finished |
| is-declined | Marks a PR or issue that isn't going to be merged or addressed |
| is-duplicate | Marks a PR or issue that duplicates existing work |
| propose-addition | A suggestion for an addition to content or infrastructure |
| propose-change | A suggestion for a change to content or infrastructure |
| report-bug | A report that something is wrong with content or infrastructure |
