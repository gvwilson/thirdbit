title: "Thinking About Lessons"

I'm helping a group of programmers put a book together,
so it feels like a good time to revisit the differences between different kinds of lessons.
The classification starts by categorizing stages in learning as:

1.  *Unconscious incompetence:*
    the person doesn't know what they don't know.

2.  *Conscious incompetence:*
    the person is aware that they don't know things.

3.  *Conscious competence:*
    the person knows how to do something if they focus on doing it.

4.  *Unconscious competence:*
    the person can do things well without having to think them through each time.

This scheme explains why different people need different learning materials:

1.  The first and most important requirement is
    to get people from not knowing what they don't know
    to knowing what they should learn
    *and wanting to learn it*.
    Intrinsic motivation is the single strongest predictor of learning in neurotypical adults,
    but it's far too easy for traditional classroom-style lectures to *demotivate* people
    by intimidating them or making them feel that they don't belong.
    The first "lesson" should therefore make people welcome
    and convince them that they *can* learn this stuff
    and that doing so will be useful.

2.  The next step is a tutorial,
    i.e.,
    a guided tour of key concepts and ways to use them.
    It's tempting to throw learners straight into projects
    or set them goals and ask them to explore solutions on their own,
    but at this stage in their development,
    most people don't know what questions to ask
    or how to recognize a useful answer when they stumble over one.
    A good learning designer will focus on helping learners construct a mental model
    so that they have somewhere to put their knowledge;
    the two key questions here are,
    "How *little* can I teach?" and
    "How can learners check that they've actually understood?"

3.  Once people have a working mental model of the problem domain
    they are able to start exploring on their own.
    At this point,
    teaching shifts from "push" (i.e., "I know you need to know this next")
    to "pull" (i.e., "Come to me when there's something you can't figure out on your own").
    How-to material like reference manuals, Q&A sites, and online forums
    are more useful at this stage than lessons:
    as I've said [elsewhere][t3],
    if the instructor keeps pushing after learners are ready to explore
    then learners will be frustrated because things are moving too slowly,
    but if instructors shift to "push" too early
    then learners will be frustrated because they feel lost.

4.  Most people stop at conscious competence in most learning domains:
    they become good enough at driving, cooking, or HTML
    to get across town,
    make dinner,
    or fix a web page.
    To go further requires *reflective practice*:
    the person must try new things and reflect on what worked, what didn't, and why.
    That reflection is much more productive when done with partners,
    so demos, code reviews, master classes, and whiteboarding sessions
    should take the place of [lessons like this][sql-tutorial] or [Stack Overflow][so].

5.  The final arrow in the diagram above is labelled "humility"
    because that's what experts need
    to go back to being consciously incompetent in a new domain.
    This is often the hardest step of all:
    after spending years becoming an expert in high-performance computing
    or instructional design,
    it's hard for someone to admit that they don't know anything about
    the psychology of programming
    or the hundred ways in which an interview process can be biased.
    It's the work of a lifetime,
    but learning to bite one's tongue
    is a small price to pay
    for the excitement of everything feeling new again.
