A week ago I posted [my last to-don't list][to-dont];
here's what I'm working on instead:

-   A [SQL tutorial][sql-tutorial]:
    no idea when I'm going to teach it or to whom,
    but a couple of hundred people are viewing it every day.

-   A [tutorial on systems programming for data scientist][sys-tutorial].
    I have even less idea who this is for,
    but I'm learning some useful things as I work on it.

-   A sequel to the *Software Design by Example* books in [JavaScript][sdxjs] and [Python][sdxpy]
    in a pure functional language called [Roc][roc].
    I've nibbled at functional programming in the past;
    if I'm ever going to make a meal of it,
    I'd better get started.

-   I probably won't do more work on [*Research Software Design by Example*][rsdx]
    unless I find a co-author.

-   A YA novel about [a girl living in Antarctica][iffy].
    At one point it was nearly 70,000 words long (against a target of 90,000),
    but I've torn off the back half and am slowly rebuilding it.
    It helps to have a [regular reader][yanina]â€¦

-   A middle-school story about [all the other Santas][santas].
    It's currently 28,000 words long (against a target of 32,000),
    but I had no idea how to end it,
    so I've set it aside for now.

-   Another middle-school story about [kangaroos and robots][maddy-roo].
    I'm posting a couple or three chapters a week to [Scribophile][scribophile],
    and hope to rewrite it over the summer based on that feedback.

-   Running the occasional workshop on [how to teach][t3]
    to raise money for [Rainbow Railroad][rr].
    We still don't know when [the person we're sponsoring][rr-sponsor]
    will be able to come to Canada,
    but we look forward to meeting her.

-   Physiotherapy for my left wrist,
    which I've damaged by typing too much on crappy laptop keyboards.
    I expect to get most function back,
    but it's the end of my music-playing days.
