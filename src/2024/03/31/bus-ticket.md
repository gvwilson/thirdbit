It's December 4, 1982.
I'm eighteen years old
and I'm standing in the bus station in Belleville, Ontario
as my bus pulls awayâ€¦

I was on my way back from a visit to Toronto.
Nothing had gone as planned.
In fact,
things had gone so badly that I got off in Belleville to call home (collect)
because I needed to hear a friendly voice.
I didn't realize my bus was leaving until I saw it turn out of the parking lot
and onto the highway.
My bag was on board;
so were my winter coat and my wallet.
I had a couple of bucks in my pocket,
the clothes on my back,
and no idea how I was going to get back to Kingston.

I'm pretty sure I started to cry.
I don't actually remember if I did or not,
but I do remember feeling like a complete loser.

I went to the counter and explained my situation to the woman selling tickets.
She was sympathetic,
but said there was nothing she could do,
so I sat down on a bench and tried to figure out what to do.
I could call my parents again,
but what could they do from several thousand kilometers away?

And then a guy I'd never met before
came over and handed me a one-way ticket to Kingston he had just bought for me
and said, "Don't screw this up."
He walked away and got in a cab before I could thank him or say that I didn't want charity
(although right then I really, really did).

I have no idea who he was,
and as far as I know,
I've never seen him since.
I can't even really remember his face any more,
but in a way I think I've spent a lot of the last forty years trying to pay him back.

Time to make another cup of tea.
If you came in peace, be welcome;
if not, be damned with you.
