From 2011 to 2023,
[*It Will Never Work in Theory*][nwit] tried to bridge the gulf between theory and practice in software engineering
by publishing short summaries of empirical software engineering research and hosting talks by their authors.
Our [post-mortem][postmortem] describes that effort and analyzes its failure;
[this page][nwit-page] reprints very short summaries I've posted on Mastodon since NWIT shut down.
I will update it sporadically;
each time I do,
I will dream of a world in which every undergraduate software engineering student
is taught how to do studies like these
so that they can evaluate and apply these findings.
