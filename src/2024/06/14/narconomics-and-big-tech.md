I really enjoyed Wainwright's *[Narconomics][narconomics]*,
which explores the economics of the illegal drug trade.
It turns out that (for example) HR is more of a problem than you'd think:
good accountants know they can actually make more money on Wall Street where crime is legal.
Marketing, dispute resolution, quality control: it's a very fun read.
But it sparked a thought:
I think a book comparing Big Tech to drug cartels would be awesome.
Both make money from selling addictive products and shrugging off externalities;
both needed new offerings to bring in new revenue (AI is to Google what meth was to the Juarez cartel);
both regard the legal system as merely an operating cost;
and both tend to be run by egomaniacal sociopaths.
(I expect Musk and Escobar would have gotten on well.)
If I knew enough, I'd start writing today;
if you do, please start writing tomorrow.
