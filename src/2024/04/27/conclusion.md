[Consider the bicycle][sdxpy_finale]:
more specifically,
the De Rosa SK Pininfarina.
I think it's beautiful,
but I wouldn't call it art,
because being beautiful isn't its primary purpose.
It was created to be useful;
the fact that it can also be appreciated aesthetically is an intentional bonus.

Now think about your favorite pieces of software.
We routinely critique their interfaces by asking:

- Does it do what it's supposed to?

- Is it pleasurable to use?

What's missing is the third leg of the industrial design tripod:

- Did its design facilitate its manufacture and maintenance?

At a deeper level,
what's *really* missing is a shared vocabulary
and a suite of canonical examples
that would give us a basis for critiquing software
in the way that we can a train or a sofa.
We use words like "elegant" when referring to Unix's pipe-and-filter model,
but when asked to explain,
we run out of meaning long before any reasonably intelligent industrial designer
runs out of things to say about the design of a toenail clipper.

In retrospect this is what I have been groping toward for the last twenty-five years.
I haven't succeeded,
but I hope this book will help us get a little closer.
I hope that some day we'll be able to talk meaningfully about the beauty of software,
because it *is* beautiful and we deserve to have ways to say that.
Until then:
