Having shown learners how to [transfer files][sdxpy_ftp] over TCP,
the next step is to explain how an HTTP server works,
which is what [Chapter 22: Serving Web Pages][sdxpy_http] does.
The full story would fill several books,
so I focused on the fact that requests and responses are just formatted text
and on how to test a web server.

Looking at the material now,
I regret that I didn't devote a chapter to authentication.
I had [a bruising encounter with certificates][certificates] last month
that left me believing there's a need for a scale-model tutorial of how they work,
but while a bunch of people wanted to *read* a book on [security by example][votes_are_in],
nobody wanted to help *write* it.
I suppose there's always the next lifeâ€¦
