I had to learn almost as much to write [Chapter 20: A Package Manager][sdxpy_pack]
as I did to write [the chapter on databases][sdxpy_db].
Recursively enumerating all possible combinations of packages
to find ones that were compatible with each other
was relatively straightforward
(by which I mean that
someone taught me how to do it so long ago
that it seems like I've always known).
Using a theorem prover to do this more efficiently,
on the other hand,
was brand new.
(I worked on a theorem prover for modal logics for my master's degree,
but it used a completely different approach and that was thirty-nine years ago.)
I almost gave up on [Z3][z3] several times—its documenation is terrible—but
then I stumbled across [this talk by Andreas Zeller][zeller_talk]
and things started to make sense.
I don't know if my exposition does the subject justice,
but I'm grateful to have had an excuse to dive into it.
