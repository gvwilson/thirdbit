This is not a molecule of acetone:

It's not even an accurate representation of a molecule of acetone:
atoms are not little colored balls,
and the bonds between them are not little sticks.
However,
you can explain most practical chemistry using the ball-and-stick model.
More importantly,
if you insist that ten-year-olds have to start with electron shells and quantum chemistry
because they're "real",
I don't think you're really interested in teaching them.
Whether you acknowledge it or not,
what you're doing is gatekeeping.

Over the past six months I have tried and failed to get into
several books on ethics in tech,
psychological safety,
the governance of open source projects,
and similar topics that I think are really important in software engineering.
In each case I felt the author was expecting me to dive straight into quantum mechanics.
In particular,
the (many, repeated) off-hand references to work I'd never heard of
made me feel like a ten-year-old encountering "basic" trigonometry.

I'd have no grounds for complaint if these books were intended for a scholarly audience:
I don't expect someone who has never programmed
to understand type theory without doing a lot of preparatory work,
so it would be narcissistic to expect advanced topics in other people's disciplines
to be instantly accessible to me
just because I can code.
But the authors of these books clearly thought they were writing for a wider audienceâ€”for
people in tech who wanted to get into ethics, political theory, or group psychology.
They just missed the mark
in the way that I once missed the mark by insisting on explaining hash tables
to a room full of biologists
in their first lesson on Python
because hey,
how can you possibly use dictionaries without understanding how they work?

I think it *is* possible to write about these things at the ball-and-stick level.
I also think that people who do so
probably encounter the same sniffy reaction from their peers
that I did in the early days of Software Carpentry
(which a senior professor in computer science once dismissed as "merely useful").
If you have favorite examples to share,
I'd enjoy hearing from you.
