title: "Software Design by Example in Python 13: A Code Linter"

The [HTML validator example][sdxpy_check] in Chapter 11 has two natural follow-ons.
the [template expander][sdxpy_template] of Chapter 12
(discussed [yesterday][template_post])
and [a linter][sdxpy_lint] that checks whether the source of a Python program
obeys a set of rules.
Of these,
I think the second is more important:
the original `lint` utility on Unix helped me learn how to write C properly,
and I now set up [ruff][ruff] before writing the first line of Python in a new project.

One thing that surprised me as I was writing [Chapter 13: A Code Linter][sdxpy_lint]
was how few new ideas it needed to introduce.
By this point in the book,
readers have walked trees using the Visitor pattern
and understand that a program is just a data structure in memory.
Putting those two things together was a lot easier than I feared it would be;
in a way,
the fact that the concept map below is smaller than most of its predecessors
is a sign that I've put topics in the right (or "a" right) order.

*Note: I would be grateful for help getting [the book][sdxpy] to display properly in dark mode.
In particular, if you have a tool that will convert the SVG produced by [draw.io][draw_io] to white-on-black
and some CSS to select them in place of the black-on-white versions,
please [get in touch](mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com).*
