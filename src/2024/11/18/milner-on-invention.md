> When I was a PhD student, I attended a talk by the late Robin Milner where he said two things that have stuck with me.
> The first, I repeat quite often.
> He argued that credit for an invention did not belong to the first person to invent something
> but to the first person to explain it well enough that no one needed to invent it again.
> His first historical example was Leibniz publishing calculus and then Newton claiming he invented it first:
> it didn't matter if he did or not,
> he failed to explain it to anyone and so the fact that Leibniz needed to independently invent it was Newton's failure.
