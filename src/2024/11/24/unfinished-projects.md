What I should be working on:

1.  Re-doing the slides for [*SDXPY*][sdxpy] and recording a 30-minute video for each chapter
1.  Trying to get [*Beneath Coriandel*][coriandel], [*The Bookster's Apprentice*][bookster], and [*Still*][still-book] published
1.  Finishing *Iffy*, *All the Other Santas*, or the sequel to *Maddy Roo*
1.  Trying (again) to write [*Sex and Drugs and Guns and Code*][sdgc]

What I've learned about myself:

1.  I have lots of ideas, most of which don't make as much sense to other people as they do to me.
1.  I start things before I've thought them through.
1.  I have trouble finishing things (largely because of #2).
1.  I enjoy tinkering with small pieces of software much more than I enjoy contributing to large ones.
1.  I enjoy teaching and mentoring more than I enjoy managing.
1.  I run out of steam when I'm working on my own or don't have a specific audience and deadline.
