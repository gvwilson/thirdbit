title: "What Would Be in a New AOSA?"
date: 2024-10-28

My desktop background says "no new projects"
but that doesn't mean I can't dream.
It has been twelve years since we published the first two volumnes of
[*The Architecture of Open Source Applications*][aosa]:
if someone was going to put together a sequel with chapter-length descriptions of
the architectures of open source projects that have risen to prominence since then,
what would you want it to include?
Candidates so far include:

-   [dagster][dagster] and/or [Metaflow][metaflow]
-   [Dash][dash]
-   [deno][deno]
-   [duckdb][duckdb]
-   [DVC][dvc]
-   [Flask][flask] and/or [FastAPI][fastapi]
-   [Gleam][gleam]
-   [Haiku][haiku] and/or [SerenityOS][serenity]
-   [Immich][immich]
-   [Jellyfin][jellyfin]
-   [Kafka][kafka]
-   [Kubernetes][kubernetes]
-   [Mastodon][mastodon]
-   [Nushell][nushell]
-   [OpenTelemetry][opentelemetry]
-   [Polars][polars]
-   [PyTorch][pytorch] or [tensorflow][tensorflow]
-   [ruff][ruff]
-   [Tauri][tauri]
-   [Visual Studio Code][vscode]
-   [Vue.js][vuejs]

Two things stand out for me:

1.  There's a definite bias toward Python in this list,
    and a lamentable lack of distributed/fault-tolerant projects.
    Both are reflections of my biases and the biases of my circle of online acquaintances.

1.  I think this would be a great collection,
    but I'm just as interested in a book on
    the architecture of open source *organizations*.
    People talk about "the" open source community,
    but in practice we are hundreds or thousands of intersecting collections of people
    who have evolved many different ways to organize ourselves.
    I would love to read a collection of case studies of those different models,
    including commercial models.
    (Full disclore:
    my [current employer][plotly] is an open-core company,
    but our particular model is just one of many.)

I don't think I'll ever put either book together,
but if you're interested,
I'd be happy to offer advice.
