title: "What Would Be in a New AOSA?"
date: 2024-10-28

My desktop background says "no new projects"
but that doesn't mean I can't dream.
It has been twelve years since we published the first two volumnes of
[*The Architecture of Open Source Applications*][aosa]:
if someone was going to put together a sequel with chapter-length descriptions of
the architectures of open source projects that have risen to prominence since then,
what would you want it to include?
Candidates so far include:

1.  [Alpine.js][alpine]
1.  [Audacity][audacity] and/or [VLC][vlc]
1.  [dagster][dagster] and/or [Metaflow][metaflow]
1.  [Dash][dash]
1.  [deno][deno]
1.  [Discourse][discourse]
1.  [duckdb][duckdb]
1.  [DVC][dvc]
1.  [Flask][flask] and/or [FastAPI][fastapi]
1.  [Gleam][gleam]
1.  [Haiku][haiku] and/or [SerenityOS][serenity]
1.  [htmx][htmx]
1.  [Immich][immich]
1.  [Istio][istio]
1.  [Jellyfin][jellyfin]
1.  [Kafka][kafka]
1.  [Kubernetes][kubernetes]
1.  [Mastodon][mastodon]
1.  [Nushell][nushell]
1.  [OpenTelemetry][opentelemetry]
1.  [Plausible][plausible]
1.  [Polars][polars]
1.  [PyTorch][pytorch] and/or [tensorflow][tensorflow]
1.  [ruff][ruff]
1.  [Tauri][tauri]
1.  [Visual Studio Code][vscode]
1.  [Svelte][svelte] and/or [Vue.js][vuejs]

Two things stand out for me:

1.  There's a definite bias toward Python in this list,
    and a lamentable lack of distributed/fault-tolerant projects.
    Both are reflections of my biases and those of my acquaintances.

1.  I think this would be a great collection,
    but I'm just as interested in a book on
    the architecture of open source *organizations*.
    People talk about "the" open source community,
    but in practice we are hundreds or thousands of intersecting collections of people
    who have evolved many different ways to organize ourselves.
    I would love to read a collection of case studies of those different models,
    including commercial ones.
    (Full disclore:
    my [current employer][plotly] is an open-core company.)

I don't think I'll ever put either book together,
but as with the original volumes,
I think that assembling this would be a *great* project
for a graduate class in software architecture.
