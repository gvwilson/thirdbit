title: "How to Be Interviewed"

Earlier this week
I gave a short presentation to some undergrads at the University of Toronto
on how to be interviewed for internships.
The points I made are listed below;
as always, I'd be grateful for feedback.

## Why Should You Listen to Me?

-   Worked at six universities, a dozen companies, and a non-profit over 40 years
-   Supervised over 20 undergraduate interns and hired that many again for other people

## Why Shouldn't You Listen to Me?

-   I graduated in a tech boom 40 years ago — you are facing the toughest job market I've ever seen
-   You're probably not a middle-aged straight white guy
-   You're probably not applying for the same jobs I would
##  The Pipeline (Fall 2024 Edition)

| Step                        | Count  |
| :-------------------------- | -----: |
| Ad online (days)            |      5 |

| After first manual screen   |    289 |
| After second manual screen  |     45 |
| After HR screening call     |     28 |
| After 1/2 hr with me        |     12 |
| After coding interview      |      8 |
| Offers                      |      4 |

## Before We Talk to You

-   If you don't meet the legal criteria, please don't apply
-   Page 1 is the only page that matters
-   Don't waste space on "I'm a hard worker, quick to adapt, and a good team player"
    -   Because nobody says "I'm lazy, stubborn, and anti-social"
-   Tell me your GPA
    -   I'll wonder about it if you don't
    -   But note that I prefer consistency (B-B-B-B) to inconsistency (A-C-A-D)
-   If you say "42.3% improvement in customer retention", I'll ask for details…

## On <strike>the Phone</strike> Zoom

-   First screen is 15 minutes with HR
    -   If they find out you have misrepresented yourself, the conversation is over
-   Second is 30 minutes with me
-   Then a 50-minute coding interview

## My Script

-   Introductions
-   Icebreaker (2 min)
    -   What was your favorite course and why?
    -   What about your least favorite?
-   Walk me through the most complicated thing you've built (5-10 min)
    -   Tech stack
    -   Tech decisions you had to make and how you made them
    -   How did you know it actually worked?
    -   What would you do differently if you had to do it again?
-   Design question (5-10 min)
    -   Initially present a simple problem with a straightforward solution
    -   Then add a wrinkle that might require a change to that solution
    -   Add another complication that definitely requires backing up and re-thinking
-   Plotly (3-5 min)
    -   What we build
    -   How we're organized
-   Positions and projects
    -   Four open positions (Jan-Aug 2025)
    -   Probably work on 2-3 projects in that time
    -   Probably just one team, but who knows?
-   Questions?

## What I'm Looking For

-   Can you explain technical details?
    -   If it's on your resume, I'm allowed to drill down
    -   If you dodge, I'll definitely drill down
-   Can you explain why you built something as you did?
-   Can you think aloud / think with me?
-   Do you have interesting questions?
-   I.e., have you looked at my company's website?

## Coding Interview

-   Your CV tells me that you can write code
-   But can you debug?
    -   A better indicator than LeetCode exercises
-   We send a hundred-line program with some bugs and watch the candidate find them
-   They are allowed to use web search, AI, etc.
    -   We want to see how they actually code
    -   But we have to be able to see everything they're doing
-   What we're looking for
    -   How methodical are they?
    -   How well do they use their tools?
        -   Prefer debugger to print() or console.log()
	-   Bonus marks if they create a test case without being prompted
-   Do they ask for clarification when they need it?

## How You Can Help Each Other

-   Read and critique each other's CVs
-   Practice Q&A with each other
-   Learn to use your tools well
-   Build a personal website
    -   GitHub Pages is fine
-   Be kind
    -   You are not really each other's competition

## How to Improve Your Chances of Getting Re-hired

-   Learn [how to participate in a status meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtewOjRy-1U)
    -   Progress, plans, and problems go up
    -   Context and priorities come down
-   Learn how to review code software designs
-   Learn how to estimate how long things will take
    -   Optimists are tiring…
-   Learn (about) the other 90% of the business
    -   Ask to have a coffee with DevOps, Product Management, Customer Success, etc.
-   Be kind
