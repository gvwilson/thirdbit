title: "Cross One Off My List"

Thanks to a recommendation from [Jeff Ramnani][ramnani],
I borrow [Laurenţiu Spilcă][spilca]'s [*Troubleshooting Java*][troubleshooting-java]
from my local public library,
and am very glad I did.
The book delivers exactly what the title offers:
a step-by-step guide to finding and fixing problems in Java applications
using everything from breakpointing debuggers to profilers and specialized visualization tools.
I hope peopple are inspired by it to write equivalent books for JavaScript, Python, and other languages,
but even if that doesn't happen,
I'm glad to be able to cross one book off my [unwritten list][not-on-the-shelves].
