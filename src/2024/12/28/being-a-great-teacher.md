Three keys to being a great teacher:

1.  Have students who are safe and well nourished,
    not victims of systemic discrimination,
    and live in supportive home environments.

2.  Work in an educational system that has stable long-term funding
    and is administered by people who respect your professional expertise.

3.  Ignore posts that put all the responsibility for being a great teacher on you
    rather than saying that collective action to achieve #1 and #2 are what will actually make a difference.
