I caught up with some former colleagues this week,
and one of the questions that came up was,
"What would you do if you could have any job you wanted?"
I have two answers:

1.  A "scholar in residence" position where I spend my time connecting people,
    mentoring junior colleagues and their projects,
    and generally trying to nudge the world (or at least my corner of our profession)
    in a slightly healthier direction.
    I've always enjoyed this,
    and while [*The Architecture of Open Source Applications*][aosa]
    and [It Will Never Work in Theory][nwit] didn't become what I hoped they would,
    other ideas might.

1.  A mid-level developer position building software for scientists.
    I say "for scientists" because it's so rewarding,
    "building" because I miss being neck-deep in code,
    and "mid-level" because I'd really like to learn
    a few of the things that slid by me over the past twenty years.
    [Gleam][gleam]?
    [htmx][htmx]?
    [Marimo][marimo]?
    [Terraform][terraform]?
    It wouldn't really matter as long as I felt every day
    that I understood something I hadn't understood the day before.

I don't think I could combine these two roles
because I always put programming to the side if I'm managing and networking.
I also think that it would be easier for me to get the first role than the second:
our industry doesn't know what to do with people who want to take (what is viewed as)
a step down in their career for personal satisfaction.

The most surprising thing is that "teaching full-time" isn't on my list
for the first time in two decades.
I built [a tutorial on SQL][querynomicon] earlier this year,
and started on three others,
but it feels a bit like wandering the halls in my old high school.
I don't know anything well enough to teach it
that I didn't already know ten or fifteen years ago;
while there's a lot to be said for [playing the standards][late-night-thoughts],
my daughter will be moving out in a few months to start college,
and I need to find something to occupy my mind when she does.

p.s. one other thing I'd put on the wish list is an office within cycling distance.
I miss being able to grab a coffee with my co-workers once or twice a weekâ€¦
