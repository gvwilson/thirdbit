I have read the following recent-ish books about software engineering management
(or in a few cases, read the first couple of chapters and just skimmed the rest).
For the most part they treat the Silicon Valley model as a given,
and if they touch on things like labor rights
or what systemic discrimination reveals about how the system actually works,
they do so only in passing.
If you know of other books that are specifically about managing software development teams,
were published after 2010,
and grapple with [things VCs would rather not talk about][afraid-of-change],
I'd be grateful for pointers.
