After updating [my list of unwritten books][unwritten-2024] a few days ago,
I ran an online poll to ask people which ones they most wanted to read
and which ones they'd be willing to help write.
The results surprised me:
*Software Design as if Everyone Mattered* is a clear winner,
while *Sex and Drugs and Guns and Code* (the one I most want to read)
only placed fifth.
