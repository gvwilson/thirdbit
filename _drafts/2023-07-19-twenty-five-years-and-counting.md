Next Monday (July 24, 2023) is the 25th anniversary of the first Software Carpentry workshop
at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
[The Carpentries] is hosting a [roundtable][roundtable] to celebrate,
and to prepare for that I'd like to talk about how the world looks today:

1.  The Carpentries helped tens of thousands of researchers
    get more done in less time and with less pain;
    it's the most impactful thing I've ever been part of.

2.  It's still just a drop in the bucket.
    For example,
    about 35 wet lab biologists work with me here in Toronto.
    Most have graduate degrees,
    but only 3â€“4 had anything more than rudimentary programming skills before I arrived
    and only one had ever heard of the Carpentries.

Everywhere else I look I see the same drops and buckets.
Open access is more common than it was ten years ago,
but research publishing is still controlled by a handful of parasitic firms.
More researchers share open source software than ever before,
but building useful tools still won't get you tenure.
And while most companies, universities, and labs have diversity initiatives,
life is much more precarious for junior researchers with each passing year
and the whole idea of independent inquiry is under increasing attack.

Those problems might seem too big for a small non-profit to tackle,
but I think the Carpentries is already two-thirds of the way there.
In order,
the conversations go something like this:

1.  "Would you like to get more research done in less time and with less pain?
    Come to one of our programming workshops and we'll teach you how to code."

2.  "Would your life be easier if your colleagues also knew how to use version control?
    Come to one of our instructor training workshop and we'll teach you how to teach."

3.  [this is the new bit]
    "Are you tired of having to beg for space and funding for Carpentries workshops?
    Come to one of our workshops on community building
    and we'll teach you the basics of organizational change."

That third part is deliberately framed to be non-threatening,
but if you teach people how to get on the committee that oversees the training budget,
they can use those same skills to get a meaningful computational skills course
in the undergrad curriculum.
Doing that will give them the experience and the connections they need
to tackle promotion and tenure rules
or to run for the board of the [AGU][agu], [APS][aps], [ESA][esa],
and [organizations so venerable that they predate acronyms][royal-society].

This is often how [peaceful][bpco] [change][quiet-before] [happens][fearless-change]:
an organization created to address one problem becomes a training ground for solving others,
while lessons learned in the small prevent mistakes later on that would hurt a lot more.
I also think that aiming at a larger target would help address
the volunteer fatigue that mature volunteer organizations inevitably experience.
It's hard for people to keep rolling the same rock up the same hill year after year,
particularly when the news is full of stories about climate change,
COVID-19,
and a rising tide of ugly right-wing nationalism.
"Come for the coding,
stay for the teaching,
leave knowing how to fight for a better world"
might just be the thing to get people excited again.

Five years ago I [spoke][dublin-video] about what it was like
to step away from Software Carpentry
after putting so much into it for so many years.
I said then that we need more science and more courage
if we're to have even a chance of getting through the next fifty years.
I now believe that we also need to learn how to organize,
just as we have learned how to code and how to teach.
It's a lot to ask of people who are already working as hard as they can
and a lot harder than they should have to,
but if we all give a little,
we'll all gain a lot.
So,
one more time:
