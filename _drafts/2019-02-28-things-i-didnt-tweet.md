-   [Classifying Data]({{site.github.url}}/2019/02/04/classifying-data.html)

-   [Libraries Tell It Like It Is]({{site.github.url}}/2019/02/05/libraries-tell-it-like-it-is.html)

-   [Late Binding]({{site.github.url}}/2019/02/16/late-binding.html)

-   [Greenspun's Eleventh Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule):
    any sufficiently complicated text formatting system contains an ad-hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden
    implementation of half of LaTeX.

-   I can't stop wondering what phones and tablets and laptops would look like
    if Ikea had swooped in and scooped up Nokia
    and was now in the electronics business.
    They have the design skills, the supply chains, the distribution, and the marketing,
    and personally,
    I'd be very happy to buy a phone with a polished pine case.

-   [Open source and its commercial users summarized in one short video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqQgDwA0BNU)

-   I really enjoyed *[Understanding How We Learn](http://www.learningscientists.org/book)*;
    I hope that one day we'll know enough about the psychology of programming
    that someone will be able to write *Understanding How We Code*.

-   We're not going to get "CS for All" unless we get a decent education for all,
    so if you really want the first,
    you have to work on the second as well.
    (See also [Pasi Sahlberg's essay](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/what-the-us-cant-learn-from-finland-about-ed-reform/2012/04/16/gIQAGIvVMT_blog.html)
    explaining why the US can't replicate the successes of Finland's educational system.)

-   Of the 53 names on the February 1 list of instructors and helpers for upcoming Carpentry workshops,
    I only knew 8.

-   Saying, "If you need to comment your code, you should write clearer code,"
    is like saying, "If you need to use English in your proof, you should write clearer formulas."

-   I would really like stats from various tech publishers on the proportion of their authors of various genders.

-   "I have a love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine and rage the likes of which you would not believe.
    If I cannot satisfy the one, I will indulge the other." -- Mary Shelley, *Frankenstein*

-   "When people talk about traveling to the past, they worry about radically changing the present by doing something small,
    but barely anyone in the present really thinks that they can radically change the future by doing something small."

-   "I am, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein's brain
    than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields and sweatshops."
    -- Stephen Jay Gould

-   [This tweet](https://twitter.com/juliansimioni/status/1086289665194217472) pretty much sums it up.

-   I'm no good at writing villains.

-   [Rebel Against the Kings of Babylon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ge7j5wyVvo)

-   I almost re-enabled my Twitter account so that I could re-tweet [this](https://twitter.com/SlacktivistFred/status/1096165930365796357).

-   Nobody's design doc ever includes "complexity" as a goal,
    so including "simplicity" in a list seems kind of superfluous to me.
    Ditto "seamless";
    nobody ever says, "Oh, we offer seamful integration---very seamful."

-   The truth points to itself.

-   You can run JavaScript code using Node from inside RMarkdown documents by using a `{node}` language specifier.
    If I had known this six months ago,
    I would have used it for [*JavaScript versus Data Science*](https://software-tools-in-javascript.github.io/js-vs-ds/).

-   [Libraries are cool](https://twitter.com/lindsiecanton/status/1098043838621499392).

-   Some day there's going to be an even grittier reboot of *Battlestar Galactica*.
