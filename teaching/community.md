# Building Community

*This section is currently under development:
[feedback](mailto:gvwilson@third-bit.com?feedback%20on%20Building%20Community) would be appreciated.*

One person can only do so much.
Just as we learn best together,
we teach best when we are teaching with other people,
and the best way to achieve that is to build a community.

A framework in which to think about doing this is
_[situated learning](gloss.html#situated-learning)_,
which focuses on how _[legitimate peripheral participation](gloss.html#legitimate-peripheral-participation)_
leads to people becoming members of a _[community of practice](gloss.html#community-of-practice)_.
Unpacking those terms,
a community of practice is a group of people bound together by interest in some activity,
such as knitting or particle physics.
Legitimate peripheral participation means doing simple, low-risk tasks
that community nevertheless recognizes as valid contributions:
making your first scarf,
stuffing envelopes during an election campaign,
or proof-reading documentation for open source software.

Situated learning focuses on
the transition from being a newcomer to being accepted as a peer
by those who are already community members.
This typically means starting with simplified tasks and tools,
then doing similar tasks with more complex tools,
and finally tackling the challenges of advanced practitioners.
For example,
children learning music may start by playing nursery rhymes on a recorder or ukulele,
then play other simple songs on a trumpet or saxophone in a band,
and finally start exploring their own musical tastes.
Healthy communities understand and support these progressions,
and recognize that each step is meant to give people a ramp rather than a cliff.

Whatever the domain,
situated learning emphasizes that learning is a social activity.
In order to be effective and sustainable,
teaching therefore needs to be rooted in a community;
if one doesn't exist,
you need to build one.

## Learn, Then Do

The first step in building a community is to decide if you really need to,
or whether you would be more effective joining an existing organization.
Thousands of groups are already teaching people tech skills,
from the [4-H Club][4h] and [literacy programs][frontier-college]
to get-into-coding non-profits like [Black Girls Code][bgc].
Joining an existing group will give you a head start on teaching,
an immediate set of colleagues,
and a chance to learn more about how to run things.
The only thing it *won't* give you is the ego gratification and control
that comes from being a founder.

Whether you join an existing group or set up one of your own,
you owe it to yourself and everyone who's going to work with you
to find out what's been done before.
People have been writing about grassroots organizing for decades;
[[Alinsky1989](biblio.html#alinsky-rules)] is probably the best-known work on the subject,
while [[Brown2007](biblio.html#brown-bpco)]
and [[Midwest2010](biblio.html#midwest-organizing)]
are practical manuals rooted in decades of practice.
If you want to read more deeply,
[[Adams1975](biblio.html#adams-seeds)] is a history of the Highlander Folk School,
whose approach has been emulated by many successful groups,
while [[Spalding2014](biblio.html#spalding-adults)] is a guide to teaching adults
written by someone with deep personal roots in organizing.

## Marketing

Nobody's going to come to a meeting unless they know about it,
and nobody's going to help you raise money if they don't know how you're going to spend it.
Mailing lists, blogs, and Twitter all give you ways to stay in touch.
Use them sparingly so that your audience isn't overwhelmed,
but use them:
[[KuchnerFIXME](biblio.html#kuchner-marketing)] is a good place to start for guidance.

*Marketing* is the craft of seeing things from other people's
perspective, understanding their wants and needs, and finding ways to
meet them.

A *brand* is someone's first reaction to a mention of a product.
- If their reaction is "what's that?", you don't have a brand yet.
- If you can't be first in a category, create a new category that
  you can be first in.
- Not as cynical as it sounds: if someone else is already doing
  what you're doing better than you, find something else to do.
- *Get a logo*.

What are you offering to whom?
- Cite Kuchner: scientists think their product is papers, but they're wrong.
  - Their product is their grant proposals: that's what gets funded.
  - Their papers are their advertising.
- Use weekend coding workshops as an example:
  - Learners pay: the product is the workshop, but what are you selling to instructors?
  - Sponsors pay: the workshops are ads, and the product is the grant proposal.
  - What are you selling to volunteer instructors?
    - Personal branding.
    - Good feelings.
    - Recruitment opportunity.

Compare concerns:
- Theater owner: do we have enough popcorn, are our ads up to date, who's working tonight?
- Movie goer: what's playing when and where, how much will it cost, is it accessible?

Make a list of reasons that people will come to your classes, and *check them*.
- People buy healthy food because it's healthy,
  but also because of the story they tell themselves about themselves,
  and because it's what their friends are buying.
- I wear a t-shirt with a tech logo and a pair of jeans when I'm teaching programmers,
  but business casual when I'm teaching recent immigrants,
  because I want to fit into their story.

Props make a story real.
- Show people a game or a website that your students made.
- Give them something quirky from the 3D printer.

Free samples are compelling.
- Lessons online.
- Videos of actual workshops.
- Lunchtime sessions, but only where practical and effective.

Positioning is what sets your offering apart from others.
- Include the standard elevator pitch here as an exercise.
- When pitching, adapt the "what's in it for me?" part to the person you're speaking to.
  - Because we're all tired of generic emails.
- Good way to do this is to use personas, but for other stakeholders.
  - Exercise

Bad responses to "So tell me about your classes?"
- "We teach programming." (stop)
  - Like learners, community will never be more excited than you are.
- "The students really don't seem interested, and we're really struggling to get software installed."
  - Make people feel sorry for you *after* they already care about you.

Findability.
- What do people find when they search online for what you offer?
- Just as important: how will they find you if they *aren't* online?
  - Because a lot of people you might want to help aren't.
  - And the ubiquity of online has devalued it.

Find allies.
- Have you ever spoken to someone from your college or school board PR office, or yo city councilor's office?
- Start building that relationship early by asking for help.
  - How do they think you ought to raise awareness of what you're doing?
  - They'll have useful advice, be flattered to be asked, and will know who you are when you have something to say.

The bigger picture.
- Combine marketing what you do in particular with marketing the subject as a whole.
- There's room enough for everyone, so join forces with other groups.
  - Referrals.

Marketing blends into engagement (next section).
- Instead of engaging teachers, you're engaging students and backers.
- Learners want what you teach.
  - Refer back to motivation section: what do your learners want, and how do you know?
- Backers want a variety of things.
  - Other people's success in general (enlightened self-interest).
  - Their community's success.
  - Productive employees or grad students.
  - Their own success (your success makes them look good).

Be comfortable with rejection.
- 2-3% is considered good in most sales organizations.
- And don't think rejection is final: add a note to your calendar to try
  again in six months, and only give up if you get a second "no".

### The Art of the Cold Call

1. I always open by apologizing for adding to their inbox. (It's a
   Canadian thing...)

1. Always establish a point of connection: "I was speaking to X" or
   "You attended bootcamp Y". This must be specific: spammers and
   headhunters have trained us all to ignore anything that starts,
   "I recently read a paper of yours".

1. Explain how we're going to help make their lives better (e.g.,
   "Your graduate students will be able to push your project XYZ ahead
   much faster if you let us help them").

1. Be specific (e.g., "Our usual two-day curriculum includes...") so
   that they can figure out right away whether this is worth pursuing.

1. Cite our backers, our size, or our instructors to make us more
   credible.

1. Create a slight sense of urgency ("we're booking workshops right
   now").

1. Tell them that we're a volunteer organization, so that all they'll
   have to pay for is instructors' travel and accommodation, along
   with a contribution toward central costs (currently around $1500
   per bootcamp).

1. Above all, keep it short. The message below takes 30 seconds or
   less to scan; add another few seconds for them to check the Cc:
   list (where possible, approach people in groups), and either
   they're hooked enough to hit 'reply' or they're not.

It's worked pretty well: about half of emails are answered, about half
of those answers are, "Sure, let's talk more," and about half of those
discussions lead to workshops, which means that 10-15% of targeted
emails turn into workshops. This is a lot more impressive than it
might sound—most people in sales figure that 2-3% conversion on cold
calls is outstanding.

Writing proposals is out of scope of this book.

## Engagement

The community organizer Saul Alinksy said,
"If your people aren't having a ball doing it, there is something very wrong."
Community members shouldn't expect to enjoy every moment of their work with your organization,
but if they don't enjoy any of it,
they won't stay.
One way to do this is to thank people:
everyone likes to be appreciated,
and communities should acknowledge their members' contributions both publicly and privately.

The [Ben Franklin Effect][franklin-effect]: a person who has performed
a favor for someone is more likely to do another favor for that person
than they would be if they had received a favor from that person.
- Works equally well for good or evil.

FIXME: ask people what they want rather than guessing.

FIXME: soup, then hymns.
Manifestos are great,
but most people join a volunteer community to help and be helped.
Focus on things that are immediately useful,
e.g.,
on what can people create that will be used by other community members write away.
Once your organization shows that it can actually achieve things–even small things–people
will be more confident that it's worth thinking about bigger issues.

One way to make participation rewarding is to provide training.
Organizations require committees, meetings, budgets, grant proposals, and dispute resolution;
most people are never taught how to do any of this,
any more than they are taught how to teach,
but training people to do these things helps your organization run more smoothly,
and the opportunity to gain transferable skills
is a powerful reason for people to get and stay involved.

FIXME: borrow training, don't do it yourself.

One important special case of making things rewarding is to pay people.
Volunteers can do a lot,
but tasks like system administration and accounting need full-time paid staff.
FIXME: difficult transition.

Micromanaging or trying to control everything centrally
means people won't feel they have the autonomy to act,
which will probably cause them to drift away.
In particular,
if you're too engaged or too quick on the reply button,
people have less opportunity to grow as members
and to create horizontal collaborations.
The community can continue to be "hub and spoke",
focused around one or two individuals,
rather than a highly-connected network
in which others feel comfortable participating.

FIXME: pathways to contribution (examples).

## Governance

Every organization has a power structure:
the only question is whether it's formal and accountable,
or informal and unaccountable
[[Freeman][FIXME]].
Make yours one of the first kind:
write and publish the rules governing everything from
who's allowed to use the name and logo
to who gets to decide whether people are allowed to charge money to teach
with whatever materials your group has worked up.

FIXME: don't do this too soon,
since it results in endless wrangling about what we're going to do
rather than formalization of what we're already doing.

When the time comes to formalize your rules,
make your organization a democracy:
sooner or later (usually sooner),
every appointed board turns into a mutual agreement society
and loses sight of what the community it's meant to serve actually needs.
Giving the community power is messy,
but is the only way invented so far to ensure that
an organization continues to meet people's actual needs.

FIXME: borrow a constitution.

## Look After Yourself

As [[PigniFIXME][FIXME]] discusses,
burnout is a chronic risk in any community activity.
If you don't take care of yourself,
you won't be able to take care of your community.

Every organization eventually needs fresh ideas and fresh leadership.
When that time comes,
train your successors and then move on.
They will undoubtedly do things you wouldn't have,
but the same is true of every generation.
Few things in life are as satisfying as
watching something you helped build take on a life of its own.
Celebrate that–you won't have any trouble finding
something else to keep you busy.
