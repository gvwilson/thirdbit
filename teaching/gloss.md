# Glossary

*   **Authentic Task**:
    <a name="authentic-task"></a>
    A task which contains important elements of things that learners would
    do in real (non-classroom situations).  To be authentic, a task should
    require learners to construct their own answers rather than choose
    between provided answers, and to work with the same tools and data
    they would use in real life.

*   **Behaviorism**:
    <a name="behaviorism"></a>
    A theory of learning whose central principle is stimulus and response,
    and whose goal is to explain behavior without recourse to internal
    mental states or other unobservables.
    <br>
    See also [cognitivism](gloss.html#cognitivism).

*   **Bloom's Taxonomy**:
    <a name="blooms-taxonomy"></a>
    <span class="changed" markdown="1">
    A six-part hierarchical classification of understand
    whose levels are *knowledge*, *comprehension*, *application*,

    [Cognitive load][wikipedia-cognitive-load] is the amount of mental
