Thousands of grassroots "learn to code" groups have sprung up in the
past few years.  They exist so that people don't have to figure out
how to program on their own, but ironically, that's exactly what most
of their founders are doing when it comes to teaching.

As many have discovered, there's more to teaching than talking.  Good
teachers break subjects up into digestible pieces, design lessons with
verifiable goals in mind, check their students' progress at short
intervals, and encourage collaboration and improvisation.  Like good
programming practices, these don't have to be reinvented by every
teacher: they can and should be taught and learned.  And while these
practices won't magically make someone a *great* teacher, they do make
most people *better* teachers.

This book is a brief introduction to modern evidence-based teaching
practices and how to use them to teach programming to free-range
learners.  It covers:

*   how people's thinking changes as they go from being novices to
    competent practitioners and then to being experts;

*   how to tell if your learners are keeping up with you, and what to
    do or say when they're not;

*   how to design and improve lessons efficiently and collaboratively;

*   how and why [live coding](live.html) (i.e., writing programs step by
    step in front of learners) is a better way to teach programming
    than lectures or self-directed practice; and

*   how insights and techniques borrowed from the performing arts can
    make you a better teacher.

## History

I started teaching people how to program in the late 1980s.  At first,
I went too fast, used too much jargon, and had little idea of how much
my learners actually understood.  I got better over time, but still
had no idea how effective I was compared to other teachers.

In 2010, I rebooted a project called [Software Carpentry][swc-site],
whose aim is to teach basic computing skills to researchers.  In the
years that followed, I discovered resources like Mark Guzdial's blog
[[Guzdial2017](biblio.html#guzdial-blog)] and the book *How Learning
Works* [[Ambrose2010](biblio.html#ambrose-hlw)].  These led me to
[[Lemov2014](biblio.html#lemov-champion)],
[[Huston2009](biblio.html#huston-dont-know)],
[[Green2014](biblio.html#green-babt)], and other sources that showed me
how to make my teaching better and why I should believe it would
work.

We started using these ideas in [Software Carpentry][swc-site] in
2012, and the results were everything we'd hoped for.  We also started
offering a short course to introduce people to these techniques and
the ideas behind them.  This course was originally delivered online
over multiple weeks, but by 2014 we were teaching it in two intensive
days (just like our regular software skills workshops).  Since then, I
have run the course more than forty times for people who want to teach
programming to children, recent immigrants, women re-entering the
workforce, and a wide variety of other groups.  Those experiences are
the basis of this book.

## Who You Are

[Learner Personas](lessons.html#learner-personas) will explain how to
define who a class is for.  Here, we present personas of two typical
participants in a workshop based on this book.

**Samira** is an undergraduate student in mechanical engineering who
first encountered the subject in an after-school club for girls and
would now like to pass on her love for it.  She has done one
programming class and one robotics class, and was a lab assistant for
a couple of weekend introductions to engineering for high school
students at her university.  Feels insecure about standing up and
teaching a subject that she isn't an expert in ("I'm not a
professor!").

Samira would like to learn techniques for explaining ideas and
handling unexpected questions or situations.  This workshop will
introduce her to some basic classroom practices and give her a chance
to try them out in front of a supportive audience.

**Moshe** is a professional programmer with two young children.  Their
school doesn't offer a programming class, so he has volunteered to put
one together.  He has been programming in Visual Basic and C# for
almost twenty years, during which time he has frequently given
presentations to colleagues and management, but after reading a dozen
different "programming for kids" books, he feels more confused than
ever about what to do.

Moshe wants to learn how to build lessons that both he and other
people can use and maintain.  This class will show him how to design
and deliver lessons tailored for his students, how to tell how well
those lessons are working, and how to keep those lessons up to date.

Moshe is partially deaf, and most of his students have hearing
disabilities as well.

## Teaching Practices

We suggest that instructor training workshops use these three teaching
practices right from the start:

*   Have a [code of conduct](practices.html#have-a-code-of-conduct).

*   [Take notes together](practices.html#take-notes-together).

*   [Pre-assess](practices.html#assess-motivation-and-prior-knowledge)
    learners' motivation and prior knowledge.
