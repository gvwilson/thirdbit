<h3>What "Business of Software" Doesn't Teach</h3>
<p>
  Many universities offer an undergraduate course on entrepreneurship
  or the business of software. This project will survey these courses
  to determine what they <em>don't</em> teach. For example, how many
  of these courses (if any) devote time to labor rights? How many
  discuss anti-trust legislation? And how does that vary by country
  and by the nature of the institution?
