<h3>Comparing Slideshow Tools</h3>
<p>
  Are slideshows written using HTML- or Markdown-based tools more
  text-intensive than those written in PowerPoint?  Putting it another
  way, are slides written in formats that version control understands
  (text) less likely to use diagrams than slides written with GUI
  tools? To answer this question, the student(s) doing this project
  will have to develop ways to quantify how graphical or textful a
  presentation is, and learn how to make work of this kind
  reproducible.
