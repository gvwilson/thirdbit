<h3>Altruism in Software Teams</h3>
<p>
  The aim of this project is to see if it is possible to detect
  altruism in software teams (i.e., to measure how much time developer
  A spends helping developer B even though B's problem isn't
  officially A's concern). If so, the research will try to determine
  if there is any correlation between altruism and (for example) staff
  turnover or the long-term maintainability of the code base.
