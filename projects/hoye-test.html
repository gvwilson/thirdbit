<h3>The Hoye Test</h3>
<p>
  The Turing Test classifies a machine as "intelligent" if an
  independent observer can't distinguish between it and a human being
  in conversation.  This project will implement a similar test for
  malicious software (which we call
  the <a href="https://exple.tive.org/blarg/">Hoye Test</a> in honor
  of the person who proposed it): pick an application (e.g., a
  discussion forum), build a work-alike that is deliberately malicious
  in some way (e.g., designed to radicalize its users), and then have
  people use both and guess which is which.
