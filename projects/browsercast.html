<h3>Browsercast</h3>
<p>
  Tools like PowerPoint aren't web-friendly.  When you export a
  slideshow to the web, what you get is a bunch of images, while
  screencasts are opaque to search engines and disability aids.  In
  contrast, <a href="https://github.com/gvwilson/browsercast">Browsercast</a>
  plays snippets of audio in the browser as the viewer moves through
  the slides, so "View Source", links, CSS, screen readers, and search
  work as they should.  The prototype uses just 5kb of JavaScript; the
  aim of this project is to turn it into a functional tool.
