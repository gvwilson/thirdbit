<h3>Extending Lox</h3>
<p>
  Lox is a simple interpreted language created by Robert Nystrom for
  his book <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/"><em>Crafting
  Interpreters</em></a>. Many people have extended it in various ways;
  in this project, students would re-create Lox by working through the
  second half of Nystrom's book, then add operator overloading,
  cooperative concurrency, and a few other features to bring the
  language up to par with <a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>.
