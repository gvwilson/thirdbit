<h3>Simulations of Distributed Systems</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/"><em>Software Design by
  Example in Python</em></a> deliberately ignored concurrency, partial
  failure, and everything else associated with modern distributed
  applications. The aim of this project is to (start to) fix that by
  building scale models of distributed protocols and systems from TCP
  to BitTorrent and load-balancing tools using either
  <a href="https://pydes.readthedocs.io/">Py-DES</a>
  or <a href="https://simpy.readthedocs.io/">SimPy</a>. The tutorials
  will use simulators so that the accompanying lessons could
  illustrate edge cases in reproducible ways.
