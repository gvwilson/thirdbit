<h3>A Blocks-Based Data Science Tool</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/tidyblocks/tidyblocks">TidyBlocks</a>
  was a prototype of a
  <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>-like tool for
  teaching introductory data ascience.  It turned out to be an
  inappropriate visual paradigm, as there was no natural way to
  represent join operations as nested blocks.  The aim of this project
  is to explore an alternative using a node-and-connector model like
  that of <a href="https://nodered.org/">Node-RED</a>
  or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Pipes">Yahoo!
  Pipes</a>.
