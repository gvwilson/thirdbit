<h3>Narwhals</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://narwhals-dev.github.io/narwhals/">Narwhals</a> is a
  Python package that provides compatibility between dataframe
  libraries, allowing applications to use
  <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>, <a href="https://pola.rs/">Polars</a>,
  and other libraries through a common API. Students working on this
  project will contribute directly to Narwhals, and will be
  responsible for fixing bugs, designing new features, and shepherding
  their work through review into production.
