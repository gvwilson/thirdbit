<h3>The Impact of Calibrated Code Review</h3>
<p>
  Give a novice programmer a one-page program and have them score it
  using a checklist, then grade them on how closely their scoring
  matches the instructor’s. (They start with 100%, and lose one mark
  for each false positive or false negative.) After doing this a
  handful of times, they should learn to see code through the
  instructor’s eyes. Does this help them write better code? If so, how
  quickly and how well?  This project will attempt to answer these
  questions.
