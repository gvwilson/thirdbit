<h3>Software Design for Everyone</h3>
<p>
  Each lesson in this tutorial will present a "what if?" scenario and
  then explores its implications for software design.  How would you
  redesign a cell phone app if you had crippling arthritis (which you
  can simulate by taping popsicle sticks to your fingers)?  What if
  you thought your government might take a sharp turn to the right and
  retroactively weaponize women's health records: (how) could you
  satisfy doctors' need for information with patient safety? The
  practical exercises will assume enough programming skill to build
  simple web applications.
