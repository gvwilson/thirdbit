<h3>Markdown to DOM</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://python-markdown.github.io/">Python-Markdown</a>
  converts Markdown to HTML; if an application needs a DOM tree that
  it can check or manipulate, it must then parse the HTML using a
  library like <a href="https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/">BeautifulSoup</a>,
  perform whatever operations it needs to, and then convert the DOM
  back to HTML. In this project, students will refactor
  Python-Markdown so that it can generate a Beautiful Soup-compatible
  DOM tree directly.
