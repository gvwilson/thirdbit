<h3>Unbreaking Software</h3>
<p>
  Most programmers spend a large part of their time debugging, but
  most courses only show working code, and most textbooks don't
  discuss how to prevent, diagnose, and fix errors.  This tutorial
  will fill that gap by presenting dozens of case studies showing how
  to find and fix real-world problems.  Along the way, it will present
  examples of what programmers can do to handle errors gracefully,
  from data structure repair to automatically restarting servers.
