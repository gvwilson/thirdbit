<h3>Marimo and H5P</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://marimo.io/">Marimo</a> is a next-generation
  computational notebook that enables data scientists to mix code,
  discussion, and results in a reproducible way.  Its plugin system
  relies on <a href="https://anywidget.dev/">AnyWidget</a>, which
  specifies a simple contract between extensions and Marimo's
  rendering and execution engine.  The aim of this project is to
  design, build, and test a set of Marimo plugins that can be used for
  classroom exercises similar to those in the
  <a href="https://h5p.org/content-types-and-applications">H5P</a>
  toolkit: multiple choice, fill in the blanks, and so on.
