<h3>A Tower Support Game</h3>
<p>
  A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense">tower defense game</a>
  is one in which the player builds fixed defenses against incoming waves of
  attackers. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Rush">Kingdom Rush</a>
  is a personal favorite.) The objective of this game is to prototype a simple
  tower <em>support</em> game, in which the player builds bridges, first aid
  stations, and so on to help travelers reach their destination.
