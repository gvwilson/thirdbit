<h3>Code Selectors</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_selectors">CSS
  Selectors</a> allow developers to select elements in a web page,
  and <a href="https://jqlang.github.io/jq/manual/">jq</a> offers a
  similar notation for selecting elements in JSON documents. The aim
  of this project is to develop a similar notation for selecting
  blocks of source code, e.g., to say, "Get the first for loop in the
  method <code>m</code> in the class <code>C</code>".  The primary use
  case will be including snippets of code in books and tutorials, so
  the notation must be able to handle multiple languages.
