<h3>Understanding Ethics</h3>
<p>
  This project will start by creating a set of scenarios in which a
  programmer needs to make an ethical decision, each with
  multiple-choice options.  An expert will determine the best answer
  for each; students and professionals will then be asked to answer
  the same questions, and the results will be analyzed to see how well
  each group matches the experts' opinions and whether practitioners'
  opinions are any better than those of students.
