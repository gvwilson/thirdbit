<h3>Software Design by Example in Gleam</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://gleam.run/">Gleam</a> is a modern functional language that runs on the
  <a href="https://www.erlang.org/">Erlang/OTP</a> platform (and can
  also be compiled to JavaScript). The aim of this project is to
  translate examples from <a href="@root/sdxpy/"><em>Software Design
  by Example</em></a> into Gleam to help people coming from Python and
  other mainstream languages understand how to use FP in practice.
