<h3>XKCD Charts</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://timqian.com/chart.xkcd/">Chart.xkcd</a> is a
  JavaScript library that displays charts in the sketchy hand-drawn
  style of <a href="https://xkcd.com/">XKCD</a>. Its creator is no
  longer maintaining it; this project will fork the original code, fix
  outstanding issues, and add new features such as axis limits and
  stable coloring schemes.
