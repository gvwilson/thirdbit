<h3>Tooling Effort over Time</h3>
<p>
  How does the percentage of effort devoted to tooling and deployment
  change as a project grows and/or ages?  And how has it changed as
  we've moved from desktop applications to cloud-based applications?
  Once a project reaches a certain size, does the amount of tooling
  (measured by number of files or lines of configuration) level off?
  Does the effort required to maintain the tooling grow as the code
  base grows, or does it level off as well? Answering these questions
  will give the student(s) a chance to learn how to mine software
  repositories.
