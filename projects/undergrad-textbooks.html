<h3>Analysis of Undergrad Textbooks</h3>
<p>
  Most undergraduate computer science programs have a first- or
  second-year course on data structures and algorithms.  What do these
  courses actually teach, how has their content changed since
  Wirth's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_%2B_Data_Structures_%3D_Programs">classic
  book</a> appeared in 1976, and which of these algorithms and data
  structures are used in upper-year courses? To answer these
  questions, this project will assemble and apply tools to analyze the
  text of several dozen textbooks; along the way, the students doing
  the project will have to decide how to identify topics, how to count
  them, and how to make their work reproducible.
