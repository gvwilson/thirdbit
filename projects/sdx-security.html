<h3>Software Security by Example</h3>
<p>
  The first lesson in this tutorial will present a simple
  implementation of a wiki designed for shared note-taking.  Each of
  the following lessons will fix one of its security shortcomings (or
  one of the shortcomings introduced by an earlier fix).  Some will be
  vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting or SQL injection;
  others will be missing features such as basic authentication or
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a>, role-based
  access control, the kind of logging that every sys admin wishes they
  had, static code analysis, and eventually the audit and emergency
  response procedures that such tools are meant to support.
