<h3>Generative Art</h3>
<p>
  The goal of this project is to translate Danielle Navarro's tutorial
  on generative art that starts
  with <a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2024-12-18_art-from-code-1/">this
  blog post</a> from R to Python. By the end, learners should be able
  to build software that creates art like the examples
  in <a href="https://art.djnavarro.net/gallery/">this gallery</a>.

  <em>Keywords: Python, R, generative art</em>
