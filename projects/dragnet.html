<h3>Dragnet</h3>
<p>
  One type of exercise that H5P <em>doesn't</em> support is adding
  labels to diagrams. <a href="https://iezer.github.io/dragnet/">This
  prototype</a> takes an SVG with some specially-marked labels, moves
  those labels to the side, and then lets the user try to drag them
  back into the right places.  A deployable version would need to do a
  lot more, such as dealing with scaling transformations; the goal of
  this project is to turn the demo into something a classroom teacher
  could use.
