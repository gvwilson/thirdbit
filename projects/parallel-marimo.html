<h3>Parallelizing Marimo Notebooks</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://marimo.io/">Marimo</a> is a next-generation
  computational notebook that (a) stores everything as Python source
  code and (b) analyzes code to prevent out-of-order execution of
  cells. <a href="https://dagster.io/">Dagster</a> and
  <a href="https://metaflow.org/">Metaflow</a> are computational
  workflow tools that allow users to add decorators to functions and
  methods to specify computational chunks. The goal of this project is
  to see if the two can be married, i.e., to see if it's possible to
  add decorators to cell functions in Marimo to parallelize notebooks
  directly.
