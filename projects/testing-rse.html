<h3>Testing Research Software</h3>
<p>
  The <a href="@root/sdxjs/">JavaScript</a> and
  <a href="@root/sdxpy/">Python</a> versions of <em>Software Design by
  Example</em> showed readers how to design programs by working
  through scaled-down examples. In contrast, this project will develop
  scaled-down versions of things like
  <a href="https://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/">fluid
  flow simulators</a> and data analysis pipelines, and then shows
  readers how to test them.  Each lesson will open with a short recap
  of the science and a walk-through of the untested code, then explore
  how that code can be tested.
