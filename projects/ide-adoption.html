<h3>Student Adoption of IDE Tools</h3>
<p>
  Which features of integrated development environments (IDEs) do
  students actually use? To find out, this project will have a set of
  students record their screens while solving a set of programming and
  debugging problems, then analyze those recordings to see whether and
  when students use breakpointing debuggers, multiple cursors,
  refactoring tools, and other features.
