<h3>Session Recording and Playback</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://asciinema.org/">asciinema</a> and similar tools can
  record a terminal window session and play it back in another
  terminal or in a browser.
  <a href="https://github.com/gvwilson/lanimret">This prototype</a>
  adds audio recording and synchronized playback so that (for example)
  an instructor can record a live coding session with a voiceover for
  a learner to go through later. This project will extend that
  prototype to replay sessions in the browser.
