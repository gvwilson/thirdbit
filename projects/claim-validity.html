<h3>Validity of Claims</h3>
<p>
  Are some programmers really ten times more productive than others?
  Does test-driven development actually make programmers more
  productive?  And do people actually believe these claims?  This
  project will conduct a quantitative survey of best-selling books on
  software developmnt to measure how many of their claims are backed
  by citations, and of those, how many are considered valid, then
  survey programmers to see which (if any) they believe.
