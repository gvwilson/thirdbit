<h3>Ghost Engineers</h3>
<p>
  A junk "study" about "ghost engineers" that appeared in late 2024
  was probably viewed more times than every carefully-done study in
  empirical software engineering published in that year. The aim of
  this project is to see if that claim is true, i.e., to estimate how
  many people read or re-posted that study and compare it to estimates
  of the number of people outside academia who read or quoted
  reputable peer-reviewed studies.
