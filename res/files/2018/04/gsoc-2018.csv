3DTK,Ichiho Ojima,Replacing the glui GUI with a Qt5 GUI,"3DTK provides a program to visualize point clouds called “show”.  GUI of “show” is written by glui framework now, but glui framework is old and difficult to maintain.  Therefore, it is necessary to replace “show” GUI with a more general framework such as Qt5.  3DTK developers have already started this rewriting, and this project is called “qtshow”.  However, “qtshow” still misses a lot of functionality compared to  “show”.  Because of this, I improve these problems and add some features which are in “show” but not in “qtshow”."

AOSSIE - Australian Open Source Software Innovation and Education,Abanda Ludovic,Agora web API and Frontend project,"Agora is a library of data structures and algorithms for counting votes in elections. Agora-web, is a website to conduct online elections. As mentioned on the project idea page this project will create a working API and a frontend that will consume the API resources. Separating the frontend from the backend is a great idea, since other end user interfaces such as android applications, Desktop applications, IOS app can be created to consume the same API. This will enable users to work with their preferred interface and thus increase the usability of Agora platform as a whole. So this project will create an API and a  web frontend using  angular 5 separating the current Agora-web project into two distinct components."
AOSSIE - Australian Open Source Software Innovation and Education,Chirag Vashist,Optimization of Mind The Word,"I have selected the following ideas to implement in the extension :  

**1. Local Storage of most common words : ** Adding local storage for translations of the 1000th most common words will cover around 55% - 70% of all words encountered. This will save time as well as character limits.

**2. Adding Viewport limits :  ** Limiting the translation process to the current viewport will save time and character limits. 

**3. Translation without using API keys : ** Using Google Translate's free API for new users for easy on-boarding. 

**4. Better quizzing/testing features : ** On-the-go spontaneous quizzing feature will increase user interaction. Once the user has marked the word as ""learnt"", the word will be enabled for this feature.

**5. Improving basic UI/UX of the extension : ** Adding HoverCards for viewing translations, adding controls to Pop-Up page, Adding Interactive Tours, Changing UI/UX of Options Page and Adding Badge to Pop-Up for displaying information"

AerospaceResearch.net,Pedro12909,Universal Space Operation Center GUI,"# The Problem
The Universal Space Operations Center is a simple and easy-to-use ground station for space projects. It was initially developed to aid students in their space experiments. Since no experiment is the same, there was a need to create an application that adapted to each project’s needs. In it’s current state, the user has to use a configuration file to state what protocols/variables/graphs he is going to use during his experiment. However, the need to change the application’s layout is evident, and the student should not be forced to close the ground station, change the configuration file again, and re-open the application to resume his experiment. This goes against the initial principle of the groundstation.
# The Solution
There needs to be a way for the user to quickly and easily adapt the groundstation to his experiment, without having to worry too much about it. The goal of this project is to implement a set of new features that allow the user to manipulate the Ground Station’s data and layout. In order to accomplish this, I plan on creating a tool that allows the end user to specify exactly how he want his station to look and work."

- calculus operations like integration, differentiation (including partial diff.) 
- multivariable equation simplification
- solving equations like polynomial equations and inequalities, and multivariable linear equations

I also intend to improve the GUI of VisMa and create modules which will help the user to interact with graphs/plots."
AerospaceResearch.net,Vinay C K,[gsoc18-a-dd6] DirectDemod: Decoding of Automatic Picture Transmission (NOAA),"One of the important functions of satellites is to provide us with weather data allowing us to properly plan and be prepared for adverse weather conditions. Major users of such data are fishermen or sailors. They need to know the positions of dangerous storms, hurricanes etc and allow them to move away from them. Generally, the weather images can be downloaded from the internet, but the ships rarely have an internet connection. Hence for this, one of the solutions is that NOAA weather satellites freely send the weather images and data down to earth continuously. This is perfect for us, the users can simply have a simple and cheap RTL-SDR device and capture this freely available weather data. Currently, this is possible, but there are no opensource tools that come with the complete package. Usually, one software is used to capture and demodulate FM and then the decoded audio is fed into the other software to decode the image. This complex procedure needs a human's manual input and the raw IQ file may be lost in the process. This project intends to solve this. The open source tool that will be developed will have all the required functionalities."
AerospaceResearch.net,perezhz,"Turning orbitdeterminator into a robust, reliable tool","As a GSoC project, I will continue the work done on  *orbitdeterminator*, so that we turn it into a robust, reliable tool, suitable for orbit determination of satellite, spacecraft and Solar System small-bodies. As part of a comprehensible test suite for orbitdeterminator, I will take data from JPL's radar astrometry database as well as Minor Planet Center's optical database in order to test orbitdeterminator output vs known orbits computed from radar and optical observations.

The specific goals I will pursue during GSoC 2018 are:

- Turn orbitdeterminator into a robust tool for orbit fitting, taking into account relevant physical effects into orbit model (e.g., non-gravitational accelerations).
- Add interpolation features.
- Add a test suite, with varied and meaningful test scenarios, as well as having continuous integration (CI) and code coverage online tools working for the GitHub repo.
- Test orbitdeterminator for Solar System small-bodies such as NEAs, taking raw data from JPL's radar astrometry and Minor Planet Center's optical data, and then comparing output to other solutions for NEAs.

Bonus:
- Design and implement an elementary multi-sensor multi-target system for the DGSN system."
Amahi,Chirag Maheshwari,Backend Improvements and New Feature Additions,"Amahi is a personal/home networking, storage and app server with features allowing users to access their files and apps remotely using android and ios clients. The current server client architecture works good but has room for improvements. The implementation of **HTTP/2 protocol** instead of the currently used SPDY/3.1 and HTTP/1.1 protocols would result in reduced latency and faster content downloading on modern clients. Also the addition of **caching mechanism** for the proxy server will reduce the data passing through the proxy server to a great extent. The main focus in this proposal is on improving the backend architecture and adding new features on the top like **secondary user login**, **friending** etc. and also addition of an app for the hda called **Amahi Sync** rewritten in golang. Other things include minor features, API addition and resolving bugs."

Amahi,sanjitchak,Amahi Express Install Disc,"I propose to build an Amahi Express Install Disc, powered by Fedora Server. In that, the user can install our Amahi Server without interacting with Command Line Interface (CLI).

The problem is that user doesn't like to use CLI. In this world of cutting-edge UI/UX interfaces, user abhors the CLI. So, I will add a module in the Installation Process, to setup Amahi Server where the user will need to type their Installation Code and server ID to setup server. 

Here, Anaconda GitHub repository and documentation for developing Anaconda addons along with documentation for Kickstart file will be used a lot. Anaconda parses Kickstart file to run any third-party python modules or addons to customize the installation process. I will develop these addons so that user will only need to input their login and password in the CLI to access the server."

The SMS/Email Notifications service would be a microservice developed on Apache Fineract CN to enable MFI members to get notified on events occurring on their accounts. There are arrays of events occurring in other microservices therefore there is a need to streamline these events and notify MFI members of significant events. This will impact the KYC of the organisation and the user experience. This problem has led to the need for a microservice such as this one to be developed to enable MFI staff to select notifications which need to be sent or the member choose specific events during account creation.

So far, expanding functionality has been the focus of Beam SQL so there is little known about performance - we know only that it is a pretty straightforward mapping from SQL to Beam that should work OK a lot of the time. It would be interesting to see where the bottlenecks are when these SQL benchmarks are translated via Beam SQL into a Beam pipeline and then again translated to the native capabilities of e.g. Spark and Flink."
Apache Software Foundation,Karan Kotabagi,Integrate NextCloud for Apache Airavata's Data Transfer Use Cases,The goal of this project is to design and implement a Nextcloud module and replace the existing transfer of the files from the client applications via Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) with the APIs of this module. The existing protocols to transfer the uploaded files via client application window differ from each other and run in different ways to establish the connection and transfer the files. The existing mechanisms involve the HTTP and SFTP in order to transfer the files from the client window. To effectively enable the unified mechanism and collaboration of the files with the quick and reliable way we plan to implement the file upload using Nextcloud API. The APIs of the Nextcloud will be targeted in order to transfer the files from the client window and save the files to the Nextcloud. The Nextcloud enables the developers to reliably establish and support an unified mechanism to transfer the files from different clients running on the different platforms.

Airavata has evolved significantly and currently it only supports single job submissions through Orchestrator. But the current development version is being built-over Apache Helix for DAG orchestration. This provides an opportunity to resurrect workflow capabilities in Airavata. This GSoC project consists of the following sub tasks.

- Finalizing the Airavata Workflow Language.
- Modifying the Orchestrator to parse user-defined workflow and translate to equivalent Helix DAGs, execute the workflow, and monitor it at runtime.
- Developing a simple GUI to demonstrate the capabilities."

Apache Software Foundation,ssirowa,GSOC 2018 SpamAssassin Statistical Classifier Plugin,"Apache SpamAssassin is an Open Source anti-spam platform giving system administrators a filter to classify email and block ""spam""(unsolicited bulk mail). Presently SA uses Bayes Classifier together with some additional DNS filters to check for spam. 
The Bayes Classifier Approach used can run into problems like 'Bayes Poisoning' where using some legitimate ""ham"" words used in a Spam email can decrease the effectiveness of the Model. Also The learning rate of spam classifier using Naïve Bayes as machine learning algorithm is low as it depends on probability model to learn.
I’m proposing to build a statistical classifier plugin that will include various supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms with the focus being on neural nets, SVM(Support Vector Machines), HMM(Hidden Markov Model). 
The user can activate any number of models of the plugin and overall filtering will be done based on the combined scores of the active models of this plugin. This is in accordance to the fact the some algorithms work better than the others in different situations. The user can select what all models does he want to activate."

Knowing several languages, I know that it could be hard to recall some rare word and it is easier to translate from French to English and only then to Russian - because I forgot the word-pair between Russian and French. This graph representation works just like my memory: we cannot recall what is this word from L1 in L2. Hmm, we know L1-L3 and L3-L2. Oh, that's the link we need. Now we know L1-L3 word-pair. So, as we work on *** natural*** language processing, let's use ***natural*** instruments and systems as well.

The main benefit of this project is reducing human labor and automatization of part of the dictionary development.
1. Finding lacunae in created dictionary
2. Dictionary enrichment based on algorithm that offer variants and evaluation of these variants.
3. A potential base for creating new pairs.

List of main ideas:
1. Classes to create the most appropriate type of information
2. Work with subraphs (connectivity components) to reduce the complexity of calculations
3. Filtration algorithms
4. Vectorization to increase efficiency
5. Develope different metrics to reach quality of translation"
Apertium,Marc Riera Irigoyen,Adopting the unreleased Romanian-Catalan pair and upgrading other pairs to the monolingual module system,"Currently there are no machine translation systems offering direct translation between Romanian and Catalan available to the general public. English is commonly used as a pivot language, and the results are sometimes worse than what could be achievable with direct translation, because the two languages have a lot of common (both being Romance languages). In addition, many of Apertium's pairs (including an alpha Romanian-Catalan pair) have not been upgraded to current project standards, which makes present and future development or updated harder.

ArduPilot,Ayush Gaud,Mapping and Planning for obstacle avoidance,"Autonomous waypoint navigation has been an integral part of the Ardupilot project for a long time. This approach works well when the multicopter is flying at high altitudes without obstructions. In case of low altitude flights though, it becomes difficult for the drone to navigate autonomously and requires sensors to restrain it from colliding with the obstacles around. This is done by locally dividing the regions around the multicopter into sectors and scaling the attitude proportional to the distance from obstacles. This would sometimes lead to the vehicle to stop and a manual intervention would be required to let it out of the obstruction.
 
Situations like these could be avoided if a planning algorithm could take advantage of the observations made previously in the form of a 3D map and use it to direct the multicopter in the collision free path maintaining the global plan for waypoint navigation. This could be done by building a framework for mapping which would utilize depth information from stereo cameras or lidars and generate an occupancy map. The planner would use this map and global plan as an input and generate control commands for the multicopter to navigate autonomously."

Beam Community,Anshuman Chhabra,TensorflEx: Tensorflow bindings for the Elixir programming language,"Currently, there is a lack of machine learning tools and frameworks for Elixir. With the number of programmers learning/using machine learning only set to grow, supporting machine learning capabilities is _essential_ for any programming language. Moreover, there are discussions on elixirforum.com regarding this and recent talks given at ElixirConf that reflect the need for Elixir to provide machine learning capabilities.
I thus propose to work on _TensorflEx_,  an Elixir framework similar to _Keras_ (for Python). Keras uses _Tensorflow_ as a backend for doing all the ML. Using Native Implemented Functions (NIF) and the Tensorflow C API as a backend, a low-level wrapper will be written in Elixir. This low-level API will then be used to write a Keras-like framework in the form of a high-level API. This will allow Elixir developers to write expedient and efficient machine learning code in Elixir."

Beam Community,njichev,Elixir Idea #1: Typespecs to StreamData generators,"### Project Description

[StreamData](https://github.com/whatyouhide/stream_data) is a library that adds
data generation and property-based testing to Elixir. The goal of this project
is to read `@type` declarations from BEAM code and automatically get generators
out of them. Once that is done, we should use this information to automatically
validate `@spec` annotations with data generators.

#### Goal 1 - Getting data generators out of `@types`

First part - Provide a simple way to generate all simple types(int, atom,
all, etc.).  Maybe a way to compose different generators and getting new ones
would be useful for union/all types.  

Second part -  generators for recursive/co-recursive types and types with
arguments which will be a greater challenge.

#### Goal 2 - Automatically validate function `@specs`

If we have a function spec, we can automatically feed the function it's
arguments and check that the result always belongs to the return type of the
function.  

To check whether a result belong to the correct type generator, we should
probably extend the StreamData struct to include a member function as a
field. We would check whether different types belong to a data through it."
BeeWare Project,Patience Shyu,Optimizing the VOC Compiler,"The current implementation of Python AST to Java bytecode transpilation in many cases takes a naive approach, resulting in redundant bytecode instructions being produced and class files being longer than necessary. Not only does this make the code run slower than it should, this causes problems in some cases because the JVM enforces a [size limit](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.3) on class files, in particular on method sizes: each method must be less than 64KB.

Blender Foundation,Geraldine Chua,Further Development for Cycles' Volume Rendering,"Traditionally, solid objects are represented as meshes: a set of vertices, edges, and faces. This interpretation of real-life objects into 3D space is sufficient for typically solid media such as teapots and chairs. However, this model faces many issues when used to represent dynamic materials such as smoke or clouds, which have innumerable and constant shifts in number and location of vertices, edges, and faces. These types of objects are typically classed and implemented separately as Volumes.

Due to the nature of the materials involved, Volume rendering requires a different set of solutions in regards to data structuring, light sampling, and so on. Quickly becoming an industry standard, OpenVDB is a Volume rendering framework developed by Dreamworks that sees wide usage throughout the graphics industry such as in Pixar's RenderMan and Houdini. It is known for its efficiency in handling sparse data sets and its wide range of filters, transformation operators, compositing tools, and many other features for the creation and robust manipulation of Volumes. Its integration into Cycles will surely further Blender's usage in the 3D graphics scene."
Blender Foundation,Leonardo E. Segovia,Implementing a Hair Shader for Cycles,"Realistic hair or fur is essential when creating a plausible virtual world.

(2011) and Khungurn and Marschner (2017) demonstrated it to not be energy conserving.

This project intends to upgrade Cycles’ hair shader to the aforementioned *Zootopia* shader by Chiang et al. (2016), by porting Pharr (2017)’s implementation.

Boost C++ Libraries,Laouen Belloli,Boost.Real project,"In the history of Computer Science, real numbers representation and data structures do not have a simple solution, numerical errors can be carried from one operation to the next and after several steps, the error may significantly increase. Also, irrational numbers representation as the number π or e^π are not handled by the native number data types and causing limitations when calculations are based on those numbers. The problem can be summarized as: there are an infinite amount of different numbers and a finite representation system. Even if there are some existing solutions, there is not a modern C++ open source library to attack the problem and Boost C++ could be the appropriated place.

Following the Real number representation introduced in chapter 2 of Oliver Aberth. Computable Calculus. Academic Press, 2001.

A packet is send via Gatekeeper to Grantor server first, which Grantor server will be sending back a Grantor decision packets, indicating that if the packets is malicious and it should be dropped or allowed.
The connections between Grantor and Gatekeeper is unencrypted and it is hard to distinguish if the packets are sent from the trusted devices, therefore, the system is vulnerable to spoofing attacks, which the decision packets can be faked, and wrong decisions will be executed by the Gatekeeper. To encrypt the connections, a set of public and private key will be generated on both Grantor and Gatekeeper. At the beginning of the runtime, the public key should be exchanged first, new symmetric key will be randomly generated and encrypted using opponent’s public key, the encrypted symmetric key will be sent to others and decrypted using its own private key.

CCExtractor Development,Saurabh Kumar M Shah,Improve the OCR subsystem,"The current text extraction system  of CCExtractor for burned in subtitles depends on the input parameters like `conf_thresh`, `subcolor`, `whiteness_thresh` etc which are rather arbitrary and might vary from one video to another. Also, the text localization algorithm gives terrible results in many cases due to inefficient detection of regions as text/non-text. The ticker text extraction feature must also be added to the current hardsubx system. There are some cases in which the DVB subtitle extraction gives poor results. 

The goal of this project is to implement  a text localization and binarization pipeline which is independent of any input parameter(other than the video file). This localization algorithm would also improve the OCR results and the classification of the frames into text and non text regions would become efficient. This project also aims at adding tickertext extraction feature to the current hardsubx system. The DVB subtitle extraction causes noise to be generated on the text regions and an additional filtering step needs to be added to improve the results in the case of DVB subtitles too."

This algorithm has a lot of potential owing to the fact that it can generate data that is quite similar to the data given for learning in addition to faster generation of samples when compared to fully visible belief nets. It therefore makes GANs immensely useful in simulation of particle physics and astrophysical data.

CERN-HSF,Ayoub Chouak,Modular YAMPL,"Modular YAMPL
=============
The project fundamentally consists in developing a flexible plugin system that allows YAMPL to selectively load essential components at runtime. This makes YAMPL extremely modular and decoupled from the IPC backend modules, making it easy for anyone to add new backends or edit the existing ones without compromising the core YAMPL code. 

In addition to the plugin system, the project proposes an overhaul and development of a python binding generation procedure which allows for continuous generation of the bindings whenever the core code is modified. The ultimate goal of the project is to make YAMPL more flexible, modular and extensible.

How is Modular YAMPL possible?
-------------------------------------------------------
- An ABI-agnostic plugin middleware handles the runtime dynamic loading of the plugins, the communication between the YAMPL core code and the plugin as well as the marshalling of data. This system is designed with simplicity in mind and aims to be as **solid** and **reliable** as possible.
- A specifically designed open-source library ([PyBind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11)) allows for seamless operability between C++11 and Python. This allows for an easy generation of the python bindings for all the core YAMPL primitives and data structures."

CERN-HSF,Yash Saboo,Browser Extension for Rucio,"Rucio is a data management system for modern large-scale scientific experiments. One important feature that is still missing, is the ability of downloading datasets with minimal effort. Datasets are logical collections of files and are a common way of structuring data in Rucio. Although it is already possible to download single files through the web interface, to download a dataset the user would need to manually download file after file. The need of authentication to the storage system using certificates further complicates the process and for a single file download the certificate has to be selected for each download separately. Thus, the solution is to create web browser extensions, which will handle the authentication and automatically download the selected files of a given dataset.
Thus, this project aims to develop a browser extension which will achieve following objectives - handle metalink files generated by the Rucio backend, handle authentication, automatically download the selected files of a given dataset and do automatic failover if multiple replicas are reported in the metalink."

During simulation, Allpix-Squared run events that contains a series of modules that operate on input data — usually in the form of a previous module’s output data. These events aim to mirror the behavior of a particle interacting with a specific detector hardware. Some modules are independent of others, so they can be run in parallel; this is the current state of the multithreading used in the framework, but it does not make good use of available CPU cores. The aim of this proposal is thus to run full events in parallel instead, greatly enhancing CPU core utilization. This however requires some internal restructure and presents new problems not shared with the current approach, such as the issue of event execution order. I aim to solve this issue with dependency graphs. When done, the new multithreading approach should allow better execution time, independent on core count and simulation parameters."

Also included with the proposal is personal information regarding my academic background and my commitment with CGAL."
CGAL Project,Tong ZHAO,Spectral Surface Reconstruction,"This project aims to build a package for reconstruction watertight surfaces from un-oriented point sets. The first step is to estimate un-oriented normals to the inferred surface by combining Voronoi diagram and Principal Component Analysis. It results in a tensor field which encodes both the normal direction and the confidence in the approxiamtion. The second step is to estimate a implicit function such that its gradient is best aligned with the principal axes of the tensor field encoding the normal directions. This estimation could be viewed as a generalized eigenvalue problem, which can be solved by the power iteration."
CGAL Project,Vasudha Varadarajan,Smooth Surface Reconstruction,"The current implementation of Poisson Surface Reconstruction algorithm in CGAL constructs a continuous, piecewise linear implicit function, i.e. it is only C0-continuous.

The multi-label output of the classifier would be specifying both the polarity and the sentiment of given tweet. A number of models will be tried and tested, including LSTM RNNs or Gradient Boosting Machines."
"CLiPS, University of Antwerp",Maja Gwozdz-1,Sentiment analysis of figurative language in political tweets,"I aim to develop a sentiment analysis sub-tool for classifying the polarity of political tweets containing figurative language (most likely idioms and fossilised metaphors). From a linguistic perspective, figurative language is hugely prevalent in tweets: it is concise, catchy, and gets the point across. From a computational perspective: idioms and metaphors and notoriously difficult to classify due to their heterogeneous nature. However, careful annotation and methods like the MWE tokenizer (NLTK) can successfully tackle this challenge."

The idea is to do variational inference on this distribution using reinforcement learning. In order to understand the feasibility of using reinforcement learning to the problem, agents are tested against stochastic processes that resemble population genetics. Practical evidence is validated to provide a sanity check on the feasibility of deployment of such a method in practice in large-scale problems of population genetics. The next step would be to analyze how these methods actually performed in the population genetics problem and gain insight into the stochastic process that generates the distribution."
Canadian Centre for Computational Genomics,Ruijian An,Efficient frequency spectrum computation over large sample sizes,"The goal of the summer project is to revise the current implementation so that it can compute large frequency spectra efficiently. As a result, various inference can be carried on huge sample sizes at a reasonable computation cost. The idea is to track a small subset of entries in the full frequency spectrum and interpolate to recover the full AFS to proceed with integration for larger sample sizes. The key problem is how to recover the frequency spectrum accurately, so several experiments would be carried out to tune parameters and implementations. Also, a framework is expected to be developed for balancing the trade off between computational complexity and data recovery accuracy, that is, deciding which kind of data should be computed with approximation and which should be computed directly."
Catrobat,Gajendra Tanwar,Google blockly integration to catrobat project,"Google Blockly is a library for building visual programming editors.It is increasingly being used as a platform for visual programming languages such as Scratch 3.0, AppInventor, and code.org.  

Current Situation: Catrobat bricks used in scripts that are manipulated in the IDE part of Catroid and Catroweb, all use our own visualizer. 

Proposal:
We want to use the Scratch variant of Blockly to display Catrobat scripts and bricks in a webview.we will follow a two-step implementation process with fixed primary goals in each step.

1: The passive script preview on the sharing platform of Catrobat (Catroweb) will use Blockly instead of the current code base. One important issue that needs to be addressed is to use the correctly translated strings (localization, including for right to left languages such as Arabic).

2: This visualization of bricks shall also be used in a review in Catroid as an alternative way to display scripts and blocks, on an infinite virtual plane. it will be possible to switch back and forth between the read-only Blockly view and our current view of the scripts.

Extended goal: ability to keep the important Blockly code for repeatedly indefinitely use in the future."
Catrobat,Poppy,iOS: Device Sensors and Code Refactoring,"Device sensors have different ways of functioning, depending on the operating system. This being stated, I will improve the existent code by calculating the values at which the sensors should be initialised and their range area. In order to do this, I will test a multitude of possibilities and check the results, until I find the most suitable one in order to make the projects behave in the same way both on Android and iOS. I will use iOS native sensors, understand how they work and get the most of their functionality in order to improve the existing code. 

Additionally, I would create a framework for the sensors used in iPhones and add some general functions to help me throughout the development of the project, but also to help other developers work with sensors better. This will allow me to modularise the code and improve its readability. In the end, I would refactor the code to make it as readable and organised as possible, so it can become easy to be maintained by other contributors in the future.  Also, for every progress I make throughout the project, I will create some mock examples to test its functionality and discover new ways to improve it, such as edge cases."
Catrobat,Thomas Hirsch,"Refactoring - Testable code, simplify existing unit tests, enhance test coverage","Theres about 1100+ occurences of “.getInstance()” methods accessing singletons from all over the project. (eg. ProjectManager, StorageHandling, Backpack, SensorManager, etc.) Most of those “God Objects” sometimes exceeding 2000+ LOC, and having way too many responsibilities and functionality, therefore pose a major problem for testing. Lots of business logic is currently untested, or tested via UI since so many of those nearly unmockable God Objects are used there. To remedy this, those classes should be broken up into smaller classes with a clearly defined responsibilities, as well as their usages reevaluated and refactored as well. Existing unit tests are to be refactored and new tests of formerly hard to test parts are to be written.
A good example is the Formula object in catrobat, since it is pure business logic, but currently calls a number of singletons and needs a context which can be refactored quite easily and have unit tests put in place."
Catrobat,Thomas S,Integrate Pocket Paint into Pocket Code,"During the Google Summer of Code I would like to integrate Pocket Paint into Pocket code.
There is quite some refactoring overhead before this can be done, as Pocket Paint currently makes use of antipatterns (e.g. Singletons) and global static variables that will become a problem when merged with Pocket Code.
Some features are identical in both applications (language chooser) which can be dropped and reused ."
Catrobat,Thomas Schranz,Introduce Architecture and Separate Components,"An open source software project should allow everyone to participate. Inherently this can cause the project to grow over the boundaries of its initial scope rapidly.

CiviCRM LLC,Alexander Sludds,CiviCRM Extensions for Political Campaigns,"CiviCRM is a great CRM for the needs of many non-profits, such as the NLG. A friend of mine suggested that CiviCRM has many features that campaign staff would use for political campaigns. He suggested two things that CiviCRM lacks that keep it from being competitive with other CRMs  like NGPVan or NationBuilder: 
* the ability to ""cut turf"" (i.e., select groups of contacts on a map to be assigned to a canvasser)
* integration with a mobile canvassing app to allow canvassers to add information to CiviCRM contact fields.

This summer, I would like to work towards both of these goals. I think that the first goal --- making a ""turf cutting"" extension for CiviCRM using Leaflet --- is a good baseline goal for the summer. I have a prototype that communicates with CiviCRM using the REST APIs, so it's in reach.

The second goal --- integration with a mobile canvassing app --- is a stretch, but worth working towards too. I've been rewriting the open-source canvassing app, Field The Bern, to be independent of Bernie infrastructure, and think it's a great candidate for CiviCRM integration. If time permits, I'd like to work on a CiviCRM extension to integrate with phones running Field the Bern."

This project will create an extension that allows organizations to easily import data from external endpoints which are compliant with the OSDI API.

Organizations would be able to supply an endpoint URL and an APIKEY through this extension when importing contacts, people, events, allowing them to quickly pass data between heterogeneous sources. Additionally, this project consists of an OSDI library that empowers developers to easily access OSDI-compliant datasource and read existing database data in OSDI-compliant JSON format.

CiviCRM has multiple import functions in extensions and core functions that allow users to import csvs of volunteers, people, events, contacts, etc. This project would also add options to import data through the provided extension."
CiviCRM LLC,Saurabh Batra,Machine Learning for Fraud Detection,"Detailed version: https://lab.civicrm.org/community-team/gsoc2018/issues/2

**Synopsis**

The project aims to build a new open-source fraud detection system for WMF. The 2 major steps involved are:

    * experimenting with various anomaly detection techniques to figure out which one provides a required balance of precision (% of detected frauds which are actually fraudulent) and recall (% of all frauds detected);
    * providing the technique as an independent web service to WMF (like ORES) which can entertain requests to ascertain the authenticity of transactions.

**Stretch Goals**

    * The web service uses the feedback from its decisions (new correct detection/wrong detection corrected by a human) to train the underlying model, improving its accuracy in the future.
    * Use something like LIME to provide a justification as to why our classifier chose to mark a transaction as fraud.
    * CiviCRM extension to interface directly with the web service."

It provides a uniform way of building and running containers for any required services, making sure that the application performs the same regardless of the target environment."
Classical Language Toolkit,Andrew Deloucas,The Road to CDLI’s Corpora Integration into CLTK: an Undertaking,"This project focuses on integrating Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative (CDLI) corpora into the Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK). Currently, CLTK houses several functions developed by Dr. Willis Monroe; the difficulty in utilizing these functions is due to the variables having to be presented in a reconstructed normalized form of Akkadian, which is not how tablets are either written traditionally or stored by CDLI. The goal of this project is to enable CLTK to reconstruct a  normalized spelling out of CDLI’s ATF text and thus create data available for two fundamental uses: 1) allowance of individuals to learn and practice Akkadian with real and novel reading exercises; and 2) with further class development, be analyzed on a mass scale."

The proposed progress aims to extend the current functionalities of the Germanic family."
Classical Language Toolkit,james.gawley,"Expanding the CLTK with Synonyms, Translations and Word Embeddings","The CLTK features the most sophisticated algorithm available for lemmatizing classical Latin. Lemmatization is the process by which inflected word-forms are grouped together under their dictionary headings. This allows us to gather accurate word-usage statistics, analyze authorship, and model subject matter in classical corpora. However the CLTK lemmatizer is not currently able to identify synonyms for a given word, or suggest translations into other languages.

I propose to modify the existing CLTK lemmatizer to look up synonyms and translations for Latin and Greek. I will adapt CLTK’s unique ‘backoff’ approach to lemmatization in order to measure the probability of each possible synonym and/or translation for a target word given its context. Further, I propose to incorporate vector models for Latin and Greek based on word embeddings trained using the word2vec algorithm. Once synonyms, translations, and vector models are incorporated into CLTK, users will be able to perform cutting-edge tasks like sentence length document alignment. This will open new horizons for digitally assisted classical scholarship."

DBpedia,Bharat Suri,Complex Embeddings for OOV Entities,"The aim of this project is to enhance the DBpedia Knowledge Base by enabling the model to learn from the corpus and generate embeddings for different entities, such as classes, instances and properties. While we do this, it is imperative that these embeddings are able to accommodate the semantic relatedness between entities. This means that we are not limiting ourselves with just the similarity between words, instead we take a step further ahead to also define the relatedness between the vectors and thus the relation between the entities and the text. Therefore, to incorporate this measure of the semantic distance, we define a measure of descriptiveness of the class that these entities belong to. Entities belonging to a class that has a very high level of description must have very low semantic distance in our model. Eventually, we extend the usability by predicting embeddings for out-of-vocabulary entities as well, and also extract relations between those entities using approaches that have been previously used for link prediction tasks in machine learning."

Statistical NLP techniques for information retrieval rely heavily on lexicon/words in an article rather than its categorization (contents in a TOC); by expressing TOC as RDF we will create a more powerful way of searching within and across articles. Standard metadata representation i.e. RDF implies less resource intensive task of partial reuse across applications.

This generated TOC RDF graph visualization can help in exploring multiple Wikipedia pages for hidden semantic links. It improves the horizontal scalability i.e. ease of updating, deletion, and the addition of new RDF triples."
DBpedia,Sachin Malepati,Fusing the List Extractor and the Table Extractor,"Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia having humongous amount of information. Lots of information are stored in form of lists and tables. So, there is a need to extract these data and store them appropriately for developing a knowledge graph. As wikipedia pages can be edited by anyone, no proper structure is followed while editing/creating the pages. For extracting proper data from lists and tables, two separate projects were developed. One for extracting data which are present in the form of lists and another for extracting data present in form of tables. These projects have different work-flows and employ different methods for extracting the information. So, the main objective of this project is to develop a single project which can extract lists data and tables data from wikipedia articles. We need to combine both the projects to form a unified extractor."
DBpedia,Tarun S R,A Neural QA Model for DBpedia,"Traditionally a QA System over linked-open data performed 4 key tasks with a Natural Language Question. They are Named Entity Recognition,Named Entity Disambiguation,Relation Extraction and Linking and Query Building.The Query Builder tries to build the query using the entities and relations extracted and linked by the NED and REL Components.The Query generated was used to query the Knowledge Base to retrieve the answer. However, recent studies[“Why Reinvent the wheel-Let’s build Question Answering Systems together”] show that by using different components for different tasks, there is a significant drop in the global values of Precision and Recall on standard QALD and LCQuAD datasets.Efforts have been put up to try and generate the SPARQL query directly from the Natural Language Question by removing the intermediate steps of linking entities and relations.The paper “SPARQL as a foreign language” attempts to use an LSTM model to perform Machine Translation of NL queries to SPARQL. I aim to build on this work and extend the NSpM to cover more classes of DBpedia to enable high quality QA.This enables the users to make use of the huge data available using Natural Language effectively."
DBpedia,Víctor Fernández Rico,Web application to detect incorrect mappings across DBpedias in different languages,"The DBpedia mappings for each language are not aligned, causing inconsistencies in the quality of the RDF generated. This is often a consequence of the volunteers that create the mappings, because it is a manual process and can be biased by the mother tongue of the author.

In this proposal I present my work plan to create a Web Application and API to aid in detecting automatically these inaccurate mappings.

The backend API will be based on a combination of the previous work presented by M. Rico and N. Mihindukulasooriya and my own research proposal based on graph embeddings."
Debian Project,Alexandre Viau,Automatic Packages for Everything,"Many packaging tasks can be automated, and are likely to succeed without any human intervention:
- creating a backport for Debian stable from a packaging in Debian testing
- upgrading a package to a newer upstream version
- packaging a simple Perl, Python or Ruby using one of the tools listed on AutomaticPackagingTools

However, doing those tasks still require Debian packaging knowledge.

As a step towards Debian's world domination, it would be great if we could automate those tasks and provide ready-to-use Debian packages, so that users are left with a deb-based alternative when there are no packages for their needs in Debian itself, instead of using upstream packages or building from source. **The goal of this project is to experiment with the idea of a service that would distribute unofficial Debian packages for the above scenarios.**

Typically, that service would deal with:
- determining which packages should be generated
- generating those packages
- using several methods to detect problems (e.g. piuparts, autopkgtest tests)
- publishing them"

Debian Project,Sergio Alberti,Reverse Engineering Radiator Bluetooth Thermovalves,"Radiator valves have become increasingly important in recent years, especially in some countries where they have been made mandatory by law. This led to the production of various models programmable using a smartphone application coupled with the BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) protocol. At the moment all the products on the market use proprietary communication protocols to exchange essential data with the application, making it difficult to integrate this devices into external open-source projects. For this reason the University of Milan has successfully reverse-engineered a protocol and released the necessary code to use it with a _GPL_ license.

This project aims to start from the released library, written in shell scripting, and **port it to a more modern language**. In particular, the result should lead to the creation of a **reverse-engineering guide** as general as possible, a well documented **Debian package** and try to integrate it in ""domotics"" projects such as _Openhab_ or _Home-assistant_."

Debian Project,Yugesh Ajit Kothari,GUI app for EasyGnuPG,"In a world where data is always on the move, a lot of us pay very little respect to security and authentication. The extent of this awareness, especially in a country like India is alarmingly low. People have been slow to move out of their comfort zone and adapting to alien technologies is rarely something people want to consider. In this scenario, a GUI based software that provides an easy way to get people started with encrypting personal data, messages, is an important step - and I hope this project helps accomplish that.
As a shocking example - I recently travelled with a railway staff who was travelling roughly 900 miles just to deliver a letter from the Railway head office of India to a remote location office (on enquiry- ‘it could not go as a soft copy simply because it was confidential and required the “signature” of some senior officer as authentication’)."

Developers Italia,Costantino Carugno,Datastories,"Italian Team Digitale is building the first “operating system” of a country. One of the technologies that it has implemented is the Data & Analytics Framework (DAF) which consists in a huge stack (more than 6000!) of public datasets and tools to work with them. These datasets concern very important matters in organizing and providing good quality services
to citizens in diverse fields such as public health, education, transportation, finance etc. Unfortunately the data are not directly informative, they need to be organized, explored and analyzed; they have to be transformed in usable information that the public administration can use to improve its inner working and provide a better operational infrastructure.

Machine are helpful to look for human errors and inconsistency and speed up tracing by doing a first pass for human. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team has projects called Tasking Manager which enables volunteers, also known as mappers, to map areas, especially buildings and roads. It is used to aid disaster response and address local development challenges. For one mapping task, it might require 1000 hours of human volunteer time to map the features, e.g buildings.  It would be much more efficient to have machine learning detect and provide buildings suggestion and let the volunteer do the verification."
Digital Impact Alliance,Rodrigo Pontes,HOT: OpenMapKit Mapbox Vector Tiles Implementation and Polyline Editing,"OpenMapKit on Android currently utilizes MBTiles, a specification created by Mapbox for storing arbitrary tiled map data using SQLite, for its basemaps. This creates two problems: MBTiles add overhead, which decreases the app's performance; and MBTiles need to first be created and stored locally on the phone's external storage when preparing deployments if poor Internet connectivity is to be expected.
Furthermore, OpenMapKit on Android provides no means of editing map polylines, such as splitting them, through the app itself. This has to be done by adding a reference point in the app, then manually editing the back-end to split the road, to then add information about each new road, which is not only very inefficient but error prone.
As such, these two issues will be addressed throughout the GSoC period. The first issue will be fixed by allowing the app to read raw vector data (.osm files, which are XML based). To do so, the new Mapbox GL SDK will be used, since it uses Mapbox Vector Tiles instead of MBTiles. The second issue will be fixed by automating the editing process that is now done manually, providing the appropriate functionality in the app to do so."

In layman terms, the finished module would pull in latest product specifications, reviews and additional data selected by the customer, and import them into their Drupal site as nodes, without the hassle of manually updating product feeds, which can then be used by a customer according to his/her requirements. This would be due to the fact that the data would be directly imported from reliable and prominent affiliate networks such as Amazon and Flipkart, to name a few, through the affiliate link facilitated by the API, thereby tracking the referral link to a particular e-commerce platform’s site through a cookie or pixel."

Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP),Evandro Taquary,Recurrent Neural Networks applied in the time-series classification over a high resolution data,"The increasing number of sensors orbiting the earth is systematically producing larger volumes of data, with better spatiotemporal resolutions. To deal with that, better accurate machine learning approaches, such as Deep Learning (DL), are needed to transform raw data into applicable Information. Several DL architectures (e.g. CNN, semantic segmentation) rely only at spatial dimension to perform, for example, land-cover/land-use (LCLU) maps, disregarding the temporal dependencies between pixels observations over the time. Also, high-res remote sensing data (e.g. Planet, Sentinel) may provide more consistent time-series, that can be use in the identification of important LCLU classes, like crop, pastureland and grasslands.

This potential can be explored using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), a specific family of DL approaches which can take into account time dimension. A promising project idea would be implement a RNN approach (e.g. LSTM) to classify a Sentinel time-series that is able to produce a map for one or more LCLU classes and ship the final version of the model into the Pycoal library as part of the COAL project."

Eta,Mriganka B R Chowdhury,Purity and Nullability Analysis,"I propose to work on a tool that, given JVM bytecode, decides for each method, whether it performs an effectful computation (including IO, global variable mutation etc.), or it is referentially transparent, that is it yields the same result everytime it is called with same arguments. Such functions are called 'pure functions'. The tool is also supposed to provide information about whether the return type can be the special `null` value, requiring a `Maybe a` during Eta-interop. Automated analysis for such data can simplify the development process, by enabling an ffi-generator to generate bindings for Java , ideally without requiring any manual input from the developer. Since the project is mostly exploratory, the analysis is intended to be conservative, but never wrong, in the sense that it should not recommend a return type of `a` for a function that may return `null`, but may recommend `Maybe a` for a function that never returns `null`. But the aim is to, of course, minimize the number of such cases."

In the present implementation, we have transformed websites generated through open-event-webapp to be **Progressive Web App(PWA)**, due to which service workers are already enabled. Therefore we can now move to further enhancement like push-notifications of bookmarked events by any user, also we need to improve the user interface for the **dark theme** enabled recently to project. The present testing suite requires some more tests for the functionalities like direct linking of tracks and rooms so the aim is to write **mocha unit tests** with selenium webdriver for the recently added features and the proposed ones.

Also, the process of installing these bots are generally difficult to find as well as to implement. Some bots are not having appealing interface and are having incorrect documentation. New features such as games, todo lists, reminders, and platform specific functions such as subscribing to a particular channel, can be added to the bots to make them more useful. This project aims at making significant improvements in SUSI AI bots such as susi_slackbot, susi_gitterbot, susi zulip bot, susi_telegrambot, and others too, and make them ready to use in production."

The necessity of the device being used from an remote area or to simulate the functionality at a classroom without the physical device has arrived. Hence the PSLab-Remote platform. 
* The remote platform should give out a real experience to the user and the project proposed here would consist of a good virtual environment to arrange components and capture data from the PSLab. This is an upgrade to the existing web PSLab-remote platform since it only has the functionality of communicating with the device using python scripting. 
* A real world use case is to have a classroom virtual lab environment to test out the PSLab. Hence a the front-end web application will work as a web portal to connect teacher and student. Teacher can add tasks to be completed by the students. Later the sketches and results can be viewed by the teacher to measure the student learning outcomes."

There is no in house utility that comfortably links with the Open Event and Eventyay and provides the same services as the platform or more. The platform currently can do basic generation of badges but needs more features to become a better alternative to its competitors.

The proposed enhancements can be: 
* Improvement in the API Endpoint, for better connection with parent projects. 
* Implementation of Authentication using firebase
* QR Code generation for the badges and improvements in the CLI package to reformat the code structure 
* Improvements in the frontend.

The devmatch infrastructure gives us a way to match up hardware with kernel modules that implement drivers that claim the hardware. The problem is that the drivers need some modification before devmatch can use them. Specifically, they need to have their device ID scans done via a table, and that table needs to be decorated with a PNP_INFO tag so the compiler and kld_xref extract the metadata that devmatch needs to do this job. As the PCI drivers are all over the place in terms of how they match device IDs work will be needed to move some of the in-line code to tables, some of the tables lookups may be able to move to standardized routines, etc. Trimming GENERIC to show that the drivers work is also required.

GFOSS - Open Technologies Alliance,Ioannis Daras,Addition of Greek language to Spacy.io,"I propose the addition of Greek language in spacy.io and the implementation of an extra feature of sentiment analysis for the Greek language.
On the subject of the integration of Greek language to the spacy.io platform, I suggest the following metrics for the evaluation of the project: First of all, we should ensure that the model of Greek language passes successfully the language-independent ""tokenizer sanity"" tests provided by spacy.io . A second metric could be the performance of the model in language specific tests. Last but not least, we could evaluate the model in real world data offered by Official Greek Government's Gazette (FEK-ΦΕΚ) for named entities extraction and  document categorization as mentioned in the ideas list of GFOSS for GSOC 2018.
With respect to sentiment analysis, I would like to implement a binary classifier that, given a piece of text in Greek language, can computationally identify and categorize  the opinions expressed and more specifically to determine whether the writer's attitude towards the topic is positive or negative. The classifier will also return a polarity score which will serve as a measure of confidence of the classifier for its’ decision."

GFOSS - Open Technologies Alliance,Marios Papachristou,"Government Gazette text mining, cross linking, and codification Project","In the recent years plenty of attention has been gathering around analyzing public sector texts via text mining methods enabled by modern libraries, algorithms and practices and bought to to the forefront by open source projects such as textblob, spaCy, SciPy, Tensorflow and NLTK. These collaborative productive efforts seem to be a shift towards more efficient understanding of natural language by machines which can be used in conjunction with public documents in order to provide a more robust organization and codification in the legal sector.  
This proposal  aims to extend the existing **Government Gazette (GG)** text mining code by implementing features in order to organize and (cross)-link GG texts with legal texts and detect the signatories via heuristic and machine learning methods. This will enable elimination of bureaucratic processes and huge time savings for jurists who for example seek legal documents in the **ISOKRATIS** database of legal texts."
GFOSS - Open Technologies Alliance,Rosalie Wagner,Adding Greek glyphs to the open  source font Arima Madurai,"This project aims to extend the collection of fonts supporting Greek script in the Google Fonts Catalog. Indeed, today 35 typefaces supporting Greek script are available. Moreover, only 2 fonts are explicitly intended for display text. 

Arima Madurai is a font created by Natanael Gana and Joana Correia of NDISCOVER. It is a multiscripts display font with 8 weights from thin to black and have a strong calligraphic influence. It has a lot of personality so it can be recognisable in headlines or brand names uses. Regarding the history of Greek script, it is both interesting and challenging to design a typeface with a calligraphic feel: in terms of design but also in terms of study. 

Arima Madurai already supports Tamil, Malayalam and Latin scripts and I would like to add Greek extended script to the glyphset. The fact that the font already supports multi scripts is a real benefit to the project: Arima Madurai already acts in non latin typographic environment and therefore displays a large set of shapes that can be used to match the Greek glyphs with the other ones."

GNU Compiler Collection (GCC),HRISHIKESH KULKARNI,Textual Representation of LTO Object Files (Textual LTO dump tool project),"As far as I understand, the motivation for LTO framework was to enable cross-file interprocedural optimizations, and for this purpose an ipa pass is divided into following three stages:
1. 	LGEN
2. 	WPA
3. 	LTRANS
 
LTO byte code:
The LTO object file is a regular elf file with sections containing LTO byte-code. A LTO object file contains various sections for storing command line options, symbol table, global declarations and types, function bodies in GIMPLE, ipa pass summaries, ipa references, static variable initializers and the call graph.
There are couple of limitations of the byte code format:
1] It is not self descriptive, which makes it harder to debug.
2] The byte code is essentially a “serialized” version of in-memory representations, which makes it prone to break across versions.

The purpose of this project is to create a dump tool for easily analyzing LTO object files similar to readelf or objdump -d for regular ELF object files."

It was not created to be a free version of Matlab, however, it takes advantage of the well-known m-script languages and functions. Both Matlab and Octave presents many similar packages (also known as toolbox in matlab). One of the missing functions in this package is the [Control System Designer tool](https://www.mathworks.com/help/control/ref/controlsystemdesigner-app.html)  . This tool, also called siso tool, is used in Control System, Linear System, Modern Control class and many others. This tool has been used in courses related to control theory to teach students how to design linear controllers by interactive tools. Therefore, the students can add the controller to the plant interactively and configure it, such as, adding poles and zeros in the root locus diagram, or even add common controller types: PD, PID, Lead and Lag controller for example. The goal of this proposal is to create an **Interactive Tool for SISO Linear Control System Design** which is a missing feature in octave compared to Matlab and is significantly helpful for the students who are learning how to design controllers for linear plants."

To minimize the speed-accuracy trade-off of this feature, I plan to merge a 'trained' Neural Network with GNU Octave. This Neural Network would be trained to identify the correct spellings of the reserved words and inbuilt functions of GNU Octave, and the common typographic errors associated with them. After sufficient training, the network would be able to classify misspelled versions of the reserved words or inbuilt functions into a particular class. The 'class' being the correct spelling of the reserved words and inbuilt functions. It would then suggest something like ""Did you mean: <the class predicted>"" to the user."

GNU Project,Aniketh Girish,Adding support for DNS-over-HTTPS,"DNS over HTTPS is a web protocol that argues for sending DNS requests and receiving DNS responses via HTTPS connections, hence providing query confidentiality. DoH provides more than just privacy – it also helps guarantee the integrity of the response users receives to their requests. Because the DNS response is invisible between responder and user, ISPs and others in the end-to-end network chain can't interfere in the responses.

Henceforth, we provide a plan for a new implementation of a parsing DNS over HTTPS. In the process, we would create a new library to handle DNS resolution. Further, we provided added support for handling IPv4 and IPv6 DNS packets as well as support for EDNS. The integration with HTTP provides a transport suitable for traditional DNS clients seeking access to the DNS. In the end, our client will be capable of sending DNS queries and getting DNS responses over HTTP using https:// and implies TLS security integrity and confidentiality.

Furthermore, we plan to provide support for DNS Service Discovery which is a way of using standard DNS programming interfaces, servers, and packet formats to browse the network for services."

This was starting to be supported with alternative notation fonts, but creating an extension package for ""house"" style sheets can help this be achieved, allowing them to be created, applied, and shared modularly.
Using the notation-fonts package in openLilyLib as a base, I would be improving the loading mechanism for notation fonts within LilyPond as well as allowing different attributes to be loaded as a package, including text fonts, general sizes, score types, &c.

To pay with Taler, customers install an electronic wallet on their device. Before the first payment, the desired currency must be added to the wallet's balance by some other means of payment. Once the wallet is charged, payments on websites take only one click, are never falsely rejected by fraud detection and do not pose any risk of phishing or identity theft.
The goal of this project is to create a component that sits between the seller's frontend and the GNU Taler merchant backend. This component should have a web interface, where payment buttons or payment forms will be configured. Additional goals include inventory management, where the seller can configure the available stock for an item and will get notified when their stock runs low.  Currently, to accept payments with GNU Taler, people have to write their own code. What I propose to change is this mechanism. People will be able to communicate with the merchant’s backend via a simple API."

GNU Project,uniq10,guix - Continue rewrite build daemon in Guile Scheme,"This project will be the continuation of a GSOC-2017 effort with the same goal. Currently the build daemon of Guix is written in C++, inherited from Nix. It works fine but is not as hackable as we would like, and has poor integration with the rest of Guix. For instance, the daemon calls out to the 'guix substitute', 'guix authenticate', and 'guix offload' commands, but its interface to these commands is very limited. Furthermore, a large part of the daemon's code is already implemented in Scheme: container functionality is available with 'call-with-container', archive creation is implemented in (guix nar), writing derivation files (.drv) is done in (guix derivations), and so on.

The goal of this project would be to rewrite the daemon in Guile Scheme using the building blocks already available and also write the missing blocks in Guile Scheme. Important missing bits include the garbage collector and its scanner (which scans files for references to /gnu/store items), the scheduler, which schedules derivation builds in topological order, using the specified number of cores, etc."

"Genes, Genomes and Variation",Slava Suprun,Support for OpenStack cloud instances,"My suggestion is to create an OpenStack installation and an Openstack backend for eHive, this will allow:

1) run eHive pipelines in the OpenStack cloud.
2) allow eHive to manage the distribution of nodes.

Thus, the main goal is to directly call the OpenStack API from eHive, eliminating the need for a task scheduler. In addition, it is very important to develop your own solution for running eHive-pipelines in the OpenStack cloud. The cloud controller in eHive will be implemented in the same way. A cloud controller is one or more nodes that control cloud operations. Unlike cloud work nodes (for example, compute nodes), the cloud controller supports high-level representation of cloud resources and provides a single point for managing clouds. First, the user's request (for example, the launch of the instance) is included in the cloud controller node, and then, according to the request, it sends to other nodes (for example, calculate, store or network nodes) to complete the operation."

Identification of Gene Orthology Relation is the most important task of Comparative Genomics, as they tend to preserve similar molecular and biological functions. Thus if we can establish orthology relationships between two genes, we can obtain valuable evolutionary history of the two genes. However, with advanced sequencing depth and expansion in transcriptome data, genes are no longer the proper units for interrogation in functional conservation, evolutionary events, and expressional patterns, especially in the field of alternative splicing. As the accumulation of transcriptomic data, alternative splicing is taken into account in the assignments of gene orthologs and the orthology is suggested to be further considered at transcript level. Whether gene or transcript orthology, exons are the basic units that represent the whole gene structure; however, there is not much reported study on how to build exon level orthology in a whole genome scale. Therefore, it is essential to establish a transcription oriented gene orthology algorithm."

A lot of them are written in C, but a couple of them are shell or Perl scripts. This is the case of git-rebase--interactive (or interactive rebase), which is a shell script. Rewriting it in C would improve its performance, its portability, and maybe its robustness."
Git,Paul-Sebastian Ungureanu,Convert “git stash” to builtin,"Currently, many components of Git are still in the form of Shell or Perl scripts. This choice makes sense especially when considering how faster new features can be implemented in Shell and Perl scripts, rather than writing them in C. However, in production, where Git runs daily on millions of computers with distinct configurations (i.e. different operating systems) some problems appear (i.e. POSIX-to-Windows path conversion issues).

The idea of this project is to take “git-stash.sh” and reimplement it in C. Apart from fixing compatibility issues and increasing the performance by going one step closer to native code, I believe this is an excellent excuse to fix long-standing bugs or implement new minor features."
Git,prertik,Convert interactive rebase to C,"Many components of Git are still in the form of shell and Perl scripts. This has certain advantages of being extensible but causes problems in production code on multiple platforms like Windows. I propose to rewrite a couple of shell and perl scripts into portable and performant C code, making them built-ins. The major advantage of doing this is improvement in efficiency and performance.

Much more scripts like  git-am, git-pull,  git-branch have already been rewritten in C. Much more scripts like git-rebase, git-stash, git-add --interactive are still present in shell and perl scripts. I propose to work in git-rebase --interactive."

The first aim is to implement a vcf assembly checker which verifies that the reference base column in the vcf file matches those entries found in the reference genome. The other major objective is to benchmark and profile the vcf-validator. This should be used to look for code inefficiencies to be used to optimize the code for faster and more efficient execution.
Global Alliance for Genomics and Health,Sarbjit Singh,Simplify usage of VCF validation suite,"vcf-validator is a suite of command-line tools that can validate and fix VCF files. The goal of my project is to overcome the limitations of the validation suite that restrict its suitability for users with a less technical, more biological profile. I would perform the following tasks:

The suite is hard to compile for non-Linux operating systems. Gradually the user bases of Windows and MacOS X are growing, and a simple concise way of building the tool must be provided to the users. To accomplish this, I aim to simplify the build process for Windows and MacOS X.

Currently, the suite is completely terminal-based and can only read from and write reports to local files and needs to be installed and executed in the user’s machine. To deal with this, I aim to provide a network interface to run the suite as a service that would allow users to validate their own remote files, or a dynamically generated VCF stream.

If the input VCF is compressed, it is the user's responsibility to decompress it. My task is to reduce this extra step by making the validator itself capable of decompressing such files.

I would investigate how to insert checksums of reference genome sequences in the VCF header."

A Python client library along with an interactive command line interface tool to access Reference Server Data will be developed using TDD techniques.
Finally, a complete system test suite comprising of various functional and system tests of client-server architecture will be used to test end to end compatibility of every Reference Server with every client."
Godot Engine,Brandon Michael Makin,WebRTC into Godot & Peer-to-Peer multiplayer the Godot way,"Godot's high-level multiplayer approach makes it uniquely easy to create client-host and true peer-to-peer (P2P) models of multiplayer gaming.  However, outside of local area networks Godot struggles to actually create these multiplayer models because it lacks any sort of NAT traversal. I plan to implement WebRTC. The WebRTC standard will be able to provide support to Godot's existing multiplayer in making these sorts of peer-to-peer games.   
   
It will also make multiplayer viable in the HTML5 target platform, and allow for easy interfacing with non-Godot peers that use WebRTC.  Additionally, the support I build for WebRTC will make it easy to later add WebRTC MediaStreams, allowing for in-game voice chat.  (However, building MediaStream is less-often needed for games so is considered to be low priority and non-essential in my project. See project proposal for details.)"
Godot Engine,Daniel Matarov,MIDI support for Godot Engine,"The way I see MIDI working in godot would be to create another type of bus which handles MIDI data. It would probably work similarly to a sampler, by loading a sample library and assigning different sounds to corresponding MIDI messages. The user would be able to assign the midi messages to certain events in their game and when they get triggered the corresponding sample/sound will play. 
The sampler will essentially be creating something similar an audio bus for each sample and that bus will only play when a corresponding midi message is triggered. All of this will be contained in one track, which will also have all the signal processing features a standard audio bus."

Haskell.org,Alexandre Moine,Benchmarking graph libraries and optimising algebraic graphs,"A graph represents a *key structure* in computer science and they are known to be difficult to work with in functional programming languages. Several libraries are being implemented to create and process graphs in Haskell, each of them using different graph representation: Data.Graph from [containers](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers), [fgl](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fgl), [hash-graph](https://github.com/patrickdoc/hash-graph) and [alga](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs).
Due to their differences and the lack of a common benchmark, it is not easy for a new user to select the one that will best fit their project. The new approach of alga seems particularly interesting since the way it deals with graphs is based on tangible mathematical results. Still, it is not very user friendly and it lacks some important features like widely-used algorithms or edge labels.

Therefore, I propose to develop a benchmarking suite that will establish a reference benchmark for these libraries, as well as to enhance alga’s capabilities."

* Use cmov to improve simple branching code
* Use lookup tables over jump tables for value selection when useful.
* Enable expression of three way branching on values in Cmm code.
* Improve placement of stack adjustments and checks."

The goal of this project is to implement parallel AD in Haskell using the \verb|accelerate| library. If successful, the project will provide an asymptotic speedup over current implementations for many functions of practical interest, stress-test a key foundation of the Haskell numerical infrastructure, and provide a greatly improved key piece of infrastructure for three of the remaining areas where Haskell's ecosystem is immature."
Haskell.org,Chitrak Raj Gupta,Help Hadrian,"Current build systems such as “make” have a very complex structure and are difficult to understand or modify. Hadrian uses functional programming to implement abstractions to make codebase much more comprehensible. Build Rules are defined using Shake Library, and the results produced are much faster and scalable than current make based system. But the in-use implementation of Hadrian is still in development phase and not completely ready to be deployed. I believe that Hadrian will serve a huge assistance in increasing the productivity of Haskell developers. Therefore, the aim of my project will be to push Hadrian a few steps closer to deployment, so that the Haskell community can code with a bit more efficiency. 

A recent Pull Request by Alp Mestanogullary has implemented a basic rule for binary distribution. Also, I have been able to figure out multiple sources of errors causing validation failures, and my Pull Request has brought the number of failures down significantly. 

Hence, the major goals of my project will be to:
1) Achieve ghc-quake milestone that is listed in Hadrian.
2) Implement missing features in Hadrian.
3) Build a more comprehensive documentation of Hadrian."
Haskell.org,Francesco Gazzetta @fgaz,Support for Multiple Public Libraries in a .cabal package,"Large scale haskell projects tend to have a problem with lockstep distribution of packages (especially backpack projects, being extremely granular). The unit of distribution (package) coincides with the buildable unit of code (library), and consequently each library of such an ecosystem (ex. amazonka) requires duplicate package metadata (and tests, benchmarks...).

This project aims to separate these two units by introducing multiple libraries in a single cabal package.

This proposal is based on [this issue](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/4206) by ezyang."
Haskell.org,Gagan,Crucible: A Library for In-Memory Data Analysis in Haskell,"A typical workflow in interactive data analysis consists of :

* Loading data (e.g. a CSV on disk)
* Transforming the data

* Storing the result in some form (e.g. in a database). 

The goal of this project is to provide a unified and idiomatic Haskell way of carrying out these tasks. Informally, you can think of “dplyr”/“tidyr” from the R ecosystem, but type safe.
This project aims to provide a library with the following features:

1. An efficient data structure for possibly larger-than-memory tabular data. The `Frames` library is notable prior work, and this project may build on top of it (namely, by extending its functionality for generating types from stored data).
2. A set of functions to “tidy”/clean the data to bring it to a form fit for further analysis, e.g. splitting one column to multiple columns (“spread”) or vice versa (“gather”).
3. A DSL for performing a representative set of relational operations e.g. filtering/aggregation."

The algorithms that I plan to incorporate in the HIP package have vast applications in actual problems in image processing. Including these algorithms to the existing code base would help more and more users to really use Haskell while working on some computer vision problems and this would make Haskell (kind of) ahead in the race of with functional programming languages such as Elm or Clojure (since their image processing libraries are pretty naive).

However, compatibility with existing GHC features makes adding full-fledged dependent types into GHC very difficult. Fortunately, GHC has many phases underneath so it is possible to change one intermediate language without affecting the user experience, as steps towards dependent Haskell. The goal of this proposal is the replacement of GHC’s core language with a dependently-typed variant."
Haskell.org,Shayan Najd,Native-Metaprogramming Reloaded,"The goal is to continue on an ongoing work, utilising the Trees that Grow technique, to introduce native-metaprogramming in GHC.
Native-metaprogramming is a form of metaprogramming where a metalanguage's own infrastructure is directly employed to generate and manipulate object programs.
It begins by creating a single abstract syntax tree (AST) which can serve a purpose similar to what is currently served by Template Haskell (TH), and the front-end AST inside GHC (HsSyn). Meta-programs could then leverage, much more directly, the machinery implemented in GHC to process Haskell programs. This work can also possibly integrate with Alan Zimmerman’s work on compiler annotations in GHC, and enable a better IDE support."
Haskell.org,Simon Jakobi,Hi Haddock,"A long-standing issue with Haskell’s documentation tool Haddock is
that it needs to effectively re-perform a large part of the
parse/template-haskell/typecheck compilation pipeline in order to
extract the necessary information from Haskell source for generating
rendered Haddock documentation. This makes Haddock generation a costly
operation, and makes for a poor developer experience.

An equally long-standing suggestion to address this issue
is to have GHC include enough information in the generated `.hi`
interface files in order to avoid Haddock having to duplicate that
work. This would pave the way for following use-cases and/or have the
following benefits:

1) Significantly speed up Haddock generation by avoiding redundant work.

2) On-the-fly/lazy after-the-fact Haddock generation in cabal new-haddock and stack haddock for already built/installed Cabal library packages.

3) Add native support for a `:doc` command in GHCi’s REPL and editor tooling  (ghc-mod/HIE) similar to the one available in other languages (c.f. the Idris REPL or the Python REPL)

4) Allow downstream tooling like Hoogle or Hayoo! to index documentation right from interface files.

5) Simplify Haddock’s code base."

Suppose that we use the latest Hakyll that need a `pandoc-citeproc-0.13` which is missing in the latest stable Stack LTS. Stack ask us to add the extra dependency to solve this problem.

Haskell.org,Zubin Duggal,Making GHC Tooling friendly,"GHC builds up a wealth of information about Haskell source as it compiles it, but throws all of it away when it's done. Any external tools that need to work with Haskell source need to parse, typecheck and rename files all over again.

A unified high level interface means that a model can be configured easily and only once and then it can be deployed on all supported simulators. Different simulators provide diverse features and also might use various numerical approaches and approximations leading to possibly different results. Having an option to compare data from several simulators without extra work is a great feature PyNN offers.

GeNN is an efficient neural network simulator written in C++. The characteristic feature of this simulator is the ability to run simulation on GPU thus greatly decreasing required computational time.

Interfacing GeNN from PyNN would be a valuable acquisition for both projects. PyNN will have another, faster simulator at hand and GeNN will get a python interface. Python is much more widespread among the neuroscientists. Having such an interface will help to make GeNN more popular and hopefully will reduce the time scientists spent on their simulations."

It is clear however, that the brain is active even when the subject is not performing a task. In fact, according to certain estimates, task-related changes in neuronal metabolism only account for about 5% of the brain’s total energy consumption. Resting state fMRI is a comparatively newer approach used to identify synchronous BOLD changes in multiple brain regions while the subjects lie comfortably in the scanner without performing a task. The correlations between spontaneous BOLD signals can be used to study intrinsic functional connectivity. The analysis is also useful in situations where it is advantageous to explore the brain’s functional organization in neurological or psychiatric diseases. INCF currently has a tool to retrieve the hemodynamic response function at rest from resting state fMRI, however, the code is currently written in MATLAB. In order to increase its diffusion and portability, the repository has to be converted to Python and follow the BIDS - Standards to eventually create the portable neuroimaging pipeline."

set of images. These images can be acquired from studio conditions (controlled
environment), uncontrolled environment (hand-held devices), camera fitted on autonomous
robot, internet photos or video.

3D reconstruction allows the user to visualize a scene/ object, inspect details within them,
measure properties and reproduce in different material. Its applications include cultural
heritage preservation, computer games and movies, city modelling, e-commerce and 3d
object recognition/scene analysis.

final output quality and efficiency. Parallel approaches will be given priority, using OpenCL
for improved performance."
InterMine,Adrián Bazaga,InterMine Data Browser Tool,"The existing query builder in InterMine requires some experience to obtain statistical data about the different mine categories, which can become overwhelming for new users. For instance, for a user interested on searching data in HumanMine using it’s query builder, he or she would need to browser through the different classes and attributes, choosing between the available fields and adding the different constraints over each of them, in order to get the desired output. This requires the user to have a decent knowledge of the model schema in order to successfully build a correct query for the expected query results. For new users this workflow can become, indeed, overwhelming to search for specific information in the data.

For this reason, the goal of this project, is to implement a faceted search tool to display the data from InterMine database, allowing the users to search easily within the different mines available around InterMine. without the requirement of having an extensive knowledge of the data model."
InterMine,Aman Dwivedi,Cross-Intermine Search Tool,"Currently, we have around 30+ mines (and still growing) all around the globe. All mines have
their own separate APIs and their own separate portals. In order to search for a gene, a

JdeRobot - Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,Hanqing Xie,Personal for GSoC 2018 - JdeRobot-Academy: robot navigation using Open Motion Planning Library,"This project aims to build a ROS gazebo simulation framework to display robot navigation using OMPL. The framework include OMPL GUI, navigation node, obstacle plugin and robot model.

OMPL GUI should manage the navigation’s start or stop and set all the parameters such as robot type, start and goal pose and different OMPL planner. The tool can publish relevant message or subscribe service to change parameter.

Navigation receives configure from GUI node and obstacle information from gazebo. It calls the OMPL api and publish ROS path message. If the robot model is devoted to route, this node should update the new planning path based on new robot pose.

Although it just needs a known scenario in claim, I think it is convenience that we can change obstacle position freely. The gazebo plugin for obstacle can publish self-information or subscribe navigation’s service to change obstacle information.

When navigation node publish the Path message, a robot model and its path following function is needed to complete this motion. Conveniently, I will use robot models in the JdeRobot such as turtlebot and adrone.

Integrate all the above and implement the integral ROS gazebo simulation framework."
JdeRobot - Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,Jianxiong Cai,Create realistic 3D maps from SLAM algorithms,"# Goal:
This project (proposal) aims at implementing a complete system for creating realistic 3D maps from SLAM algorithms. In my proposed approach, it's highly related with offline-SLAM.
# Overview
Sparse online SLAM algorithms only produce sparse pointcloud, which is not ideal for the human. Surface reconstruction would produce more human-friendly maps. However, several issues need to be solved for performing surface reconstruction on real-time SLAM result. This includes globally optimize 3D points, enforcing smoothness,etc.

Besides, it's possible to solve the problem via an offline-SLAM approach (with surface reconstruction), because it's highly related with that.
# Specifications
The main part of this project is related to offline-SLAM, to compensate some trade-offs made by real-time SLAM for real-time consideration. This includes: 
- pose-graph optimization
- bundle adjustment
- enforcing smoothness
- surface reconstruction
- additional details about improving pointcloud accuracy

This project may combine several technicals used in state-of-art SLAM algorithm.

## Proposed Translation Layer
- A translation service(`translate.js`) will be built in lib-jitsi-meet i.e will run on the client side of the application which will initially make use of `Microsoft Translate Text API` will use the JSON messages received and provide accurate translation in real time. This will be sent back to `Chatroom.js` to send translated text to the MUC.
- UI for the settings panel required in the front-end part of the application will be developed and integrated by working with the `React` components. Subtitles with acceptable delay will also be seen here.
- A mechanism for delivering final transcript will be developed by storing the intermediate translated text and rendering once a meet gets over."

Getting all these done with this medium can be very cumbersome for System Integrators and for developers when testing just a very small thing on the Joomla! Installation. Added to all these problems is the speed in Access to perform these operations.
The Idea is to add a CLI Application to the Joomla! CMS, that can perform the updates without going to the administrative panel which:
* Provides basic commands needed to perform site wide administration
* Architecturally fits in into future releases(e.g Joomla! 4.x, 5.x, etc) of Joomla! as well as backward compatibility for

KDE Community,Ferencz Kovács,Plotting of live MQTT data,"Currently LabPlot has some support for the plotting of live data, which can be read from file/named pipe, TCP socket, UDP socket, local socket and serial port. 
The goal of this project is to provide support for the plotting of data received via MQTT protocol from a certain broker. LabPlot currently doesn’t provide any support for MQTT, even though it would be quite important for LabPlot to provide 
this kind of support, since it is a scientific data plotting software and MQTT protocol is widely used to transmit certain sensor data.

This project would increase LabPlot’s usability regarding analyses of scientific data, monitoring data collected by sensors, 
that is transmitted by MQTT protocol, or even make LabPlot usable in the field of Internet of Things or Smart Home Appliances.

 The project would involve extending LiveDataSource class, ImportFileWidget, LiveDataDock and AsciiFilter in order to
 set up a connection with a MQTT broker based on information provided by the user. Then LabPlot could receive and 
handle MQTT messages, save and plot the data transmitted by them. Already existing functionality for other types of

Because it is coded for Wayland, its backend is libinput but we also want to use that UI and its functionalities in X11 systems that use libinput so we need an abstraction layer. My goal involves porting the new Wayland-only touchpad UI to the X11 system. After the porting, I plan to improve the user experience for touchpad and mouse management by implementing new features like advanced scrolling behaviors and more granular speed and acceleration handling."
KDE Community,Gun Park,Port keyboard input modules to Qt Quick and expand scope to cover input method configuration for System Settings,"Users of Plasma Desktop Environment expect to find all their necessary system configurations through the System Settings application. So it plays an important role for the overall user experience of Plasma. But the current application is largely designed using the legacy QWidget framework, and does not meet the requirements for more responsive / modern design required for use in touch screens and mobile platforms. For that, it is necessary to port the KCMs to Qt Quick, which is quite tedious work and requires a lot of manpower. My primary goal is to help the KDE Community in this immense task, by porting the keyboard input modules, with modern designs provided by the KDE Visual Design Group (VDG).

Another additional goal is to integrate the input method configurations, such as ibus or fcitx, into the System Settings application. Currently, the only way to install / configure these input methods is to install it from a package manager and use the GUI provided by the input method, which is far from discoverable. The ability to add / remove and configure IMEs will improve user experience for a global audience."

KDE Community,Yingjie Liu,digiKam: Added the possibility to manually sort the digiKam icon view,"digiKam has the possibility to sort the items in the icon view according to different criteria, for example by: name, date, file size, rating etc. Many digiKam users have long been wishing to manually sort the icon view. The bug report (https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91562 ) now has more than 700 votes. The most efficient face recognition algorithm in digiKam is FaceNet which is implemented using neural networks. However, the speed of the algorithm is not as fast as the same implementation in dlib. One sufficient reason is that the code borrowed from dlib is not complete which makes the algorithm slow. The goal of this project consists of two parts: First, rearrange the sorting of items in the icon view by drag and drop. This sort must be stored in the database and must be retrievable like the other sort functions. Second, include dlib in digiKam source tree, and rewrite the code of face recognition using dlib in order to speed up the algorithm."

KDE Community,ivanyossi,"Optimize Krita Soft, Gaussian and Stamp brushes mask generation to use AVX with Vc Library","Krita digital painting app relies on quick painting response to give a natural experience. A painted line is composed of thousands of images placed one after the other. This image mask creation hast to be performed super fast as it is done thousands of times each second. If the process of applying the images on canvas is not fast enough the painting process gets compromised and the enjoyment of painting is reduced.

Optimizing the mask creation can be done using the AVX instructions sets to apply transformation in vectors of data in one step. In this case the data is the image component coordinates composing the mask. Programming AVX can be done using Vc optimization library, which manages low level optimization adaptable to the user processor features. However the data must be prepared so it optimizes effectively. Optimization has already been done on the Default brush mask engine allowing it to be as much as 5 times faster than the current Gaussian mask engine. 

The project aims to improve painting performance by implementing AVX optimization code for Circular Gauss, Circular Soft, Rectangular Gaussian, Rectangular Soft Rectangular and Stamp mask."

LEAP Encryption Access Project,C Shi,Improving traffic obfuscation capabilities of the Bitmask VPN,"As a component of the LEAP Encrypted Access Project, Bitmask VPN provides users with encrypted internet access and censorship circumvention capabilities. Network traffic between the users and Bitmask VPN providers located outside censored networks are encrypted and authenticated through the popular OpenVPN protocol, with traffic obfuscated by the Scramblesuit pluggable transport. Unfortunately, both OpenVPN and ScrambleSuit have been reliably identifiable by state censors without significant false positive penalties for several years. This highlights the need for an upgrade of Bitmask VPN’s censorship circumvention capabilities, which involves substantial development work that I intend to undertake, to make Bitmask’s obfuscation of OpenVPN traffic more effective, and to reduce engineering efforts required by future updates to the obfuscation implementation."

The aim of this project is:
+ The API to update the dominator tree and the post dominator tree using different strategies (lazily/eagerly) is fragmented. Therefore, a single class for abstracting away the tree update strategies and which trees are actually being updated need to be developed.
+ By implementing a single updater class, performing faster incremental updates will become possible. First, we can convert functions to update the data structure lazily. Second, we can use the updated dominator tree to prune unnecessary updates to the post dominator tree."

LabLua,Caio Messias,Development of a RCU Binding for Lua tables,"Lunatik is a programming environment based on the Lua language for kernel scripting. By allowing kernel scripting, a user may create scripts in Lua to customize their kernel to suit their needs. Modern day kernels, such as Linux, work on a highly concurrent environment, and therefore must use robust synchronization APIs to ensure data consistency, with each API having their own use cases. 

The Read-copy-update (RCU) is one of those APIs, made specifically for scenarios where data reading is much more common than writing. RCU allows concurrent readers to access protected data in a non-blocking way even during updates or removals. RCU, as with the rest of the Linux Kernel, is written in C.

The project idea is a binding of RCU for use in Lunatik, thus allowing synchronization of Lua data via RCU."

All DBMS provide an ‘EXPLAIN’ functionality for profiling. It describes how one query is executed, and suggests why the optimizer possibly decides to do so and why it could possibly be fooled by providing inferred and empirical data statistics. But MySQL has a ‘Optimizer trace’ function, which records the decisions of the optimizer and why it made such decisions. So people can know directly what the optimizer thinks from the output of the trace function, and don’t need to guess from ‘EXPLAIN’. MariaDB needs such a feature too."

This project aims at fully implementing end-to-end encryption in matrix-python-sdk, following 
the official implementation guide and making use of the Python bindings already present in libolm.

## Rationale

Currently, even though end-to-end encryption has landed in Matrix for over a year, only the three SDK upon which is built Riot on different platforms (JS, Android and iOS) ship with encryption. On desktop, this situation prevents writing clients, bots and bridges that can interact with encrypted rooms in any other language than javascript. Tackling this issue would benefit the matrix ecosystem by seeing more featureful projects emerge in a variety of languages (Python in this case). It also supports the Matrix long-term goal of having E2E encryption turned on by default in private rooms."

Now ListenBrainz also plans to generate data which could be used by MusicBrainz to show useful information like artist popularity. MusicBrainz has MBIDs (MusicBrainz-ID) associated with each artist, recording, and release. In order to provide MusicBrainz with the ability to access information based on MBIDs, we have to associate recording_mbids, artist_mbids and release_mbids to the listens where we can. For most of the listens we don’t have artist_mbids and relesae_mbids associated with them. But have recording_mbids associated with them. So, now I plan to associate MBIDs to MSIDs."

This is not very slow but there are a lot of requests per page on AcousticBrainz and with the XML web service it takes very long time to retrieve. 

Recordings in AcousticBrainz are stored based on their MBID from MusicBrainz. As accessing the MusicBrainz data in AcousticBrainz takes a long time to retrieve using present web API, we should be having a tighter integration with MusicBrainz data so that we can access the data in a faster and more efficient manner.

My proposal involves working on accessing MB database in AB irrespective of the present web service. 
With a direct access to MusicBrainz data, we can have a very tight integration with MusicBrainz database and can easily fetch MusicBrainz data and use it in many places in AcousticBrainz."
MetaBrainz Foundation Inc.,bukwurm,Importing data into BookBrainz,"This proposal is aimed at importing data into the BookBrainz database from third party sources, while at the same time ensuring that the quality of the data is maintained."
Metasploit,Albertor,Post-exploitation interface module to make it easy for  anyone anywhere,"In many cases once you have exploited a device you don’t know exactly what to do or how to go on. Maybe you have many payloads available and after trying all of them they don't work because of the architecture of the device. Even more in limited environments like embedded devices, for instance. The result is a waste of time and results.
Post-exploitation is a critical phase and that’s why I would like to create a generic interface to make it easy, automatic  and  direct  for  anyone  to  execute  postexploitation functions in whatever device they are trying to pentest. And it will not depend on the architecture of the device. 
At the same time I will try to make a project very scalable and modular to ease future improvements on it and avoid some of the current problems."
Metasploit,Eliott Teissonniere,Improving post exploitation features on POSIX systems,"As an IT student, I would like to take part in the GSOC 2018 by working on the **Metasploit Project**, the following proposal details the complete summer project I would like to work on during this upcoming summer.

This proposal targets the *“Improving the Post-exploit / Meterpreter functionality”* idea, more specifically the mettle payload targeting POSIX systems. My goals during the summer would be to improve the mettle implant by developing some post exploitation modules / extensions."
Metasploit,Rahul Dhawan,Improving the Post-exploit / Meterpreter functionality,"I want to contribute to the Metasploit Project by implementing one of the proposed ideas, namely “Improving the Post-exploit / Meterpreter functionality”. This implies enhancing the Meterpreter functionality by providing HTML based VNC style session control but accepting user input from the browser. Here is a catch, we can add all the Meterpreter functionality on HTML web page and simplify the session control interface for the users. As soon as user drops a Meterpreter shell, just by entering a single command, they will have an option to switch session control using Web interfaces or stay in command.
 
All the 64 functionalities will be displayed on the web interface. The user will select a particular command and implement the same within the web interface. This will also include streaming quality of audio as well as video and other fun behaviours."

Mobile Robot Programming Toolkit (MRPT),Karnik Ram R.,GUI App for Automatic Extrinsic Calibration of Range and Visual Sensors,"Range and visual sensors are being increasingly used alongside one another in mobile robots. With their increasing use,
calibration techniques that can accurately estimate the 6-DoF transformation between them are becoming increasingly important. In this regard, an end-to-end application with an easy-to-use graphical user interface for the extrinsic calibration of different types of sensors is proposed. The app will be able to calibrate the extrinsics of 3D LiDARs, RGB-D cameras, RGB cameras, and any combination between them. Automatic and target-less calibration algorithms based on line matching, plane matching, and trajectory matching will be implemented and integrated into the app. The user will be able to directly visualize the calibration results inside the app and also compare different algorithms wherever possible, and significantly reduce calibration efforts."
Mobile Robot Programming Toolkit (MRPT),Rachit Tibrewal,Web Frameworks Library for MRPT,"Robots are slowly becoming a part of the internet of things, and easy control and universal access will be a step in future of robotics. MRPT’s Web Framework Library should address this problem.A lightweight publisher/subscriber mechanism needs to be created for MRPT. The C++ server library and the javascript library will then leverage this to  create further applications. There will be two libraries,  a C++ server library for RPC on the robot. Another will be a javascript library which provides modules for such procedure calls.This task involve serialization of existing mrpt objects for JSON transfer, RPC protocol, websocket setup, 3D rendering of objects in js, reusable js components for sending and receiving data from user created app where the user is largely benefitted from easy to use library methods and objects."
Mobile Robot Programming Toolkit (MRPT),Tushar Kusnur,Project #4 Proposal: Add GTSAM as an external dependency to MRPT,"The problem of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has been around for many years and numerous front-end and back-end methods have been developed to solve it. SLAM is the computational problem of building a consistent map of an agent’s unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of its location at all times within the environment. Currently, MRPT has only one available graph SLAM optimizer class, namely CLevMarqGSO, which uses the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to solve for the nonlinear graph SLAM optimization. We intend to support the usage of other optimization modules found in the GTSAM library (which primarily uses the iSAM2 algorithm) as an optional, external dependency in MRPT."
Mobile Robot Programming Toolkit (MRPT),shubham-kumar1410,Port Existing MRPT algorithms for V-REP simulator,V-REP provides a good platform for combining external libraries that are often used in robotic simulations. The aim of the project is to use this flexibility of the simulator and port existing MRPT algorithms for V-REP simulator so that they can be used in the V-REP simulator. The libraries will be extended to V-REP with the help of V-REP Remote Api which is part of the V-REP API framework
MovingBlocks,Adrian Siekierka,Developing an assortment of sandbox-friendly framework and content modules,"This proposal involves creating a “base game”, or gameplay template, usable by players and expansion mod developers alike. I have spent a long time implementing game design concepts for a more fleshed out sandbox experience, particularly in the areas of building infrastructure and automation (but not focusing strictly on it - this is better left to dedicated games like Factorio), but also the overall progression of gameplay."
MovingBlocks,Devi Acharya @dacharya64,Extending “Light and Shadow” Gameplay and Functionality,"My goal for Google Summer of Code is to work on improvements for the current Light and Shadow module. My hope for the end of the summer is to create a minimal viable product that implements unique assets, gameplay, level design, and mechanics, and can serve as a new mode of gameplay for Terasology."
MovingBlocks,Iaron da Costa Araújo,Event Recording Feature,"At present, Terasology has a very limited amount of types of automated
testing, which includes standard unit tests, environment-based tests and some minor
benchmarking. Recently a new module (ModuleTestingEnvironment) was created to
support integration tests, in which a JUnit tests are used to check more than one
game component together executing in a headless client. Since the creation of this
module was recent, not much was done using it yet. Besides this, another very
requested test feature is the ability to record and replay events of a game session.
With these facts in mind, I propose to create an event saving feature, that record all
Events of a game session, and extend MTE to be able to create integration tests for
the events recorded through this new feature."
MovingBlocks,Naman Tiwari,Renovation of MasterOfOreon,"Renovation of Master of Oreon is an extensive refactor of the current Master of Oreon module. The vision behind MOO is to create a game-play scenario akin to a mixture fortress management of Dwarf Fortress and wizard research in Dungeon Keeper, which will be made available through this project."
MovingBlocks,Neil Moon,Improving the Server Facade,"During Google summer of code 2017, one student worked on making a backend that exposes information about Terasology servers. He also made a frontend using the ReactXP framework, which can build to multiple platforms, such as web, Android, and iOS. However, the backend itself needs some serious work to be considered acceptable for end users. That is what this project is going to try to help accomplish."
MovingBlocks,Sarthak Khandelwal,Multiple Worlds,"Terasology is an open world, open source game but it’s open in the sense that one can explore a single world as much as possible. The idea of this proposal is to add multiple worlds to the game and enable teleportation between two worlds. With Sector’s proof of concept done and ready, this project will serve to be a proof of concept of multiple worlds and efficient entity pool splitting.
The deliverables of this project would be:

1) An improved and more optimized way of queuing chunks for efficient loading and unloading whenever needed.

2) A game with multiple worlds where a player can select multi-world options and can teleport among them using portals."
MovingBlocks,Shreyas Iyer,GooKeeper Implementation,"The aim of this project is to bring SuperSnark’s brilliant game design to life - GooKeeper!  In GooKeeper the player has to setup and maintain a GooZoo, which as the name suggests, is a zoo with different varieties of gooeys. The player has to capture these gooeys from the wild using a special tool, the revolutionary  PlazMaster 3000 into slime-pods and bring them back to the zoo.
These gooeys have different behaviors, some are aggressive, some are passive, and hence capturing them would have different levels of difficulty, and also different payoffs in the zoo.
So, the main aim of the player is to capture exotic varieties of gooeys, keep them fed and happy, and possibly have them mate with one another to give birth to a new, interesting gooey type!"
MovingBlocks,Siarhei Shalyhaila,Game / saved world / module preview image content,"From my perspective, we could remake some game menus and with that improve the user experience.

Mozilla,Fernando García Álvarez,Fretboard: A/B Testing Framework for Android,"This proposal is about developing Fretboard: an A/B testing framework for Android written in Kotlin, taking as foundation the Switchboard fork used in Firefox for Android.

The goal is to make a reusable library decoupled from both the client and server storage mechanism which will allow to make A/B tests on Android apps: check if a user is part of an experiment, schedule frequent updates, get experiment associated metadata, as well as force specific experiments value in order to test the app, for example.

It will also allow security features: certificate pinning and experiment collection signature verification.
The library will be deployed to jcenter and also integrated into Firefox Focus."
Mozilla,Khushil Mistry,Improve Enigmail User Experience,Enigmail is a seamlessly integrated security add-on for Mozilla Thunderbird. The main idea behind this project is to improve Enigmail UI so that non-experts can use encryption easily. This will be done by two main things : 1) UI Improvements 2) Adding UI Testing. Enigmail don’t have UI Test Units. I think that Testing is very important part of any development project. So I am planning to integrate it. Autocrypt setup is also an important part of this project.
Mozilla,Lachlan Sneff,Software-Isolated WASM Processes in Ring 0,Design and partially implement a research operating system that uses WebAssembly to implement software-isolated processes (SIPs) that run in ring 0 in order to allow architecture-agnostic compiled binaries and possibly attain higher performance due to not needing page-table switches and interrupt-based system-calls.
Mozilla,Olle Lauri Boström,WasmFiddle,"The goal of this project is to significantly increase test coverage and test quality in the WebAssembly Studio project. This will make it easier to detect bugs and breaking changes as the project evolves. While doing so, the idea is to simultaneously work on open issues related to the code that is tested during each iteration."
Mozilla,Peter Hrvola,Servo: Prototype ways of splitting up the script crate,The aim of this project is to investigate and propose a plan for *separation of Servo script crate*. Script crate lays in the core of the Servo and requires a large amount of memory to build. Large memory requirements make it impossible to build on 32-bit computers and slowdown development.
Mozilla,Pramit Singhi,Pontoon,"The project mainly focuses on **improving the User Experience** for people who wish to contribute to Pontoon (the localization tool developed by Mozilla) . While there are lots of good features in the Pontoon but there are few problems with the current flow for tool for the first-time users which creates a confusion for the users who wish to contribute.
User Experience (UX) can be improved by making some important changes in the design flow and by implementation of new functionality in the tool like **implementing a tutorial** and making a more smooth design of the tool to help the first-time users. There are **other changes** mentioned as well in my proposal. UX also sometimes involve some changing in the default UI of the tool."
Mozilla,Sagar Bharadwaj K S,Download Spam Protection for Firefox,"The goal of this project is to prevent sites from bombarding the browser with multiple non user initiated downloads.
This would mean that a mechanism to differentiate between user initiated and automatically initiated downloads has to be established as it is undesirable to annoy the user with unnecessary warning and permission prompts even when the user himself has requested for a download.

The project also involves implementing some form of data collection technique (via telemetry) to measure the effectiveness of the implemented logic."
Mozilla,Sagar Gupta,Adding and Improving Functionalities in Autowebcompat,"Basic functionalities which will lead to the completion of the project will be added in this proposal. **Adding desktop browsers** with options of *dimension change, zooming across the webpage* in both desktop and mobile browser, **adding orientation mode** for mobile browser. **Adding a tag to website** for *dynamic or static content*. **Selecting advertisements** in websites which will be trained on a **Faster R-CNN model** to mark them compatible in two screenshots. **Training and testing different models on different types of queries** ie, different types of web compatibilities as selected by user and **maintaining a database with these results including machine information and training time along with the network architecture**. Finally, create a *test.py* wich will **collect screenshots in complete search fashion, chose from the database the best model** for the given type of query and give result of **percentage compatibility**."
Mozilla,Sudhanshu Vishnoi,Implementing cross references and general improvements in ReSpec,"This is a project to implement new features, fix some existing issues and improve maintainability of the [ReSpec](https://github.com/w3c/respec) project. 

Majority of time is expected to be spent in implementing a cross references feature. It includes creating a web service that integrates with ReSpec and expands the existing reference system to allow references across specifications. This task will require some investigation first as to how we can leverage the CSSWG’s [Shepherd API](https://api.csswg.org/shepherd/) and its database. The web service may require creating a custom datastore that allows efficient search for multiple keywords. In the end, it'll provide an easy way to deep-link specifications to each other without much hassle.

Other smaller tasks that I plan to work upon include:
- auto-normalizing references
- implementing automatic linking of pluralized words 

I would also like to work on some of the issues that might come up during the GSoC period."
Mozilla,Tokio Kajitsuka,AOM - accessibility API,"AOM (Accessibility Object Model) is a JavaScript API that allows for modifying an accessibility tree like DOM. In this project, AOM phase 1 & 2 is implemented.
# phase 1
The accessibleNode property is added to DOM Element. The properties of AccessibleNode correspond to ARIA attributes one-to-one, and web browsers can modify accessibility tree via this property. Note that if both an AccessibileNode property and its corresponding ARIA attribute are present, the AccessibleNode property overrides the ARIA attribute.
# phase 2
AccessibleNode interface is derived from EventTarget so that accessibility input events and assistive actions become able to be processed via AccessibleNode. This enables web developers to check whether users are using an assistive technology or not, and this may leads to discrimination against some users. So, web browsers should ask users for permission of listening for accessiblity events before propagating those events to AccessibleNodes."
Mozilla,vishalcr7,Pontoon's path to first contribution,"“Pontoon is Mozilla's localization tool, used by hundreds of contributors to translate Firefox, mozilla.org, and many other Mozilla products. It is critical to shipping Firefox to as many users as possible, all around the world.”

Since active user participation and onboarding is one of the key components for the achievement of Pontoon’s goal towards localization, the idea is to improve the experience of first-time users of Pontoon by defining a ""path to first contribution"" explaining the basic flow and ins and out of contributing towards localising Mozilla applications by adding a guided interactive tour, a walkthrough for explaining basic functionality for  unauthenticated user and a better “Learn More” link replacing the current gitbook link and making all of these as smooth as possible."
Mozilla,wangjie,metricsgraphics - zooming and brushing,MetricsGraphics is a great data visualization library. We hope to add natively support brushing and zooming feature (this part can also be used to create an overview plot) and provide some API to allow highlighting some data points. And we will also make some changes in the hover and click event to make it easier to create a tooltip.
Mozilla,ydidwania,Improved Pulse Inspector Backend,"Over the years, Mozilla has shifted to using Taskcluster as its primary continuous integration system. Communication becomes essential between the various components when scaling the infrastructure. Mozilla uses Pulse to enable an exchange of information Mozilla’s systems. Pulse is actually a RabbitMQ server which uses AMQP ( and follows a Publish--Subscribe pattern). 
Taskcluster-events is a service that allows web clients to listen for pulse messages without RabbitMQ credentials and without the need for a TCP connection to the RabbitMQ server. However, currently, taskcluster-events is old and poorly designed, without protocol specification. This proposal aims to completely rebuild taskcluster-events from scratch, ensuring it is robust and free of major bugs / failures."
MuseScore,Animesh Tewari,Machine Learning Dataset for Optical Music Recognition,"The basic idea would be to support the current scenario of Audiveris OMR integration with MuseScore by accumulating a large correct dataset. The OMR needs to be successfully trained on a large dataset so that it can provide precise outputs which will help the Music community. To carry out this task, a new metadata XML format, similar to the output understandable by Audiveris, is to be implemented in the application so that scores are saved as the desired XML. This project will create a huge dataset of annotated music symbols that will help Audiveris perform better which in turn will bring out a new dimension to Musescore as a feature. This functionality will be able to help support other OMR projects."
MuseScore,Dmitri Ovodok,Score Comparison Tool for MuseScore,"The main goal of the proposed project is creation of a tool integrated into MuseScore which will allow users to compare their scores to see differences between them in textual form. As an additional task, the work on visual comparison tool is planned to be started, though it will not be finished during this summer. For implementation of these tasks some changes will be made to MSCX file format which is one of the formats used by MuseScore for saving music scores. This format will be optimized for suitability for textual comparison purpose which will allow to benefit from well-established robust textual comparison tools for implementation of the score comparison tools mentioned above."
MuseScore,Joshua Bonn,Beginner Mode and Tutorial Creation,"The beginner mode and teaching functionality project will assist newcomers to MuseScore. The beginner mode will present a simpler UI and some simplified options to avoid information overload. It will also integrate the handbook in as on screen help. The teaching functionality will entail many abilities to lock measures, disable UI options, and introduce a “teaching mode” to give tutorials to newcomers."

National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB),Daniyal,GraphSpace: Git for graphs,"GraphSpace is a web-based platform where collaborating research groups can use a user-friendly interface to create, interact and share networks. Users can upload richly-annotated networks using REST APIs irrespective of the algorithms or tools used in the creation of the graph. Cytoscape.js enables the users to interact with the graphs using a graphical user interface. Users can customize the layouts of the graph, search for graphs matching some criteria, organize using tags, save the graph, and share them between collaborating groups or make it available to everyone in Graphspace. 

The goal of this project is to implement a system of version control which will enable users to track changes made to the graphs, save different version of the graph with detailed summary of the changes with respect to previous version. The user will be able to undo changes and backtrack to a previous version of the graph using GUI and REST APIs. A layout created for a particular version of a graph may not be compatible with other versions of the same graph, therefore a feature will be added to check layout compatibility and to transfer layout between different versions of a graph."
National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB),Dara Akdag,Upgrading Ontology Tagging at WikiPathways,"Ontologies are an integral part of our scientific progress. The ability to share common definitions is crucial to answering questions, thus, an updated and persistent ontology is important to invest in. This project will upgrade the current ontology tagging system of WikiPathways by utilising the recommender REST-API of BioPortal. The first part deals with fixing current data fetching mismatches, where tags are stored and fetched inconsistently. The second part of this project is implementing an intuitive tagging function to the process of creating a pathway, allowing the creator to fetch suggestions from BioPortal and add them with a couple of clicks. Lastly, the final part pertains promoting the quality of the tags by crowdsourcing the votes of visiting users."
National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB),Kaan Sancak,PathwayMapper Improvements and Integration into cBioPortal,"While the network visualization module in cBioPortal is a powerful exploration tool, most biologists are more comfortable with the kind of simplified, curated pathway diagrams that are featured in many manuscripts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) . With the motivation of creating a platform that provides more intuitive pathway diagrams, yet supports these with rich data ‘decoration’ and analysis with access to data in cBioPortal, with attractive visualization, a tool named PathwayMapper based on Cytoscape.js was developed. PathwayMapper is a valuable tool for constructing pathways from scratch. One can also use it as a viewer to overlay cancer genomics data on existing ""template"" pathways like those that appeared in TCGA papers. Ultimately, this project has two main purposes. First one is improving PathwayMapper with new attaractive features for both local and colloborative modes. Second one is integrating PathwayMapper into cBioPortal as an alternative to the cBioPortal's current network view."

In particular, the web application will have two main functionalities: it will provide an interactive graph display and it will supply cancer progression models generation by directly calling the TRONCO functions. In addition to that it will provide the users with information about the genes involved in the model."
National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB),Prem Prakash Singh,Integrating CAD and CAM tools for automating a synthetic biology workflow,"In this project, we will use Java as a programming language along with RESTful APIs for the integration of the two tools, one is **SBOLDesigner** and another is  **Build Software Optimisation Tools (BOOST)**. SBOLDesigner is a CAD tool for creating and manipulating the sequences of genetic constructs using the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) 2.0 data model whereas Build-OptimizatiOn Software Tools (BOOST) is a repertoire of CAD/CAM tools for minimizing the cost and time for synthesizing DNA sequences with the maximal success rate of synthesis. Integrating both tools enables automated synthetic biology design-build workflows by providing different functionalities like the reverse translation of proteins into DNA sequence, modification of complex region according to the genetic code, fragmentation of large sequences depending on max. length of synthesis and desired assembly protocol."

National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB),Shalin,Simulating systems biology models in Java,"Computational models of biological systems play an important role in advancing science as they give insights about the biology without the need for performing real experiments. A significant challenge in the systems biology field is the reproducibility and reusability of such models and making these accessible to the broader biology community. To address this issue, computer-readable formats and tools for modeling complex biological systems have been developed. Standards such as Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML) and tools like Systems Biology Simulation Core Library (SBSCL) can represent such complex biological models and numerically simulate them. But until now only a subset of these standards have been implemented in SBSCL. Essential features that will catalyze reproducibility, exchangeability, and reusability are lacking so far. Namely, i) implementation of full support for simulation experiments; ii) plots and visualization of simulation studies; iii) support for standard archive formats; iv) support for Open Source solvers, and v) support for hierarchical models."
National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB),Sunwoo Kang,Rendering Complex Genetic Design with DNAplotlib for a Beautiful Visualization of Genetic Circuit,"Visualizing genetic circuits is essential in the field of synthetic biology. These genetic designs often involve complex representation of modular and hierarchical biosystems. The representations are standardized through the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) in the form of glyphs. To make the visualization of biocircuits more efficient and amenable to automation, my goal is to upgrade DNAplotlib to support highly customizable visualizations of genetic circuits from SBOL version 2 files. 
I will achieve this by integrating DNAplotlib with the pySBOL2 library to support reading and writing of SBOL2 files. The current DNAplotlib only support SBOL 1.0 documentation, and thus is only capable of manifesting DNA components consisted of DNA sequence and sequence annotation. It cannot represent complex interactions between different subcomponents, and thus has poor connectivity with other genetic platforms. Through my work this summer, DNAplotlib will (1) incorporate non-DNA components / partially complete design sequences (2) document and link to external models such as SBML and CellML (3) visualize hierarchical and modular biosystems (4) save customization into SBOL file."

NumFOCUS,Abhishek_Singh,Improve Test Coverage and Test Performance,"This project focuses to improve yt's test framework. At present, yt's Python code coverage is only 25% (unit and answer testing) and the test runtime is approximately 45 minutes. The aim of this project is to increase code coverage and reduce test runtime.

First, I propose the use of [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/), which is a tool to monitor the code coverage and is free for open source repositories. This would not only help in analyzing the key areas that need immediate attention for coverage but will also help in maintaining higher code coverage for future developments.

yt's test suite could be divided into three areas, namely, Python unit tests, Cython test cases and answer testing. I will enhance the yt test suite by writing test cases for the flows that are not being tested currently. Runtime of tests could be improved by optimizing (or reducing) answer testing and image comparisons tests for visualization and volume rendering modules. This project also focuses on streamlining test cases for different geometries and data styles to improve the runtime of tests. Furthermore, the runtime of test suites varies on Linux and OSX, thereby giving us a scope of improvement."

Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) algorithms, also called likelihood free inference techniques, are a family of methods that can render virtually impossible models to feasible scale. Additionally, the ABC approach has proven to be successful over likelihood based methods in several instances and is conceptually linked to recent and very innovative Deep Learning developments such as Generative Adversary Nets.   We propose to implement a module for ABC in PyMC3, specifically Sequential Monte Carlo-ABC (SMC-ABC).  Our work will signify a meaningful increase in the
spectrum of models that PyMC3 will be able to perform."
NumFOCUS,Aneesh Yogesh Joshi,Neural Networks for Similarity Learning,"Reseachers and Industry experts alike turn to gensim for easy-to-pick up and production ready code. Recently, Deep Learning techniques have taken the fore front in apparent ""state of the art"" performances, however, these techniques haven't made their way into production due to unreproducability and lack of availability. This project will evaluate these newer techniques, justify their benefit in reproducible manners and integrate  them into the gensim toolkit."
NumFOCUS,Anthony Wang,Makie.jl – GSoC 2018 Proposal,"`Makie.jl` is a [new plotting library for Julia](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl), providing an interface for `GLVisualize`, with emphasis on interactivity and speed. The [current documentation](https://github.com/SimonDanisch/MakieDocs) is in need of a rewrite, to ensure that it is understandable and illustrative, and example code snippets and outputs need to be added to the documentation where necessary. 

Additionally, there is a database containing example code snippets and example data that can be used to make plots with `Makie`. It is a working point of this project to programmatically integrate these code snippets including the `Makie`-generated output plots into the documentation pages. In addition, tests for the plotting need to be written to verify plotting functionality after coding changes.

Another goal of this project is to create more impressive and creative [plotting examples](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/all-graphs/) for the examples gallery to showcase the power and flexibility of the `Makie.jl` library."
NumFOCUS,Apoorva Pandey,Status Server and Dashboard,"Data retriever provides a number of publicly available datasets. These datasets are not stored at a single
location but are downloaded from various publically available data repositories.
New datasets are being added to retriever regularly so it becomes crucial to check the **availability** and **installation** of all datasets. This is a tedious task so the process needs to
be automated.

The goal of this project is to create a status server and dashboard where maintainers and users
can see the status of datasets i.e. whether the datasets are installing properly or not and the changes that have been made to the dataset."
NumFOCUS,Arijit Kar,Object Tracking,"I propose to add object tracking modules in Julia either as a part of ImageFeatures.jl or as a standalone repository. Therefore, I propose to add the following algorithms:
    1. Optical Flow Algorithms
        1.1. Lucas-Kanade method
        1.2. Farneback Dense Optical Flow method
    2. Tracking Algorithms
        2.1. Boosting Tracking
        2.2. Multiple Instance Learning
        2.3. MedianFlow Tracking
        2.4. Tracking Learning Detection framework

Object tracking is the process of locating a moving object (or multiple objects) over time using a camera. It has a variety of uses, some of which are: human-computer interaction, security and surveillance, video communication and compression, augmented reality, traffic control, medical imaging and video editing."
NumFOCUS,Ashley Kelly,Accessing SPH data and interpolating onto grids,"yt is a package for analyzing and visualizing volumetric data. The current infrastructure of yt is designed to deal with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) data. However, a wide range of modern N-body hydrodynamics simulations now use smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) which produces data consisting of volume filling fields. The current implementation of yt takes this data fills a global octtree, and then treats it similarly to that of AMR data.

The disadvantage of this treatment of SPH data is that it is not intuitive to users, it is slow and it does not represent the underlying nature of the data.

This project aims to develop a yt API for SPH data that ensures all SPH fields return data defined at the locations of the particles. Whilst this would provide a more intuitive way to interact with the data, it is still important to interpolate particle data onto grids, as this is essential in visualisation. This can be achieved by taking inspiration from SPLASH. Thus, at the end of the project SPH fields would be able to be visualised using a ""scatter"" (in technical details) approach, inspired by SPLASH. This would allow the the SPH fields to be interpolated efficiently onto grids."
NumFOCUS,Avik Pal,Model Zoo Examples for Flux.jl,"Currently FluxML/model-zoo has very few examples demonstrating the usage of Flux. In this project I propose to implement several Convolutional Neural Network Models for Computer Vision Problems. Also I intend to contribute to ONNX.jl to speed up its integration with Flux.jl. I shall be implementing around 14 Neural Network Architectures and writing tutorials on their usage. In the process, I will contribute to Flux.jl the layers that are necessary to build those networks so that they can be easily reused."
NumFOCUS,Ayush Shridhar,"Model Import, Export and Computer Vision in Julia","In the upcoming summers, I aim to achieve six objectives in three different fields. These are:

# 1. Model Import :
 I plan on making a reader for machine learning models in Julia. This will help us in loading and running models made using different frameworks into Julia. This involves making a reader for ONNX models, and Keras models. I collaborated with the mentor, Mike Innes to work on this and the code can be found in the ONNX.jl repository under FluxML organization.

# 2. Model Export : 
I will work on demos for the FluxJS.jl model zoo. This will make Machine Learning in Julia more dynamic and flexible, as it would help us in visualizing models in the browser. I'll also work on the main FluxJS package, as it still needs a lot of code tracing.

# 3. Computer Vision :
 I propose to work on two different projects in this direction. The first project involves integrating Metalhead.jl with ONNX.jl . This will help in expanding the functionalities offered by Metalhead.jl. The second part of this project in loading and running Detectron model in Julia. Object detection has never been implemented in Julia before. Loading a Detectron model would help us in detecting objects in Julia."
NumFOCUS,Ayush Suhane,Improve Distance Search Methods in MDAnalysis,"With the capability of multiple MD codes to easily handle milions of atoms, a major roadblock to analysis of this vast amount of data corresponding to positions of each atoms at every timestep is the time to evaluate pairwise distance between multiple atoms. Almost every operation requires the distance between the pair of atoms, fast calculation of pairwise distance is of utmost importance. Multiple basic analysis functions like Radial Distribution Function, Contact Matrices, depepend very heavily on fast distance evaluations. 
Apart from naive approach for pairwise calculations which scale as O(N^2), other forms of data structures like KDTree, Octree are sugested for faster calulations based on the requirements. Based on the MDAnalysis, two use cases are identified as highly used in majority of the analysis algorithms. 
The goal of the project is to identify the data structure based on the requirements of the use case and implement in the MDAnalysis library along with clear documentations and test cases."
NumFOCUS,Benjamin Chu,Iterative Hard thresholding for Genetic Analysis,"Recent advances in molecular biotechnologies demand fast and innovative algorithms to analyze
them effectively. One promising proximal-type algorithm is iterative hard thresholding (IHT). It is
especially well suited to the analysis of modern high-dimensional datasets common in genomics,
and was recently implemented in Julia as IHT.jl for both numeric and genomic data. Compared to
related packages, the current IHT implementation excels in aspects such as memory management
and model selection, but lacks important analysis features such as group selection relevant to
genomic analysis. Hence, IHT.jl is ripe for improvement."
NumFOCUS,Bill Engels,Extending Gaussian Process Functionality in PyMC3,"This main focus of this project will be to extend the functionality of the
PyMC3 Gaussian process module.  I plan to focus my contribution on extending
functionality for handling larger data sets.  A secondary goal is to understand
more about the maintenance and release cycle of PyMC3, with the intention of
assisting in this work going forward.  In a similar vein, I am also interested
in helping port existing PyMC3 code to PyMC4 if a backend decision is made
before the close of GSoC.

The PyMC3 GP module is broken into multiple implementations The Gaussian
process module currently contains one larger-data (referred to as ""sparse"")
approximation method that applies to data observed with normally distributed
noise.  An additional implementation exploits Kronecker structure in the 
covariance matrix to obtain efficiency gains, but also only applies to
data observed with normally distributed noise."
NumFOCUS,Davide Cruz,Implementing on-the-fly coordinate transformations,"Implement trajectory transformations on the MDAnalysis API, to be called on-the-fly by the user, eliminating the requirement for multiple intermediate steps of modifying and saving the trajectory, and giving users a more efficient and simple workflow for simulation data analysis."
NumFOCUS,Dmitriy Persiyanov,Multi-stream API,"Gensim is an NLP library which claims to be highly effective during training and produce linear performance growth with increasing the number of threads.

Currently, that is not true on machines with a large number of cores (>10) and large data files. The reason of this is that almost all Gensim models which support multithreaded training work in the following way. There is **single job producer** -- worker which reads the data and pushes the chunks into the job queue. Also, there are **many job consumers** -- workers which pull the chunks and update the model parameters in parallel.

The problem is that consumers'  code is optimized well, so this leads to **workers starvation** problem. Job producer just can't fill the queue at such a high pace. This is the case even using fastest `read the line, split it and yield` corpus iterator.

This problem could be solved by allowing users to pass `K` data streams (currently only single-stream == single job producer thread is supported), e.g. which point to `K` large files and use `K` job producers to fill the job queue."
NumFOCUS,Eeshan Gupta,Guaranteed Root Finding and Global Optimization with Intervals,"Interval arithmetic provides a way to perform computations with continuous sets of real numbers or vectors, for example to bound the range of a function over a given set.

This can be used to find roots (zeros) of functions in a guaranteed way, by excluding regions where there are no roots and zooming in on roots, but always within a given interval.

It can also be used to do global optimization of functions in a deterministic way, that is, find the global minimum of a non-convex, nonlinear function. Interval methods for global optimization provide a guaranteed bound for the global optimum, and sets that contain the optimizers.

This project proposes to significantly improve these methods using techniques found in the interval arithmetic literature."
NumFOCUS,Elfarouk Harb,Refactor NN Module + Essential RL Module + Cool Cookbooks!,"My proposed project is made of three parts.

The first is to (re)write some code in the neural network module to make it more generic and lightly coupled. This will incorporate using stan::math library.

The second is to introduce an essential Reinforcement learning module to Shogun.

The third is to showcase the neural network and RL modules of Shogun using a lot of new exciting cookbooks and
notebooks to show all the newly written features."
NumFOCUS,Fabian Löschner,[fenics] Maximizing performance on modern architectures with data-level parallelism,"In the solution process of problems discretized using FEM, the assembly of element level tensors to the global matrix often contributes a significant amount of computational time relative to the overall process. The goal of this GSoC 2018 project is to improve the performance of the FEniCS framework in the assembly phase. To achieve this, the FEniCS Form Compiler (FFC) should be enhanced such that the generated code can fully utilize data-level parallelism (SIMD) functionality of modern CPUs."
NumFOCUS,Gaetano Priori,Thread-Safety in the Julia Compiler,"Abstract. Even tough Julia is a general purpose language, it
has always been developed with scientific computing in mind, a
field where the amount of data and the complexity of algorithms
demand both the possibility to distribute computations and high
confidence on the results.
This is way thread safety is one of the goals for the 1.0 release,
as multi-thread development brings new security challenges, which
are known for being particularly difficult to tackle.
In this proposal I will designate a road-map to progress the
work already done, both by solving current issues and by updating
compiler’s components which are not thread safe.
At the end, a more efficient way to debug common errors arising
from Julia’s multi-thread programming will be discussed."
NumFOCUS,Igor Baratta,Complex Number support in FEniCS,"In many fields of science and engineering (such as electrodynamics, acoustics, and quantum mechanics), the partial differential equations (PDEs) can be complex-valued. Currently, the finite element solver of the FEniCS Project, DOLFIN, supports only real floating-point arithmetic limiting the scope of application on these fields. The primary goal of this project is to extend the capabilities of DOLFIN to support complex numbers, and thus to directly represent complex-valued fields, opening up the possibility of the solution of large-scale complex-valued PDEs using FEniCS."
NumFOCUS,Jiawei Li,Improvements for JuliaNLSolvers,"My plan mainly consists of three parts: documentation, benchmarks and improving functionality.

`LsqFit.jl`, and `NLsolve.jl` only have example codes in their READMEs. Documentation for these projects will be good references for users. Beginner’s guide would dramatically reduce the learning curve for new users. Examples are also needed for `Optim.jl`, `LsqFit.jl` and `NLsolve.jl` to show people the Julia “pipeline” in areas such as Machine Learning, Statistics and Economics. Meanwhile, codes in documentation and examples can be used for testing.

Benchmarks are essential to show the advantage of Julia and therefore may persuade outside users to switch. By comparing with `SciPy`, it will also help guide development and find bugs.

`LsqFit.jl` is still on an early development stage and has large potential to improve. For example, allowing non-vectorized functions for `LsqFit.jl` will help it apply to more problems."
NumFOCUS,Justin Calamari,Conda-Forge Bot for Automatic Updates of Recipes,"Conda-forge is a collection of recipes, build infrastructure, and distributions for the conda package manager that makes it easy for developers to make source packages installable via conda. Conda-forge keeps the conda recipes for its packages in separate GitHub repositories called feedstocks. Traditionally, when a package has been updated, it has been the job of the package maintainers to update the recipe in the feedstock with the proper metadata for the most recent version. Not all package maintainers remember to update the feedstock when releasing new versions, however, causing some packages on conda-forge to be out of date. Recently, the conda-forge autotick bot was developed to automatically track out of date feedstocks and open pull requests to bump them to the newest version of the source code. The bot is a work in progress and still in its early stages. This summer I will implement a series of fixes and enhancements to the bot."
NumFOCUS,Lauri Nyman,Implementing Eigenvalue Problem Solvers for Sparse Matrices in Julia,"The aim of this project is to implement eigenvalue problem solvers for sparse matrices in Julia in order to reduce the dependency of Julia language on ARPACK. During the GSoC program, my goal is to create a drop-in replacement for the current ’eigs’ function in pure Julia. The focus will be on nonsymmetric matrices, but if there is time, the implementation could be extended to cover symmetric matrices as well. As a part of this project, I will provide benchmarks comparing the performance of the new implementation of ’eigs’ versus the ARPACK’s implementation of ’eigs’ that is currently in use. The aim is to get this new method into the package IterativeSolvers.jl."
NumFOCUS,Matthew C. Kelley,Speech recognition for the Flux model zoo,"Details of deep learning models and their performance are, unfortunately, often published without accompanying implementation code. Those models that come from speech recognition seem to be particularly susceptible to this phenomenon. The present project proposes to create a working implementation of a speech recognition model using the Flux library for the Julia programming language and contribute its code to the Flux model zoo. The model to be implemented is Zhang et al.'s (2017) model from their paper ""Towards end-to-end speech recognition with deep convolutional neural networks."" Due to being implemented using only convolutional layers, this model will be lighter to train than previous models that have used heavier recurrent layers, while still achieving state-of-the-art performance. Having a working implementation of this network will be a step forward in opening the culture of automatic speech recognition. As a result, newcomers to the field will have a recent example to look at for inspiration, which is paramount because there are not many novice-friendly resources available for doing speech recognition research."
NumFOCUS,Mikhail Vaganov,Tools for the N-body Simulations in Julia,"A large number of interacting bodies is the key component in explanation of many physical phenomena. From the gravitational interaction of stars and planets to molecular dynamics and electron gas in quantum mechanics, the N-body problem formalism plays an essential role in modeling those systems. The goal of this project is to create tools for conducting N-body simulations in a fast, accurate and reliable manner. Often the interaction of bodies can be described by means of differential equations (DEqs) so that the task of finding the state of the system at a particular time leads to solving those equations. The packages of JuliaDIffEq organization were developed exactly to supply efficient Julia implementations of solvers for various DEqs. The current project describes an extension of DiffEqPhysics.jl package, which will allow researchers to solve the N-body problems in different physical models and applications."

The package will be interfaced in IterativeSolvers.jl. Additionally, parallel algebraic multigrid preconditioners will be implemented extending AMG.jl. Common preconditioners will then be grouped into a package and further interfaced in IterativeSolvers.jl. Testing wil be done using buckling problems defined with the help of JuAFEM.jl. The methods developed in this project will be benchmarked against Base.eigs and JacobiDavidson.jl, and results will be published on Github. Finally, the packages developed will be documented and ported to Julia 1.0 when it is released."

Since Flux is a new library, it is essential to have lots of examples demonstrating its use. This would make it easy for new users to pick it up. Along with the great features of flux, its website should showcase good demos. It is important that the demos be appealing to clients. Hence, the projects listed include applying AI on visual art and games through Flux models."
NumFOCUS,Pietro Vertechi,A modern tool for data exploration based on JuliaDB and WebIO,"We will combine the JuliaDB.jl package, for tabular data manipulations in Julia, with WebIO.jl and InteractNext.jl to build a user-friendly web-based app for data analysis and visualizations.

We will draw from PlugAndPlot.jl, a previous attempt based on QML and focused on the analysis of population data. The advantages of the new JuliaDB/WebIO based approach are:

- we can exploit JuliaDB's unique features, such as parallel storage and computing, support for online statistical techniques and machine learning techniques
- WebIO allows deploying in a wide variety of frameworks: the Julia IDE Juno's plot pane, Jupyter notebook, an Electron window or a web page via Mux.jl

The web page deployment is particularly relevant in our view as it allows to make interactive data visualizations easily accessible online.

Finally, rather than building a monolithic app, we will modularize our design to the extent possible, thus allowing different projects to reuse parts of it to create GUIs with different designs or based on different algorithms and visualization packages."

Base contains some tools to inspect code for performance problems, but those are not very beginner friendly and hard to integrate into an IDE.
Displaying performance lint warnings directly in the source code will make it much easier to spot and correct performance problems for new and seasoned programmers alike. In some cases it might even be possible to offer automated fixes for common performance issues (e.g. changing the type of a local variable or using non-const globals)."

NumFOCUS,Vaibhav Dixit,Parameter estimation for nonlinear dynamical models.,"A differential equation model of a dynamical system is a nonlinear parameterized model that is created to match realistic scenarios and occasionally it might be associated with some data, obtained from the system or through simulation. Once there is reasonable level of confidence in the correctness of the model, the task that remains is to estimate the parameters of the model. Due to the structure of parameter estimation problems in dynamical models, statistics and machine learning techniques are an ideal choice for determining the parameters. During the course of the summer I will be implementing some statistical algorithms, including Stochastic Approximation Expectation Maximization(SAEM) and Maximum A Posteriori Estimation (MAP), for parameter estimation of a dynamic model. I will also work on extending support for parameter estimation in Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) by adding first differences distribution to generalized Log-Likelihood. These would be quite important additions to the suite of methods in JuliaDiffEq and would be of great use to scientific community involved in systems biology, HIV-AIDS study, and drug dosage estimation."

However, open source implementation of the algorithms is lacking at the moment. This project aims to add state-of-the-art exponential Runge-Kutta integrators to JuliaDiffEq's solver repertoire, which can benefit both algorithm developers and researchers who need efficient solvers for stiff problems.

Stiffness detection and automatic switching algorithms will not only help users choose a near optimal solver for the problem, but it will also greatly improve the efficiency of solving ODEs by switching algorithms within the time domain of interest. Stiffness detection and automatic switching algorithms are not presently implemented for most ODE solvers except `LSODA`. Also, there is no open source index reduction algorithm for DAEs.

OSGeo,Aasheesh Tiwari,Making pgRoutingLayer plugin compatible with QGIS 3.0 and Adding GUI support for proposed stable functions which are scheduled for next release.,"The new version of QGIS has introduced an API break. The key changes in QGIS 3.0 are as follows:

Updated from Qt4 to Qt5 

Updated from PyQt4 to PyQt5
 
Updated from Python 2.7 to Python 3.0

QGIS API is improved , many classes have been deprecated or renamed.

The above changes have implications that the pgRoutingLayer plugin is no longer compatible with QGIS 3.0 . For my GSoC project, I propose to accommodate these changes in pgRoutingLayer plugin code and also make use of the new features introduced in QGIS 3.0 to improve the functionality of plugin’s GUI. Also currently there is no test coverage for plugin code which makes it difficult to change features efficiently, so a complete unit test coverage will be built which not only will help in this project but also in future ventures. In addition to this I propose to add functionality for the proposed stable functions of following families:

Astar : pgr_astarCost , pgr_astarCostMatrix

Bidirectional astar : pgr_bdAstarCost , pgr_bdAstarCostMatrix

Bidirectional Dijkstra : pgr_bdDijkstraCost , pgr_bdDijkstraCostMatrix

A Minimum Spanning Tree in an undirected connected weighted graph is a spanning tree of minimum weight. For this I will implement two Functions that are Prim Algorithms and Kruskal Algorithms.

Finding the minimum cut of an edge weighted graph is a fundamental algorithmic problem. Stoer–Wagner algorithm is a recursive algorithm to solve the minimum cut problem in undirected weighted graphs with non-negative weights. The essential idea of this algorithm is to shrink the graph by merging the most intensive vertices, until the graph only contains two combined vertex sets.

OSGeo,Radek Novotný,Improve GRASS GIS integration in QGIS 3,"Currently, GRASS integration in QGIS is hard to maintain. There are two QGIS plugins - Processing and GRASS Plugin, which differs each other. This proposal is focused on Processing plugin. Processing plugin is at this moment maintained by QGIS developers in core Git repository. This situation has been discussed in the QGIS and GRASS GIS mailing lists several times. GUI dialogues of the Processing plugin are generated from manually maintained text UI description files. 

My goal is to design a Python library which allows creating this text UI files automatically from generated GRASS XML description. This library also has to simplify and divide parameters for QGIS. This approach would be similar to the function of SAGA (or OTB) Processing plugin integration QGIS."

OSGeo,Sourabh Garg,Implement Parallel Dijkstra’s and Bellman-Ford algorithm by the Parallel BGL,"Graph Algorithms like Dijkstra’s single source shortest path algorithm are widely applied in many routing applications, but for the Large-scale graph, computation problem may arise. It may be beneficial to exploit the high-performance parallel computing system, by implementing distributed graph algorithms in pgRouting.The current state of the pgRouting doesn’t support any parallel algorithm. I am proposing to add Parallel Dijkstra’s Algorithm using Parallel BGL functionalities and additionally a classical sequential graph algorithm namely, bellman_ford_shortest_paths to pgRouting during this GSoC period."
OSGeo,Xuri Gong,Implement Geospatial Data Viewer in pgAdmin4 for PostGIS,"pgAdmin is the GUI management tool for PostgreSQL. The latest version pgAdmin4 is web-based and written in Python and jQuery with Bootstrap, using the Flask framework. But currently there is no geospatial data viewer in pgAdmin4, and external applications, such as QGIS are required if we want to  browser the data in a map. It’s not convenient for users to view geometries directly in pgAdmin4 “Data Output” table panel.

I propose to implement a geospatial data viewer in pgAdmin4 that will allow users to view the tables in a spatial database and the results of queries executed. With the viewer I intend to develop, users can directly view geospatial data on a map within the pgAdmin4 GUI. Refer to the [project wiki](https://trac.osgeo.org/postgis/wiki/GoogleSummerCode2018) to get more detail."
OSGeo,roberta_fagandini,GRASS GIS module for Sentinel-2 cloud and shadow detection,"Optical sensors are unable to penetrate clouds leading to related incorrect reflectance values. Unlike
Landsat images, Sentinel 2 datasets do not include thermal and Quality Assessment bands that simplify
the detection of clouds avoiding erroneous classification. At the same time, clouds shadows on the ground lead to anomalous reflectance values which have to be taken into account during the image processing.
The project aim is the coding of a specific module for GRASS GIS application which implements the procedure developed within my PhD research. The procedure allows to automatically identify clouds and their shadows in Sentinel 2 images applying some rules on reflectance values (values thresholds, comparisons between bands, etc.). These have been defined starting from rules found in literature and conveniently refined. Then the detection of shadows is improved using an adapted shape index. In order to increase the accuracy of the final results, a control check is implemented. Clouds and shadows are spatially intersected in order to remove misclassified areas. The final outputs are two different vector files (OGR standard formats), one for clouds and one for shadows."
OWASP Foundation,Aashish Singh,OWASP Juice Shop : Frontend Technology Update,"Juice shop uses AngularJS for it's frontend along with Bootstrap. Keeping the application up to date with the latest technologies is important to keep the modern look and feel it is about.
 The objective of the project is to replace Juice Shop's current frontend written in AngularJS with Angular and also bring in Angular Material in place of Bootstrap.

OWASP Foundation,Emmanouil Kirtas,WebSockets Active Scanning,"For my contribution to the ZAP I am going to implement an active web socket scan. Specifically, I will develop an extension for WebSocket add-on by adding some Active Scans. The Active scan will include tests to web application in SQL Injections vulnerabilities.To accomplish my idea I will test web application using Time Based techniques.
Another significant vulnerability is that the WebSocket protocol doesn’t handle authentication. Practically this means that, a WebSocket opened from a page behind authentication  doesn’t “automatically” receive any sort of authentication. That makes possible to establish a connection without authentication making use of http and origin headers field of the client. Some other posible attacks and scans at WebSockets are the classic bruteforce attack, Local and Remote file inclusion, the Stored and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting. I am going to implement some of the above scans, (as more as possible) starting with SQls Injections. I strongly believe that we could easily add the scans if the basic infrastructure was build. Aditional, the extensions will come with appropriate user interface and API."
OWASP Foundation,Hannah Brand,Increasing Robustness of Vuln Modules,"One issue outstanding in OWASP Nettacker is the addition of more data to vulnerability modules.

OWASP Foundation,M. Kajan,Automated authentication detection and configuration,"The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is one of the world’s most popular and best maintained free security tool. It has extensive support for both automated and manual pen-testing of web applications. One such support is automatic reauthentication when the application terminates the session being used for testing, either defensively or for other reasons so that subsequent requests are ineffective until the session is restored. With the current implementation, a user must manually configure ZAP to handle authentication. This is time-consuming and error-prone. This project targets to allow ZAP to help detect login and registration pages and provide more assistance when configuring authentication, ideally being able to completely automate the task for as many sorts of web apps as possible.

Expected Results:
• Automatic detection of login and registration pages.
• A wizard to walk users through the process of setting up authentication, with as much assistance as possible.
• An option to completely automate the authentication process, for as many authentication mechanisms as possible."

OWASP Foundation,Priyanka Jain,OWASP SKF - New user experience based on chat bots,"Security Knowledge Framework (SKF) is a tool that is used as a guide for building and verifying secure software.It can also be used to train developers about application security. The OWASP Security Knowledge Framework is an expert system web-application that uses the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard and other resources. It can be used to support developers in pre-development (security by design) as well as after code is released (OWASP ASVS Level 1-3). 
Chatbots are software agents that interact with the user in a conversation. A chatbot is a service which is provided by websites so that users can easily able to fetch information interactively. They can reach out to a large audience on messaging apps and be more effective. A chatbot provides a speedy and quick response and available around the clock. Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner. Chatbot will be an attempt to reduce the pain of the user and will help users in finding solutions to their problems and thus improving the security of code and infrastructure. This will be integrated into various chat systems to make it easier to use."
OWASP Foundation,S Rahul Badami-1,Bug Logging Tool,"BLT lets anyone report issues they find on the internet. It gives points to users for reporting bugs .But it lacks mobile portability that is the app is not so mobile friendly. Also, it lacks in rewarding users who report bugs.

Open Bioinformatics Foundation,Sarthak Sehgal,Frontend Website Student Project for BioJS,"BioJS is a library of over two hundred JavaScript components which enables users to visualise and process data. BioJS currently has two websites:
1. Biojs.io: it lists all the components (npm packages) of BioJS with detailed information and visualisation(s).
2. Biojs.net: it is an informational website for the BioJS organisation.

BioJS.io gets the data of all the components through a middleware called workman. The development of a new workman has already been initiated which needs to be completed for integration with the frontend. I propose to create a new frontend website for BioJS and to integrate it with the backend/middleware to get the data in the most optimized way. The website will be developed using VueJS which makes it easy to maintain and the website will merge the currently existing websites and produce a consistent and modern UI and a better UX."

A common task in proteomics is to identify and quantify proteins in complex biological mixtures. In a standard tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) protocol, a crucial part is to control the uncertainty in peptide identifications generated by search engines that match MS spectra to peptides. Based on an idea suggested by the OpenMS team, I propose a project to improve the posterior error probability estimation for peptide search engine results in OpenMS."
Open Bioinformatics Foundation,synchon,Adding methods to cobrapy for improved constraint-based metabolic modelling.,"Constraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) methods for Genome-wide Metabolic Networks (GEMs) have proven to be essential for the varied applications of metabolic modelling, from predicting growth rate of an organism to production of antibiotics and lethality analysis to name a few.  FBA or, Flux Balance Analysis is the earliest COBRA method and the most widely used. But, currently, we have sub-divisions of metabolic modelling strategies which are uncovering the flaws of FBA. To fix these flaws, we have been developing multiple methods which are also being backed by experimental data. So, now we are integrating data from experiments in the models and developing methods for a much better understanding of the metabolic pathways and functionalities of the organisms. The data-driven approaches provide more information about the models and hence provide us with a deeper understanding of the networks."
Open Chemistry,Adarsh Balasubramanian,Avogadro 2: Molecular Dynamics,"This project aims to implement support for **Molecular Dynamics** in Avogadro. 

Molecular dynamics (MD) is a computer simulation method for studying the physical movements of atoms and molecules. The atoms and molecules are allowed to interact for a fixed period of time, giving a view of the dynamic evolution of the system. In the most common version, the trajectories of atoms and molecules are determined by numerically solving Newton's equations of motion for a system of interacting particles. In this project, we aim to provide support in Avogadro for reading MD trajectory files and analyzing the various aspects of the MD calculation like temporal evolution, particle movement characterization (eg. pair distribution functions) etc. Also, input generation and support for running MD calculations in common packages like OpenMM and GROMACS shall be focused upon in the later stages of the project."
Open Chemistry,Boran Adas,Create a generalized fingerprinting function,Chemical fingerprints are very important for both querying chemical data (using similarity in fingerprint space) and the use of molecular entities in machine learning. The RDKit already supports a broad variety of fingerprinting functionality but is limited by the fact that the current fingerprint implementations are all independent and have slightly different APIs. This makes things unnecessarily complicated for users and requires people who are interested in exploring new types of fingerprints to write far more code than it seems like they should have to. In this project we will create a generic decoupled fingerprinting module with a consistent and flexible API.

Open Chemistry,Naruki Yoshikawa,"GSoC 2018 Proposal: Fast, Efficient Fragment-Based Coordinate Generation","Chemical information is provided in various formats. Open Babel is a tool to convert file formats. When we translate a format which does not include 3-D coordinate information into a format which requires it, we must predict coordinates. Open Babel implements a rule-based coordinate prediction method, but the current implementation is problematic. It sometime fails when we treat inorganic and organometallic molecules, and by relying on force field geometry optimization, it is slower than distance-geometry or fragment-based methods.

This is a proposal to implement a fast and efficient method to calculate 3-D coordinates using fragment information. Since fragments can decide the position of many atoms at once and minimize the need for conformer sampling, this approach is more efficient. [P. Baldi's paper in 2013](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ci4005282) reports that their fragment-based method is more accurate and 10 times faster than Open Babel. Implementing a better prediction method is beneficial for chemistry and leads to new discoveries in the field of drug design."

Open Data Kit,Lakshya Gupta,Supervisor app - Device to Device Transfer Android Application,The common requirement of Collect users is to share forms between devices. This is important for forms that need to be filled out in multiple steps by different enumerators. And sometimes form need some review before actually getting submitted to the server. A supervisor will be able to review the forms and upload the good ones and send back the bad ones for improvement. So this project will allow enumerators to share partially/completely filled forms with each other and also help supervisor in reviewing the forms. The main focus of this project is to see the pros/cons of different communication strategies possible in Android devices and select the one which is both robust and reliable.
Open Food Facts,Huzaifa Iftikhar,Add Continuous Scan and Thorough Product Addition using OCR in Native Android Application,"This project aims to introduce a continuous scan feature in the Open Food Facts native android application.

Since dealing with different kinds of plasmas is an important part of plasma physics, having a more compact way of working with these kinds of plasmas will be a milestone of substantial importance and priority for PlasmaPy."
OpenAstronomy,Rocio Kiman,Develop Astropy Tutorials on how to fit data.,"Making tutorials is as important as writing code. Without the tutorials, many useful tools would be left out simply because the user does not understand how to use them. The goal of this project is to make tutorials about the tools available in Astropy to fit 1D data complementing with EMCEE and/or the Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithm. This tutorials will compare different fitting problems a user could run into: how to make a quick fit, how to build a custom model and how to fit data when the user does not trust the errors of the data.

OpenAstronomy,Swapnil Sharma,Phase-resolved oscillations,"Quasi-periodic oscillations are the “heart-beat” of black holes and neutron stars: oscillations with changing phase and frequency, probably due to the complicated motion of matter around these objects. Besides characterizing how these frequencies evolve in time (accelerate, decelerate, for example, when the luminosity increases), it is important to understand their exact physical meaning. A few examples in the literature use different approaches to the problem, and calculate the different spectrum of the light emitted at different phases of these oscillations. This is highly non-trivial: one cannot follow easily the single “heartbeat”, but needs to apply a strong de-noising to the signal first, and then calculate the average spectrum during the oscillation."
OpenAstronomy,Vishnunarayan K I,Transition to astropy time,"SunPy uses python `datetime` module for handling almost all time related things. `datetime` is not the best choice for astronomy related projects due to a lot of reasons (for instance, it does not handle leap seconds). The answer is to use `time` module from `astropy`. 

`astropy.time.Time` can do a lot things including:
- Handle leap seconds
- Easy conversion between format like `iso`, `isot` etc.
- Easy conversion between scales like `utc`, `tai` etc.
- Can be initialized from and converted to a lot of popular time formats and even supports python `datetime`.
- Ability to create custom classes to support extra formats of time.

This makes `astropy.time` the best candidate to replace python `datetime` in SunPy.

This project will transition the whole of SunPy to use `astropy.time` instead of python `datetime`."

OpenCensus,ADAM GARZA,OpenCensus.io conversion: using Markdown in a HUGO platform (SSG),"Think back to the first website you built. Most developers start by creating a series of pages contained within individual HTML files. Each will call in assets such as images, CSS and perhaps a sprinkling of JavaScript. You possibly launched these files directly from the file system without a web server. Life was simple.

	Difficulties arise as your site becomes larger and more complex. Consider navigation: it may be similar in every file, but adding a new page requires updates to every other. Even references to CSS and images can become awkward as folder structures evolve.
Consider collaborations: coordinating continuous integration from multiple sources or departments, needing the liberty to independently modify their portion of a site.

	I propose the use of HUGO – a Static Site Generator. [4] An SSG is a compromise between using a hand-coded static site and a full CMS, while retaining the benefits of both. In essence, you generate a static HTML-only website using CMS-like concepts such as templates. The content can them be extracted from Markdown files."

OpenMRS working to build the world's largest and most flexible technology platform to support delivery of health care in some of the most challenging environment on the planet."" This project address set of environments challenges of OpenMRS and makes those more flexible. This project gives flexibility for the OpenMRS product to achieve environment limitations such as internet connections.
Merge Patient data from multiple Installation projects is developing an OpenMRS module as an OpenMRS database synchronizing tool. This module brings the patient records together and merges into the central database.
In the project merge patients, encounters, and observations from multiple instances into a new instance and the merged data would be read-only used reporting and analysis purposes. Furthermore, when merging data into the central database module provide an option to anonymise the merge data. and It uses two different encryption method for secure data transfers between multiple instances https or ssh key-based authentication."
OpenMRS,Piyush Kundnani,RESTful Submission of Forms in HTML Form Entry,"This project mainly involves REST-ifying the current APIs that the HTML Form Entry module offers. These REST endpoints will enable users to replicate all the form submission and other form related actions without the need for legacy html form submission.
The Primary Objective of this project is to:
Extend the HTML Form Entry Module to allow submission of HTML forms via RESTful APIs therby Restifying all the current API endpoints.
Develop a proof of concept OWA allowing basic data entry to submit HTML forms through the API so that the API can be thoroughly tested."
OpenMRS,Prabodh Kotasthane,OAuth Module Enhancements and SMART Apps Support,"Enhance the OAuth2 module by migrating to annotation-based configuration, integrating the EHR launch flow for SMART applications, add support for scopes and launch context and finally increasing the code coverage."
OpenMRS,Ridmal Liyanagamge,Enhancement of Attachment module,OpenMRS is an open source software platform which provides facilities to design of a customized medical system with no programming knowledge. So it consists of many modules which developed to execute many different functionalities. Attachment module enables the view and manages file attachments functionalities in the openMRS. So this proposal for enhancement of attachment module to v2.o release with 100% restful and open web app.
OpenMRS,Samuel Male,Merge Patient data from Multiple Installations Skip to end of metadata,"This project is all about adding a new feature of merging Patient and related meta data from different OpenMRS instances to one master database. 
Details: https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/projects/Merge+Patient+data+from+Multiple+Installations"
OpenMRS,Suthagar Kailayapathy,Location Based Access Control,"OpenMRS already has the privilege based access control implementations. Like that one, we need to implement a Location based Access control system for OpenMRS. It will manage the access to the services based on the locations.
Some implementations want to register the users and patients (the persons also) in certain selected locations. Then access them based on the location that someone has logged in. That way, if someone is logged in a certain location, they should see only those encounters, observations, and patients registered in that location."
OpenStreetMap,Anusha Singh,OSM Public Transport Editor-2nd Part,I plan to enhance the public transport web editor developed by David Kocich in GSoC’17. The proposed project will enhance the existing PT web editor by adding more editing functionality and modifying existing features. The aim is to provide a simple and intuitive application to make the editing of PT in OSM easier.
OpenStreetMap,Biswesh Mohapatra,Continued development of Public Transport Assistant,"The project proposes to make the Public Transport Assistant more reliable, work properly with all forms of transport and help assist a mapper in a better way than what it does in its current form."
OpenStreetMap,Heorhi Sidoryn,Golang implementation of Openstreetmap API,"At the moment, it's really hard to start contributing to Rails Port and Cgimap because of realization complexity.  

Concerning Rails Port, the website directly accesses the same bits of data as the API, via Rails, from the database. This means the website and API are tightly coupled and it's impossible to change one without changing the other.  

Cgimap currently supports only a few of the available API calls and all of them are read-onl. To support writing new data to the API, this is going to require some major changes to how cgimap works internally.  

Therefore it is necessary to make OSM editing API faster and performance more transparent."
OpenStreetMap,Princi Vershwal,iD Editor : Support for vector tile data,"iD currently uses publicly available reference data when editing OpenStreetMap. This data is often in the form of raster tiles (aerial imagery published as bitmap, gif, jpeg).
This project aims to provide support for vector tiled data. Vector tiles are a popular open standard to deliver map geometry and metadata, in form of pre-defined roughly-square shaped ""tiles"", to a browser or other client application."
OpenStreetMap,Srikant Chepuri,GTFS Converter,Using GTFS integration tool a mapper can compare public transport data from OSM and GTFS feed of a particular area and make changes to the OSM public transport data using JOSM Editor.
OpenStreetMap,Thomas Hervey,Adding Notes to iD Editor,"Notes help users and editors understand what needs to be fixed. Adding notes to the iD editor allows editors to see descriptions of issues for an area that they are working on, comment on them, and close them."
OpenStreetMap,floscher,"Extend wikipedia plugin for JOSM, especially with regard to wikidata","Adds extended validation for wikidata/wikipedia tags, all integrated with the standard JOSM validator.
The plugin will show the main information that is available on Wikidata, including weblinks, images and important wikidata properties (postal code, population, …). The wikidata items will also be browsable on the map inside JOSM.
When discrepancies between OSM and Wikidata are found, there will be options to correct either source (after verifying which is the correct one)."
OpenWISP,Anurag Sharma,OpenWISP IPAM: IP Address Management tool for OpenWISP 2,This project idea consists in creating a new OpenWISP 2 IPAM module with the basic features for IP Address Management.
OpenWISP,Rohith A. S. R. K.,OpenWISP 2 Radius,"One of the features missing in the OpenWISP modules is AAA (Authorization, Authentication, and Accounting). RADIUS is a networking protocol that provides centralized AAA management for users who connect and use a network service.
FreeRADIUS is a very widely used RADIUS suite. OpenWISP 2 Radius would be a new addition to modules of OpenWISP providing a multi-tenant web interface to manage the FreeRADIUS databases. Apart from the basic AAA, it would have many necessary features like enforcing session/ bandwidth limits, enhanced security of the API and adding users in batches."
OpnTec,Nikit,Enhancement of FOSSASIA OpenEvent Android App,"This proposal is mainly about adding new features to the Open Event Android App.

Goals

Create a section for videos of the talk so that after the event ends people who were not able to make it to the event can see them

Create a Geofence around the location of event so that the attendees will receive a notification as soon as they are near the venue

UI/UX improvements

Converting the Codebase to Kotlin

Implementing all the new APIs of the open event server in the app

Adding an Intro screen to the app"
OpnTec,Rainb,OpenEvent bug solving,How do we accelerate openevent development?
Oppia Foundation,Aashish Gaba,Improve the image loading pipeline,The project aims at extending the audio asset caching and preloading functionality in the frontend to handle images as well. Also the aim is to migrate the current image data from App Engine Datastore to Google Cloud Storage and to store the new images in the Google Cloud Storage.
Oppia Foundation,Akshay Anand,Add Functionality for Skills,"This proposal aims to add a new Skills construct at a global level that would replace the existing refresher explorations method that is employed for specific answer groups in questions. Along with this, pretests can also be added to explorations testing particular skills. For this, a skill editor is created for skill creation. The questions for the skills will be from the common Questions construct in the back end.
In the future, collections are to be removed and replaced by topics and stories, and hence this project lays the foundation for that also by creating a topic and story editor (and the backend constructs for the same) as well as integrating skills with those."
Oppia Foundation,Apurv Bajaj,Improving the development workflow,"The project, improving the development workflow, emphasizes on the following aspects:
1. Reducing the reviewer time by automating lint checks and tests for Oppia developers and code reviewers.
2. Catching errors with the help of non-flaky and thorough end-to-end tests before they end up in production as well as incorporating multiple browsers and mobile viewports in the tests.
3. Automating routine processes like CLA checking, closing stale pull requests and helping resolve merge conflicts and build failures by notifying the maintainer-on-duty and the pull request authors."
Oppia Foundation,Nithesh N. Hariharan,Generalized Review System,"This project aims to introduce a system to introduce a suggestion-review system which would allow the community to contribute to the content on Oppia. It also aims to add a review system to allow easy management of the proposed suggestions and accept or reject them as appropriate. In order to maintain quality of reviews, we allow reviews from users who have made above a certain number of contributions in similar kind of suggestions. For each exploration the creator of the exploration can appoint some trusted reviewers who will be able to accept (merge) content related suggestions for that exploration. At a site-wide level, translation reviewers can be selected for each language and they can accept translations for that particular language."
Oppia Foundation,Nitish Bansal,Rich Text Editor Upgrade,"The aim of this project is to upgrade Oppia’s Rich Text Editor (RTE), which authors use to create lesson content. The current RTE, based on textAngular, cannot render previews of certain rich-text components during editing. TextAngular editor will be replaced by CKEditor to achieve desired functionality."
Oppia Foundation,Sandeep Dubey,Lesson Translation Dashboard,"A lesson translation dashboard for oppia's audio translators. This dashboard will help audio translators to do translation in a much better way. Through this project a lot of new features will be added to the translation dashboard:
- Translation status of the entire exploration in the preferred language.
- Translation status of each state in the preferred language.
- Translation status of each component of the state (content/responses/hints/feedback).
- Audio recording.
- Bulk audio upload.
- Progress bar for the translation work."
Oppia Foundation,Vibhor Agarwal,New Interactions project.,This project aims at implementing two new interactions- *Number with units* and *Drag and drop Sorting* interactions. It will create a new learner experience at Oppia in the form of interactions inside the explorations and will aim at improving the learner's skills.
Oppia Foundation,pranavsid98,Visualizing Learner Playthroughs,"The aim of this project is to provide lesson creators a tool for visualizing how learners play through their explorations. In particular, it would be nice if the creator could see problematic playthroughs of the learners. These could be the playthroughs that lead learners to quit the lesson early, or submit multiple incorrect answers consecutively, or to repeatedly traverse a set of cards in a cyclic fashion.

The playthrough identification is targeted at individual learners whereas the current statistical data aggregation provides the creator with bulk numbers recorded. Through this tool, the creators can effectively identify problematic areas in their lessons and address them appropriately."
P2PSP.org,Prayas Sahni,WebRTC implementation of NTS,P2PSP is an application layer protocol designed for the real-time streaming of multimedia content over the Internet.To make P2PSP and WebRTC compatible the project aims to implement NAT traversal set of rules as an WebRTC/javascript implementation.Since the WEBRTC uses ICE framework for NAT traversal which further relies on TURN servers.The project aims to circumvent through the existing framework such that implementation completely relies on the STUN servers/splitter thereby eliminating the need for TURN.
P2PSP.org,sachinsngh165,Enhancements to P2PSP Simulator,"# Enhancement to P2PSP simulator
### Abstract
- **Translating Unix socket to internet socket** would make the testing a lot more easier. As P2PSP core implementation is in C++ which is quite fast, but making any changes can be quite challenging. Making a simulator would help us to visualize any changes made in algorithms and protocols. If we can replace Unix sockets with internet socket, then it will become quite easier to make changes in actual production code.
- **Use of pyqtgraph library as an alternative to matplotlib**. Use of matplotlib for real-time plotting is such a mess. PyQtGraph could be a very good alternative for all the plotting purposes. As main motive of pyqtgraph library is to enhancing the speed for real-time plotting.

This project would be a milestone for other production projects. As it would make visualisation of ideas a lot easier."
P2PSP.org,theglitch,Development of a tracker of splitters.,Trackers for splitters is a tool  that is useful to keep track of peers and splitters in a network and also helps in load balancing in peak hours. The tracker is supposed to act like a gateway for incoming peers where direct address resolution of splitters are not possible (Similar to trackers in torrent protocols)
PEcAn Project,Chaitanya Reddy,Scientific Visualization,"PEcAn project provides tools for modeling and forecasting in ecosystems. Although many ecosystem models are supported by PEcAn, presentation of results will be a challenge as it needs to reach various range of audience. Visualizing the model results would be a best way of presenting results. In this project current visualizations will be revamped/updated adding features like lazy loading, toggling plots and others to be more user interactive. Moreover this project involves in fixing issues/bugs in current shiny applications. This project is much extended in developing novel utilities, refining UI, novel analysis and many others features/tools to strengthen visualizations. A powerful/robust platform with many interactive visualization tools for model simulations is expected at the end of the project."
PEcAn Project,Liam Burke,Improve User Interface of the Data Ingest Workflow in PEcAn,"Ingesting data into PEcAn is currently a user-hostile process for researchers. To simplify this process, the PEcAn team would benefit from an application that can download datasets from any data federation, and parse the metadata so that it can be automatically read into PEcAn. To help further them in this direction, I will create an ingest workflow for a single data federation, DataOne, as a proof of concept. This app will be able to resolve data by doi. I will also add drag and drop functionality to facilitate downloading data from unsupported data federations. This app will then facilitate the process of selecting the correct semantics necessary in order to ingest data into BETYdb (the PEcAn database) by walking the user through this complex process. This app will also serve future development by creating a probability distribution of the semantics selected by the users. This distribution can be used to train a machine learning algorithm that will suggest semantic selection with greater accuracy in the future."
PMD,Akshat Bahety,Code Better,"To implement Complete Java 10 support to make sure PMD is there for all the amazing developers who upgrade to the new Java version.

 And create an Improved UI designer to help even novice java developers to harness the power of PMD and help them  code better."
PMD,Binguo Bao,Automated regression tests against real-world projects,"A regression testing tool is created to ensure that new problems and unexpected behaviors will not be introduced to PMD project after fixing an issue , and new rules can work as expected."
Performance Co-Pilot,Andreas Gerstmayr,Extending BCC support for Performance Co-Pilot and Vector,"BCC (BPF Compiler Collection) is a toolkit for efficient kernel tracing using eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filters). This project extends the current PCP BCC PMDA (Performance Metrics Domain Agent) by adding advanced BCC tools for system introspection and extends Vector with new widgets that expose these collected metrics. The collected metrics include block device I/O latency, latency of the open/read/write/fsync operations for ext4, xfs and zfs, per-process disk I/O time, TCP session and retransmit details, per-process TCP throughput, scheduler run queue latency and process details of new processes."
Performance Co-Pilot,Andrii Dehtiariov,PCP Windows Installer,"The general goal of this project is to provide perfect user experience for users of Performance Co-Pilot on
Windows. Now Windows port of Performance Co-Pilot can be built on Fedora Linux. That requires
configurated Fedora operating system with all necessary packages. Additionally, users must be experienced
in building from source and packaging. All mentioned reduces scalability, integrity and use cases of PCP
framework. Users may try to find relatively easier ways to gain their demands. Additionally, there are
problems with sending patches and updates to users which can potentially cause even security risks. So,
there is no need in further explanation of the utility of this project."
Performance Co-Pilot,CVN Prajwal,RESP (Redis) support in pmproxy,"So as to handle  huge volumes of data generated due to distributed and scalable nature of PCP, Redis an in-memory NoSQL data cache is being used in PCP for search and serving time series performance data.  Since PCP metadata and data keys are distributed across potentially many Redis servers, Redis nodes need to communicate with one another for data access/transfer. Communication between Redis nodes (Redis clients with the Redis servers) is carried out by protocol called RESP (REdis Serialization Protocol). As Redis protocol (RESP) and the pmproxy'd PCP protocol can co-exist, the main goal of this project is extending pmproxy to support RESP such that an arbitrary Redis client can access the distributed key store using the direct key-to-server mapping mechanism used by the existing PCP time series code. Sub-goals include integrating libuv library with pmproxy. libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O."
Performance Co-Pilot,Guillem Lopez Paradis,Metadata Label Support for instrumented Applications,"This project will explore extending a new feature for the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP). PCP is an open source framework at the system level that monitors, analyze and retrieve information to understand system performance. It has a distributed architecture of agents, called Performance Metric Domain Agents (PMDA), that extract performance values from the desired environments or systems.

Every agent (PMDA) reports to a centralized daemon called Performance Metric Collection Daemon or PMCD per host. Then, accessing any metric is as easy as sending a request to PMCDs. PCP has several client tools to help the final user understand the metrics. Finally, PCP also offers a good API to create an agent for any software.

Coming back to the interest of the proposal, PCP also supports instrumentation. This is a way to enable user applications like Firefox to send metrics in execution time to the PMDA. In this scenario, Memory Mapped Values (MMV) are used to offer an extremely lightweight mechanism for instrumenting applications using shared memory. However, there is no support for metadata labels added since the newest v4, and hence the goal of this project: add label support for instrumentation."
Performance Co-Pilot,Parth Verma,Mac OS X PCP Installer,"The proposal explains how the project ""Mac OS X PCP Installer"" will be completed in the required duration with all the dependencies, requirements and testing completed in the mentorship of  Nathan Scott and Paul Smith. It has all the details of timeline, goals, breakdown of the whole procedure of making both the installers brew version and DMG(GUI) version. The proposal also contains details about my previous experience and why that is relevant to the completion of this project."
Plone,Ajay NS,GatsbyJS Integration with Plone,"Gatsby is a blazing fast static site generator for React. The idea is to develop a gatsby-source plugin that pulls the whole content tree from the plone.restapi and make it available for querying via GraphQL in a hierarchical data structure. A basic Gatsby starter will also be built that uses the data from the plugin, following the styles of Pastanaga UI with it's reusable components."
Plone,Akshay,Command Line Plone Tools,This project is about improving plonecli and bobtemplates
Plone,Nilesh Gulia,create-react-app for plone-react,"The idea is to make Plone-react package
as a dependency to other packages and make ( use ) a create-react-app like app
generator to generate the example boilerplate which fits with the package. By doing this
we don’t need to fork the repo everytime, just execute the command
create-plone-react-app like so and we’ll be good to go."
Plone,Shriyanshagro,IFTTT plugin for Plone,"At present, Plone have content rules to accomplish use-cases(provided by IFTTT) but with additionally written scripts. So the soul spirit behind this idea is to build a generalized mechanism which lets people integrate Plone with plugins/platforms outside of Plone environment with a little programming and easy UX."
Pocket Science Lab,Abhinav Raj,Upgrading the PSLab Android Application,PSLab (Pocket Science Lab) is an Open Source hardware device (open on all layers). The Android App for PSLab aims to run PSLab device in android smartphones.This proposal offers to upgrade PSLab Android App by implementing all the leftover functionalities in the Android App.
Pocket Science Lab,Madhushanka Padmal,Pocket Science Lab - GSoC '18,"**Pocket Science Lab** by FOSSASIA is a electronic measurement and analytical tool. This helps students, teachers, undergraduates and hobbyists in numerous ways in their academics as well as projects.

The project currently facilitates PSLab interfaces with *Android* and *Desktop* platforms. Desktop application is rather complete but the Android application is not. Both the applications need improvements more or less. The expected outcome by the end of this summer is to make these platforms fully functional with ease of use. Apart from these platforms, a *Web* interface will also be developed.

These three complete platforms will increase the usability of **PSLab** device over almost any systems, be it Windows, Linux, Mac or Android. User will not have to spend hundreds of dollars on costly equipments to help with their projects and practicals anymore."
Polly Labs,Andrei Lascu,Metamorphic Testing for Math Libraries,"Recently, metamorphic testing techniques have been applied with success in
various fields to find domain-specific bugs, as presented in [this survey][1].
One field yet to be explored is that of programming libraries, which comes with
its own set of challenges. The existance of multiple libraries means we have a
rich set of equivalence relations we can employ for metamorphic
relations, allowing extensive testing using this approach. This project aims to
explore the suitability of applying metamorphic testing to these math libraries
and evaluate their reliability and correctness.

Polly Labs,Pankaj Kukreja,Collect Polyhedral Benchmarks,"Currently, Polly’s performance is measured on PolyBench benchmark. PolyBench does not cover all of the possible kernels so we may miss out some kernels where a particular transformation does not perform well. This project will help to get new benchmarks for measuring Polly’s performance benefits. The benchmarks will be added to LLVM test suite."
Polly Labs,Sahil Yerawar,Compiling Chapel with Polly/LLVM,"Chapel is an emerging parallel programming language developed with the aim of providing better performance in High-Performance Computing as well as accessibility to the newcomer programmers in order to provide a relatively smoother learning curve in Parallel Computing.

Polly, a polyhedral compilation based optimization tool, performs data-locality based optimizations and automatic parallelization of LLVM IR represented in Polyhedral format. The resultant polyhedra are exposed to a number of loop optimizations like tiling, vectorization and strip mining.

I propose to integrate Polly’s Optimization passes in Chapel. In today’s world, it is well known that High-Performance Computing involves nested loops as one of their most compute intensive parts which are efficiently handled by Polly-based optimizations, hereby making HPC more productive and going towards more compute-intensive problems which are currently unfeasible."
PostgreSQL,Hongyuan Ma,"""Develop Performance Farm Database and Website"" proposal for Google Summer of Code 2018","I plan to implement the PerfFarm project using a separate front-end and back-end development approach and use PostgreSQL as a database for storing test results.The front-end project will be built using React16. Bootstrap will be used as the ui library and Yarn will be the package manager. 

The backend project will import Django Rest Framework on top of existing Django. And the Django version will be upgraded to the latest TLS version, which is now 1.11. There will be no html file in the backend project. Front-end and back-end applications will use restful apis to exchange data.

In addition, the backend project will have an admin module. Only administrators of the PG Performance Farm project can log in to the admin module. In the admin module, the administrator has the ability to modify the machine's submission rights, send registration confirmation emails, and so on."
PostgreSQL,Kefan Yang,Sorting Algorithms Benchmark and Implementation,"Implement the project idea [sorting algorithms benchmark and implementation (2018)](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/GSoC_2018#Sorting_algorithms_benchmark_and_implementation_.282018.29)

Candidate sorting algorithms: 
- Introsort
- Timsort
- Dual-pivot quicksort
- Radixsort

Use cuckoo hashing as the new hashing table implementation"
PostgreSQL,Yan Cui,implement pg_thrift plugin for postgreSQL,"One of advantages of document-oriented databases like MongoDB or Couchbase over RDBMSs is an ability to change the data scheme easily, fast and often. The traditional approach in RDBMS world involves doing an expensive ALTER TABLE operation, slow upgrade of an existing data, and stuff like this. This approach is often slow and inconvenient for application developers.
To solve this issue PostgreSQL provides JSON and JSONB datatypes. Unfortunately JSONB has a disadvantage of storing all documents keys, which is a lot of redundant data.
One possibility to to reduce JSONB redundancy is to use zson extension. It compresses JSONB documents using shared dictionary of common strings that appear in all or most documents. This approach has its limitations though. Particularly, since data schema evolves, the dictionary has to be updated from time to time. Also zson can affect the build-in mechanism of PostgreSQL of compressing data using PGLZ algorithm since this mechanism uses some heuristics to recognize data that compresses well. Thus sometimes zson can reduce the overall performance.
The idea of this project is to create an extension that provides Thrift support which solves zson problem."

Public Lab,Gaurav Sachdeva,Email Integration project,"**Email Integration Project** consists of four major parts - 
1. Reply by Email to comment: This feature would allow a user to comment on the research note or question posted at PublicLab just by replying back to the notification email they received regarding the question.
2. Weekly Digest: Implementation of feature by which an email would be sent to each user of Public Lab containing his/her liked topics updates. 
3. UI for email notification settings: I have designed the user-interface which would allow users to customize their experience with PublicLab's website.
4. Unpublished Draft Creation: This feature would allow users to save their research note as a draft so that user can complete it anytime. It would also allow a user to generate a secret link which he/she can share with specific users to have their review of his work."
Public Lab,Margaret Norton,Computer Vision enhancements for Raspberry Pi based Public Lab Science Projects,"The project would provide a series of modular python programs that could be used to support different Public Lab imaging and spectrum measurement toolkits.  The programs enable near real time OpenCV computer vision (CV) measurements of images or spectra.  The CV measurements can be used to improve instrument performance (feedback that controls lighting amplitude or  camera array exposure times) or assist calibration by subtracting reference images/spectra.   
General objectives include:
•	increasing the scope and usability of Public lab Spectral Workbench and spectrometer kits
•	collecting software techniques from Raspberry PI, computer vision and Adafruit  blogs into a single source that can be applied to science projects

Also integrating more features such as adding power tags to blurred locations, also creating an email subscription regarding users' location or interest in certain projects, with information about the projects embedded in maps"
Public Lab,Naman Gupta,Email integration Project,"The current implementation of Email System in PLOTS2 doesn't implement Active Jobs i.e queue feature because it is currently using rails 4.1. And rails 4.1 doesn't implement Active Jobs on its own. We have to ways to resolve this either include activejob gem or upgrade to rails 4.2 (we will go with this). So currently, mails are sended synchronously. And if the sending of mail is failed due to some reason or we don't want to send the mail at the time of request/response or if we want that a mail should be sent after (1 day or any specific period of time) we can't implement it now.
Sometimes, we have to run jobs at particular intervals to, say, backup logs, send emails, etc. In rails application we can schedule such tasks using the whenever gem.
For integrating cron jobs with the plots2 we can implement whenever gem which will be very useful in sending daily ""batch digest"" email to the subscribers. We can specify the time when the email should be sent. More details on implementation is in Implementation part.
Another feature is the reply-by-email feature using mailman gem.
Feature that we can implement is of reply by tweet which is very convenient and easy for the user to do."

This will be achieved by implementing a package for interactive 3D visualization of human brain activity inside the notebooks. A working alternative to mayavi and PySurfer built on top of ipyvolume and ipywidgets will be developed. Ultimately, I will add ipyvolume as a backend to the MNE package. Export of data visualization to a variety of file formats will be added."
Python Software Foundation,Parichit Sharma,DIPY workflows and Quality Assurance,"DIPY is a highly versatile and widely used python package for analyzing diffusion MRI images. There are several modules for performing many common tasks related to MRI image analysis (such as de-noising, image registration and clustering) [1]. These modules have been under active open development as a community initiative and have been well-tested. In this proposal, I will focus on extending the core functionality by building workflows that can achieve various tasks (varying from simple image registration to image de-noising, clustering etc. in an automated manner). These workflows will be powerful abstractions for the domain users (specifically medical practitioners) to achieve several tasks related to diffusion MRI image analysis with minimal manual intervention."
Python Software Foundation,Sangeet Kumar Mishra,Improve Functionality of hg grep | PSF | Mercurial GSoC 2018 Proposal,"The current implementation of grep in mercurial is quite counter-intuitive and not what most people would expect it to do. For example one of the most common things people want to do with grep is grep the current directory, but only files under hg control. But this is not the default behaviour of grep as of now. 

There are other issues with the --all flag which reports irrelevant revisions in the output. This project aims at fixing these issues with the grep.

**Goals of the project:**
* grep command by default should only search for the files tracked by the current working directory
* If passed a revision like: hg grep -r <rev>   then it should search on the files tracked by the revision sets passed
* Introduce a --diff option to hg grep which does exactly what hg grep --all do right now
* Deprecating the --all flag in favour of --diff.
* Fixing https://bz.mercurial-scm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3885 and other similar issues marked duplicate of this
* Documentation of all the above tasks"
Python Software Foundation,Shreyas Fadnavis,Model Fitting using Microstructure Imaging of Crossing (MIX): DIPY,"Diffusion MRI measures water diffusion in biological tissue, which can be used to probe its microstructure. The most common model for water diffusion in tissue is the diffusion tensor (DT), which assumes a Gaussian distribution. This assumption of Gaussian diffusion oversimplifies the diffusive behavior of water in complex media, and is known experimentally to break down for relatively large b-values. DT derived indices, such as mean diffusivity or fractional anisotropy, can correlate with major tissue damage, but lack sensitivity and specificity to subtle pathological changes. 
Microstructure Imaging of Crossing (MIX) is versatile and thus suitable to a broad range of generic multicompartment models, in particular for brain areas where axonal pathways cross. 

Multicompartment models (assess the variability of diffusion in sub-voxel regions) enable the estimation of more specific indices and so potentially give much greater insight into tissue architecture.

Goal of Model Fitting: Identify which model compartments are essential to explain the data and parameters that are potentially estimable from a particular experiment and compare the models to each other using the BIC."
Python Software Foundation,Stefanie Lumnitz,PySAL - Geovisualization Module,"The goal of this project is to design and implement a visualization module in PySAL, the `viz` module. This will meet the growing demand for a simple to use, lightweight interface that connects PySAL to different popular visualization toolkits. The `viz` module will ultimately provide the users with both static plots ready for publication and interactive visualizations that allow for quick iteration and data exploration. In a first phase we will therefore create different visualizations in both a static version with Matplotlib and an interactive version with Bokeh. We will then create a common API for easy access to both versions. After adding documentation we will be able to provide a complete and user friendly module. Finally, we will explore how alternative visualization packages, like Vega, could be integrated into the `viz` module in future."
Python Software Foundation,Tingyi Wanyan,Improving Tractography Through Machine Learning Techniques: DIPY,"Brain tractography is a great challenge because the brain’s structure is three dimensional and complex and it is highly uncertain if neighboring bundles cross or simply diverge. Therefore, many configurations of bundles are possible. Deterministic, probabilistic or global tracking algorithms can select only one of the possible configurations generating tractograms with a large number of false positives. In this work, the plan is to improve DIPY tracking algorithm using machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques."
Python Software Foundation,Tommy Clausner,mne.set_volumeAverage(True) - preparing Group level analyses for volumetric data,"**Neural source reconstruction** of MEG/EEG data requires subject specific geometrical data (i.e. electrode locations and anatomical brain data). For many reconstruction techniques, results are volumetric rather than surface-based. A group level analysis for volumetric data has not yet been implemented in MNE Python. The proposed project aims to fill this gap, by implementing necessary tools for group level analyses based on **volumetric data**, among which are: non-linear warping of one volumetric (grid) space to another; creating pseudo-individual anatomical MR images, based on a subject’s head shape; and output preparation, such that it can be used with already built in statistical functions. The results will be a set of Python functions that enable the user to prepare individual volumetric subject data for **group level analyses**. Furthermore the respective visualization will be targeted as well."
Python Software Foundation,Viral Mehta,Scrapinghub: Scrapy - Spider Auto Repair,"Spiders can become broken due to changes on the target site, which lead to different page layouts (therefore, broken XPath and CSS extractors). Often however, the information content of a page remains the same, just in a different form or layout. This project would concern the use of snapshotted versions of a target page, combined with extracted data from that page, to infer rules for scraping the new layout automatically. “Scrapely” is an example of a pre-existing tool that might be instrumental in this project."
Python Software Foundation,Xinquan Wu,Implementing multi-thread capacities for nonrigid registration in DIPY using OpenMP,"DIPY is an open source software mainly focusing on diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) analysis. For nonrigid image registration, it implements a Symmetric Normalization framework. The major goal of this framework is to calculate an affine or deffeomorphic transformation to register two 2D images or 3D volumes. As a well-known problem, registration is a non-convex optimization problem. It is very important to initialize as close to the solution as possible. So in order to avoid getting stuck at local optima, it uses a multi-resolution strategy by building a Gaussian Pyramid. That is to say we can register our images in as many stages as we want, providing previous results as initialization for the next. As this way, we need to do a lot of iterations, thus it slow down the optimization process.
    To speed up the calculation, one solution is to convert to a parallel computing algorithm. The OpenMP API supports multi-platform shared-memory parallel programming in C/C++ and Fortran. So in this project, I will implement a multi-thread algorithm using OpenMP to improve the performance of nonrigid image registration in DIPY."

QEMU,esposem,Qtest Driver Framework,"Testing is a very important in software development, it allows developers to find bugs and evaluate software quality. For instance, regression testing helps programmers to control the stability of the software when new features or changes are made. 
QEMU currently features hardcoded tests for every machine configuration, since each has only a limited set of drivers available to test, making it not very flexible to changes and future additions. 

The purpose of this project would be to implement a framework that uses libqos to automatically start QEMU with the right options to provide the driver requested by the unit test. The framework will essentially produce a graph of “consumes-produces” relationships between the various drivers, interfaces and unit tests, in order to understand what options to give to QEMU."

approach based on influence functions has been developed to provide an accurate estimate of standard
 errors of risk and performance of assets and portfolios for returns with both serially uncorrelated and seri-
ally correlated returns. This project involves (1) developing a new R package named InfluenceFunctions
 and (2) integrating the R package EstimatorStandardError in conjunction with InfluenceFunctions
 into the existing R package PerformanceAnalytics, with the goal of giving PerformanceAnalytics pack-

The VolEsti is a C++ software package for volume approximation and scales to a few hundreds dimensions in contrast to currently available packages. Thus it could be an essential tool for a quite large number of scientific applications that need fast volume approximation or sampling in high dimensions. The goal of this project is to provide a friendly and efficient interface of VolEsti in a high level language as R. Second to propose additions that might be useful for some scientific applications, especially in economics and in biogeography and control, by extending VolEsti. Furthermore this new R package would provide necessary tools for some other future extensions that could be used in applications in biology and optimization problems.

R project for statistical computing,Dries Cornilly,rTrawl,"Trawl processes are continuous-time processes exhibiting autocorrelation. They are determined by a Lévy seed and trawl function, which can be viewed as a news impact curve. The major advantage is that the marginal distribution can be modelled separate from the trawl function, allowing for a very flexible modelling of the autocorrelation structure exhibiting short or long memory. This class of processes has recently been applied in high frequency econometrics where it is used to describe the behaviour of financial spreads and price processes at ultra high frequencies.

Currently, there is no open source code available to replicate any of the recent academic research. Similarly, practitioners wishing to apply these methods have no dependable source code to rely on. This project aims to change this by building a coherent simulation and estimation framework for both univariate and multivariate trawl processes. With this R package, users can apply the novel methodology to any application of interest, without having to worry about implementing the methods first. This way, research in trawl processes and the list of possible applications can only grow."
R project for statistical computing,Gregory Brownson,A Shiny User Interface to RobStatTM,"# Project Summary
The goal of this project is to develop a point-and-click graphical user interface (GUI) for the RobStatTM package. Both the UI and package will complement the second edition of Robust Statistics: Theory and Methods (RSTM) by Maronna, R., Martin, R.D., Yohai, V.J., and Salibian-Barrera, M, to be published in 2018. As of now, RobStatTM is only available to R command line users, resulting in a steep learning curve for effective use of the robust methods outlined in RSTM and the RobStatTM package. We believe the inclusion of a UI will allow for a more intuitive approach to understanding robust methods and, thus, lead to a more widespread and effective use of the RobStatTM package in both university courses where these methods are applicable and among practicing statisticians and financial professionals, the ladder of which uses R extensively."

In the face of multiple threats related to Global Change, protection and mitigation actions are crucial for maintaining the health of the planet, and knowing where species are located constitutes in primary information for starting these efforts. Currently, generation of species ranges maps may take several steps and the use of specialized software. Thanks to the recent development of specialized packages, R is rapidly becoming an excellent alternative for analyzing the spatial patterns of biodiversity. Taking advantage of this packages and the versatility of R, the aim of this project is offering handily and robust open source tools to obtain reliable proposals of species distribution ranges and to analyze their geographical patterns. A large community of students, researchers, and conservation managers will be benefited by this project since these tools will be freely available and will improve the way in which studies of species distributions are developed."
R project for statistical computing,Parismita Das,Max Margin Interval Trees,"There are few R packages available for interval regression, a machine learning problem which is important in genomics and medicine. Like usual regression, the goal is to learn a function that inputs a feature vector and outputs a real-valued prediction. Unlike usual regression, each output in the training set is an interval of acceptable values (rather than one value). In the terminology of the survival analysis literature, this is regression with “left, right, and interval censored” output/response data.

Max margin interval trees is a new nonlinear model for this problem (Drouin et al., 2017). A dynamic programming algorithm is used to find the optimal split point for each feature. The dynamic programming algorithm has been implemented in C++ and there are wrappers to this solver in R and Python (https://github.com/aldro61/mmit). The Python package includes a decision tree learner. However there is not yet an implementation of the decision tree learner in the R package.

R project for statistical computing,Thiloshon Nagarajah,bdclean: User friendly biodiversity data cleaning pipeline,"Until recently, biodiversity data was scattered in different formats in natural history collections, survey reports, and in literature. In the last fifteen years, lot of efforts are being made to establish standards in the biodiversity database structure and to centralize the data for better accessibility. But the data gathered by such entities does not enforce strong data quality standards. These sources often tend to be prone to many flaws. Thus the data retrieved from centralized sources needs to go through a well formed quality-control process to be used in researches.

Bdclean was created for that same purpose. So far we have been able to create numerous quality checks, work-flows, analyses and visualization functionalities in the taxonomical, spatial and temporal aspects. But all these remain as standalone components without much synchronization or connectivity. We propose to refine the overall data cleaning pipeline of bdclean and bring synergy to all the developed components as well as develop new important functionalities. At the end of this project, users will be able go through the quality control process in a very structured, intuitive and effective way."

In this project, we aim to add an state-of-the-art approach to the R packages for analyzing treatment effects changing over time at individual levels based on the observed EHR time series. The current R packages have limitations of using simple methods like linear models or propensity score matching to estimate average treatment effects in the population or at subgroup levels, which ignores the heterogeneity in the large observed data. Besides, these packages only focus on point-in-time estimates. We fill in the gap and provide a more comprehensive Bayesian nonparametric method for analyzing individual treatment effects on modern EHR data that are usually irregularly sampled time sequences and exposed to treatments multiple times."

It is an Open API, for this we need to implement header files and methods related to the header files. It includes a porting of function from FreeBSD as well as NetBSD for various file system including NFS and FAT file System. It pertains the OS, not the file system specifically, but a part of this API is used to access file system."

Another contribution will be to train a **dialect identification** model to perform Arabic dialect identification on the Television news corpus.
Red Hen Lab,Ajinkya Takawale,Audio and Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) using Deep Learning,"Now, it is common for news videos to incorporate both auditory and visual modalities. Developing a multi-modal Speech to Text model seems very tempting for these datasets. The next goal is to develop a multi-modal Speech to Text system (AVSR) by extracting visual modalities and concatenating them to the previous inputs.

This project would extend already implemented previous GSOC candidate Divesh Pandey's speech recognition project.[\[1\]](https://github.com/pandeydivesh15/AVSR-Deep-Speech) The implemented work was based on the paper Deep Speech [\[2\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5567) but the authors of the original paper have proposed the second version of the same, Deep Speech 2 [\[3\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02595) which is completely End-to-End solution with no hand engineered features and also more efficient. I will primarily focus on using methods that are more accurate and robust in terms of computing power.

Red Hen Lab,Burhan Ul Tayyab,Russian Ticker Tape OCR,"We are proposing an OCR framework for recognizing ticker text in Russian Videos. We do this by solving two main problems, improving the OCR by implementing a Recurrent Neural Network, with a 1-dimensional (1-d) Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory (BDLSTM) architecture for Tensorflow which gives better results than Tesseract, and we solve the Scrolling Ticker problem by proposing an algorithm (Early Fusion) which checks the tickers and combine them in correct order."
Red Hen Lab,Cynthia Hsu,Automatic Speech Recognition for Speech-to-Text on Chinese,"In this project, a Speech-to-Text conversion engine on Chinese is established, resulting in a working application.

There are two leading candidates for idea implementation:
1. A Tensorflow implementation for Chinese speech recognition based on DeepMind’s WaveNet. Although WaveNet was designed as a generative model, it can straightforwardly be adapted to discriminative audio tasks such as speech recognition. The paper omitted specific details about the implementation, we can fill the gaps in our own way in this project.
2. A Tensorflow implementation for Chinese speech recognition based on Baidu's DeepSpeech. Mozilla's DeepSpeech project is an open source Speech-To-Text engine, using a model trained by machine learning techniques. It is a well-known open source project on Github, therefore we can make our own breakthroughs based on the existing framework in this project.

Since these two architecture are both based on Tensorflow, we can actually refer both of the architectures when designing our own network. In this project, we can use THCHS-30, Chinese news from two CCTV channels, two Hunan regional channels, and one Changsha local channel to train our model."
Red Hen Lab,Devendra Yadav,Emotion detection and characterization in video using CNN-RNN,"This project aims to develop a pipeline for emotion detection using video frames. Specifically, we detect and analyze faces present in the video using deep neural networks for emotion recognition. We use a CNN and RNN based on papers submitted to Emotion Recognition In The Wild Challenge. An input video will be broken into small segments. For each segment, we will detect, crop, and align faces. This gives us a sequence of face images. A CNN will extract relevant features for each image in the sequence. These features will be sequentially fed to a RNN which will encode motion and facial expressions to predict emotion. The complete process will be implemented as a Python API with video input and JSON annotation output. Tensorflow, dlib, MTCNN and ffmpeg are used for various tasks in the project."
Red Hen Lab,GYANESH MALHOTRA,Multi modal Egocentric Perception (with video and eye tracking data),This project aims to tackle the problem of egocentric activity recognition based on the information available from two modalities which are video and eye tracking data. It achieves this by the fusion of multi stream convnet architecture to learn the spatial and temporal features from video data. It also makes use of the object saliency detection obtained from eye tracking data to further improve the identification of activity based on its surrounding.
Red Hen Lab,KRANTI WADHAI,Forced Alignment and adding Spanish language support to Gentle.,"Speech Recognition has been fascinating area of research ,it's application are innumerable. Gentle Aligner has been used for forced alignment of English .Currently most speech recognition are based on Hidden Markov Model(HMM), a statistical framework which make many assumptions which  limit their potential effectively.Neural networks avoid many of these assumption,can also learn complex function,generalize effectively.Gentle uses Artificial neural network as acoustic model.
My proposal is on extending language support of Gentle to Spanish.Since Spanish is one of the most spoken languages 
in world, people who can used speech to text in Spanish would be large.Speech recognition has application in  field such as law enforcement,mobile phones.
More details about acoustic model and language model is presented in proposal. Documentation of full procedure will be part of this project."
Red Hen Lab,Sumit Vohra,"Multimodal Egocentric Perception (with video, audio, eyetracking data)","Hey, I have been in constant touch with Mehul regarding my project on Multi-modal Egocentric Perception. I have already had a skype meet with him before drafting this final pre-proposal. 

Abstract: The idea of the project is to introduce multimodality in recognizing everyday activities and scenes. As per today, no work has been done now which includes multimodality into account (especially audio ) to determine the kind of activities and scenes that person is involved when it comes to egocentric perception. I have already built an audio-based model based on popular IEEE-DCASE-challenge which can successfully classify scenes into categories like ( person is walking in a park, driving in a car ) for egocentric views. I plan to extend my work as part of gsoc-2k18 to incorporate my model with video-based models and increase the scope of model from scenes to scenes+activities. The final breakdown of the steps is submitted in the pre-proposal attached above. The idea is to built pyscene-detect for egocentric videos,  which would be a prominent contribution owing to growing research in the area of first person view  videos."
Red Hen Lab,Vaibhav Gupta-1,Rapid Annotator,"With Red Hen Lab’s Rapid Annotator we try to enable researchers worldwide to _**annotate large chunks of data**_ in a very short period of time with least effort possible and try to get started with minimal training.

Rapid annotator is currently a proof-of-concept rather than a finished product. This project aims to deliver a usable product by the end of Google Code of Summer. The **final product** would be a complete tool for fast and simple classification of datasets and an _**administrative interface**_ for the experimenters where they can conduct their annotation runs. It broadly comprises of 3 steps, namely
+ Uploading their datasets to setup the experiment.
+ Assigning annotators datasets for annotation.
+ Keeping a track of the annotation progress.

The main aim of the pre-project phase is to do _**requirements gathering**_, analysis and _**designing**_ the complete system architecture. The project phase will deal with implementing the architecture finally decided upon"

The most important part is Speech Recognition. Since there are few guidences about how to use DeepSpeech model to train Chinese, I will pay more attention to this part and train a model as soon as possible."
RoboComp,Akash Kumar Singh,Gazebo-RoboComp Integration,"Simulation plays an important role in robotics. Through simulation we can save valuable time and resources to test our algorithms. Often robotics require expensive sensors and hardware which is not accessible to everyone. 

Currently RoboComp uses RoboComp Innermodel Simulator (RCIS), an inbuilt simulator, to check its applications and algorithms. It provides a lot of basic tools and features to easily test and verify an application developed by a developer. But it has some shortcomings.

To my understanding, the aim of this project is to provide a platform for the developers to quickly check the changes and validity of the application developed by them. To integrate the RoboComp framework and Gazebo simulator in such a way that it inherits the structure of RoboComp interface, uses the features provided by Gazebo to its fullest and is able to fulfill the needs of developer in the most efficient way."
RoboComp,Araceli Vega Magro,Improving the Human-centered Robot Navigation Agent,"My proposal consists on transform the fixed personal space used actually in Robocomp into an adaptive space, depending of the spatial context (there is difference, for instance, between a narrow corridor and a room).  The main idea is to change the values that defines the personal space function in order to adapt the personal space to allow the robot to navigate around the person without problems, adapting it to the spatial context.  Besides, I would like to extend the social navigation agent, including other typical social behaviors: crossing people in corridors, approaching to humans in human-robot interaction, etc. In this respect, it would be interesting to study how these algorithms are also integrated into the planner and mission agents, and how define the priority between these missions by defining a social behavior planner."
RoboComp,CristinaMG,RCIS: improving RoboComp simulator with contact physics.,"I think about how to improve the RoboComp simulator with its planes and meshes, which provides the programmer all the information needed to start implement a new version. I have used RoboComp before and I know that it has not graphic physics, so I propose a model with collisions to improve this part. RCIS is too important because it allows testing without a real environment or the physic robot, so the better and more efficient it is, the more useful it will be for a new project development."
RoboComp,José Alberto Andújar,JavaScript support,"My proposal is based on getting full support for JavaScript within the RoboComp framework. For this, the current state of generation of written components in the JavaScript language must be improved. Last year during the 2017 GSoC the functionality of the RoboComp component generator was extended to provide component supports based on NodeJS. A first approximation was achieved but still lacks robustness, reliability and should be extended to include more features.
In addition, recently Zeroc ICE has added support for JavaScript interfaces, therefore the component generator must be extended to support this feature, both as a server and as a client. The component model of RoboComp must be able to generate components in this language with the same functionality as its counterparts in C ++ and Python, thus achieving complete support for JavaScript within RoboComp."
RoboComp,Maria Bohórquez,"Generation of new use cases, tutorials and reference information for RoboComp","Robocomp current tutorials are simple and cover just the basics. Improved tutorials and use cases need to be created for Robocomp to be a framework friendly for beginners as well as more advanced users.

Working on creating examples of how Robocomp can be implemented, and why it should be used, would make it more accessible to the general public. As will improving the ""How to Contribute Page"", and making pull requests templates would make it easier to collaborate for more advance developers. 

Getting Robocomp available in other operating systems it's necessary to making it more well-known, in other Linux distros as well as Windows. This can be done with virtual machines images or making tutorials to download it with their respective dependencies on each OS.

In summary, Robocomp would be benefited from offering a better user experience and a more seamlessly transition for collaborators to work on it."
RoboComp,Mayank Kumar-1,Extending RCManager functionalities,"RCManager is a graphic deployment tool for working with the robotic components of RoboComp. It is an indispensable tool for managing highly complex robots which ultimately pose themselves as large-scale distributed systems and is based on the popularly used MVC architecture.  

My earlier GSoC project effected the implementation of all the core components of RCManager. This year, I intend to develop additional features for the RCManager, which includes important tools like the edge prober, and the component list retriever. Apart from these, a number of trivial GUI options (like an exhaustive menu bar) would be added to enhance the usability of this tool. Since this tool deals with components being deployed at remote locations, the involved functionalities would require extensive testing and documentation. My objective is to enable us release an initial beta version of this tool by the end of this year's program."
RoboComp,Piyush Pilaniya,Integrating MORSE Human-robot interaction simulator with RoboComp,"The aim of the project is to integrate the Morse as an additional tool for the simulation in the RoboComp framework. Currently, RoboComp uses RoboComp InnerModel Simulator (RCIS) tool for the simulation which has several limitation. Thus the idea would be simply to utilise the feature of Morse in the RoboComp architecture for better and improved simulations.Morse is generic simulator for academic robots. It comes with a set of standard sensors, actuators and robots which fulfils the demand. It uses OpenGL-based Blender Game Engine that supports 3D rendering and Integrated Bullet Library for physics simulation. RCIS have several limitation related to Human-robot Interaction. Therefore, integrating with Morse is beneficiary."

This idea involves the extension of the Learnblock programming tool to manage collaborative robotics between learnbots. I will develop a system that enables Learnbot to communicate between and offer this option through the learnblock tool to the end user. Finally a use case example of these collaborative robotics tool will be developed and tutorials produced for future users and developers of the platform.
RoboComp,Sayali Deshpande,Emotion Recognition Component for Learnbot,"Presently, Learnbot can be programmed to show emotions via a display. However, it does not have the ability to recognize emotions. Having this ability would help improve the Human-Robot Interaction(HRI) functions in Learnbot.

This project aims at applying state-of-the-art techniques to create a fast, accurate and robust emotion recognizer. It would be able to recognize 7 basic emotions: Happiness, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, Surprise, Fear and Neutral.

I propose a deep learning based approach using Convolutional Neural Networks. In order to make the recognizer more robust and improve the results, I propose different data augmentation techniques and methods to analyze emotions recognized over time."

Rocket.Chat,Samar Sunkaria,Adding support for theming and removing the dependency on the deprecated SlackTextViewController,"The Rocket.Chat+ team for iOS has been working on improving the UI, which comes with a major app re-design for version 3.0.0. One of their requirements to support this redesign is to add support for theming the application. This is why theming is one of the components of the this proposal. With the ability to theme, one of the areas the app can use a redesign is the text input bar.

Rocket.Chat+ for iOS uses a nice open-sourced project by Slack, called the SlackTextViewController (SLK-TVC). It is a very simple-to-use replacement for the generic UITableViewController, which provides a text input bar at the bottom of the screen for a chat app.

Sadly, Slack has stopped developing on this project, and iOS has moved on a lot since that time. Officially the SLK-TVC is only supported on iOS 7 through iOS 9. Making changes to support the newer features of iOS is getting harder and because of that, the development by the community on the project is at a stand-still.

This is why I would like to work on removing the dependency of the SLK-TVC on Rocket.Chat+ and writing a modern replacement for it, which would serve the future versions of iOS. And this time in Swift."

Technically, the high effective and efficient garbage collection management in JRuby and Rubinius thanks to the underlying virtual machine and more modern GC algorithms. These GC algorithms are also used partly for reference in Ruby GenGC.

Ruby on Rails,Yao Jie Lim,Modernising Error Pages,"The Rails website and welcome page was redesigned. However, the current design of error pages doesn't follow the new style. The new styling can be made more consistent.

Moreover, some pages display errors that require action from the user like when the migrations are pending. I would like to propose a mechanism for users to act on the errors straight from the error page. A new module for ActionableError can be designed and integrated with the new error pages to give greater control to the user. It should also be extendable by other gems for them to customize their own course of actions when an actionable error is hit. 

A Web Console integration will also be done to update the console style to fit the look and feel of the new redesign.

In addition to these ideas, we can also attempt a series of opinionated rails generators that will create a suite of default error pages (404 and 500s for example), based on the new styling rules, or from a set of styles obtained from the application's implemented stylesheets."

There is no builtin trace visualizer in HPX which would allow for better understanding of program execution. To tackle this currently, the workaround used is to use the APEX library to generate trace files using the OTF2 library so that these could be loaded into a licensed software called Vampir. Although this works, the need for the license to be able to visualize the traces seems a bit restrictive. Apart from this, a custom simple text profiler is utilized which allows for dumping start and end times which are then loaded in nvprof using python scripts for visualization. But given that HPX can be used to work on a huge number of tasks, nvprof cannot handle large traces. Additionally, separate python scripts are employed for the task of generating plots and histograms depicting useful information. Ravel is another tool that already exists and has a nice GUI but lacks certain features that would be useful for the developers of HPX. This project aims at creating a single tool to address all above-mentioned problems allowing for more productive use of HPX."
Sage Mathematical Software System,Dario Asprone,Checking graph isomorphism using the Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm,"Currently SageMath checks for graph isomorphism through an internal package with a corresponding method, called *isomorphic* and contained in **sage.groups.perm_gps.partn_ref.refinement_graphs**. This method, in addition to being quite convoluted and without much documentation about its inner workings, was last updated in a significant manner in 2011.  
The project aims at creating a new package which implements an efficient in practice heuristic method to check if two graphs are isomorphic, using one of the members of the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) algorithm hierarchy. An attempt was made in the past at the same task (but with a narrower scope, limited to only implementing the second order version of the WL algorithm), but the code was found to contain a bug and was never implemented/removed from the codebase (see Trac #10482).  
To the best of my knowledge, this would be the first working open-source implementation of k-WL, for k > 1."

Sage Mathematical Software System,Raghukul Raman,Rational Point on Varieties,"This project aims at implementing basic algorithms for finding rational points on varieties. Classically algebraic variety is defined as the set of solutions of polynomial equations over a number field. A rational point of an algebraic variety is a solution of set of equations in the given field (rational field if not mentioned). Much of the number theory can be viewed as the study of rational point of algebraic varieties. Some of the great achievements of number theory amount to determining the rational points on particular curves.
For example, Fermat’s last theorem is equivalent to the statement that for an integer n ≥ 3, the only rational point of the curve xn+yn=zn in P2 over Qare the obvious ones.  Common variants of these question include determining the set of all points of V(K) of height up to some bound. The aim of this project is to implement some basic rational point finding algorithms (sieving modulo prime and enumeration) and extend these to product_projective_space scheme."

These modules can later be used as pre-processing for several graph problems such as Hamiltonian Cycle, traveling salesman problem."
Scala,Ilya Kirillov,Debugger integration for Scala Native,Scala Native is a Scala compiler which produces native code by using LLVM compiler infrastructure. LLVM supports special meta information about programs source code. Such information can be added to the generated IL code and then be used by debuggers. That will allow to use common debug tools like GDB or LLDB to work with Scala applications. The target of this project is to generate such kind of information in Scala Native compiler.

Seastar,Ryan Huang,TCP BBR implementation in Seastar,"TCP BBR was proposed as a modern TCP congestion control algorithm by Google in 2016. The traditional loss-based TCP algorithms like TCP CUBIC, reduce their sending rates greatly when detecting packet loss, and increase rates conservatively when no packets loss happens. However, it is hard to estimate the network condition just on basis of one metric, i.e, packet loss. As a consequence, loss-based TCP algorithms underutilize network during most of the time, but cause severe congestion occasionally. 

TCP BBR is a new variation of TCP algorithm which adjusts its sending rate based on the real-time network metric, i.e, packet round trip time (RTT), the delivered rate (goodput). It is optimal that the amount of traffic walking through a network link is just equal to the well-known bandwidth delay production (BDP). Hence, TCP BBR uses RTT and goodput to constrict the amount of traffic in flight is equal to BDP. In this way, TCP BBR can maximize the goodput, and minimize the RTT at the same time.

As a high-performance network stack, it is very important for Seastar to provide such high-performance TCP algorithm to further upgrade the performance."
Seastar,Zhongze Liu,"Implement a basic, userspace, non-posix, asynchronous filesystem for Seastar","Seastar needs a filesystem that is fully asynchronous, and that's also aware of its shared-nothing design. That means, the on-disk format needs to take into account that each shard (Seastar terminology for core acting like an isolated machine) will have data that only belongs to itself, but very occasionally, two shards may share the same data. The good news is that there's no need for POSIX compliance. Seastar filesystem only needs to provide a notion of files (includes the ability to retrieve file info), and provide an asynchronous API for its users."

Space @ Virginia Tech,Esther Robb,Using machine learning to improve SuperDARN data classification,"This project aims to develop a new approach of classifying SuperDARN (Super Dual Auroral Radar Network) data using machine learning algorithms. In the past, this data has been classified using a formula based on elevation angle, which is not always reliably available, or using another formula based on doppler velocity and spectral width which is biased to miscategorize low-velocity ionospheric backscatter (IS) as ground scatter (GS). Recently, researchers successfully applied machine learning techniques to this data. These approaches improved on past methods, but they used a very limited set of features and relied on simple machine learning methods that do not easily capture non-linear relationships or subtle probability distributions. This project will apply machine learning methods with a focus on using a larger number of well-selected features and using more nuanced algorithms. At the end of the summer, I will deliver a GitHub toolkit with the machine learning tools, a set-up and usage guide, a report on accuracy and validation, and an online graphing tool on the SuperDARN website."
Space @ Virginia Tech,Sneha Singhania,BoLN and ST-ResNet:  Deep Predictive Models for GPS TEC Maps,"GPS TEC Map (Global Positioning System - Total Electron Count) is an important quantity of the ionosphere for analysis of space weather. Building an accurate predictive model for TEC maps can help in anticipating adverse ionospheric events (ex: solar storms), thereby safeguarding critical communication, energy and navigation infrastructure.

Two deep learning models are proposed for prediction of TEC maps, namely, BoLN (Boosted LSTM Network) and ST-ResNet (Spatio Temporal Residual Network).  BoLN is designed on LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) and boosted with effective feature extraction of previous TEC maps using CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks), and exogenous data (ex: DST, AE, SYM-H, ASY-H Index data and OMNI data) using Autoencoders. BoLN exploits spatial map relationships through CNNs and long term dependencies through LSTM.

In ST-ResNet, a Residual Network is operated on a 3D volume of data (stack of previous TEC maps) to capture temporal dependencies (by convolving along depth) and spatial dependencies (by convolving along width and height) to produce the forecasted image. ST-ResNet has never been adapted and applied to Space Science data, leaving enough room for research."

This app will be a smaller version of Sugarizer. The app will be targeted towards Pre-k1 and Pre-k2 grade curriculum. The app will be focusing on kids who are non-readers and who are in the phase of developing their thinking, learning and collaborating abilities. The app will be made colorful so that it is fun & enjoyable for the kids. Sugarizer activities will include things like, learning about music, drawing shapes and learning basic mathematical concepts through games like Cuisenaire rods. Such activities will help kids learn counting, addition, subtraction in an engaging and fun-filled way. Existing educational apps available online are too difficult for kids & the smallness of the icons of existing apps makes it difficult for the kids to play. Hence, our application can address these shortcomings. The goal of Sugarizer Primero is to allow kids to use Sugarizer as a powerful learning tool. We will ensure that the graphics used in the user interface are bright and of a suitable size, so that it can attract kids attention."

Sugar Labs,Rahul Bothra,Implement cross version Python support for Sugar,"### Aim:
This project aims to implement Python2 as well as Python3 support for Sugar Toolkit and port Sucrose to Python 3.

### Importance:
Sugar currently runs on Python2, and Python 2's support is waning. Also, GStreamer is withdrawing support from Python 2 very soon, as a consequence of which Sugar will no longer run on Debian, and soon, on Ubuntu. This project is critical for our viability and relevance. This project will also extend our product life on older systems used by schools

### Schedule:
A broad timeline would be to complete the in-progress port of Sugar Toolkit, Datastore and Artwork. After that, Sugar [core] will be ported and tested. I will complete this in the first 6 weeks of GSoC. After that, I will continue porting activities, starting with the set of Fructose, which are the core demonstration activities for Sugar. I will also write a script that will help developers continue porting activities to Python 3 easily. Once all this is complete, I will keep on porting more activities, if time permits."

Analyzing temporal behavior may require trajectory representations of nodes that capture both structural and attribute properties of graphs in an evolving graph space. Here, the task is to explore non-linear models (e.g. deep learning) to effectively represent nodes in a vector space for studying evolution of networks. This module would facilitate an effective learning process (e.g., node classification, link prediction, graph reconstruction) for many real-world problems including label propagation, information diffusion, community influence etc. that can be applied on top of many heterogeneous networks."
Swift,Kazutaka Homma,Swift Compiler Integration with External Tools,"The Swift compiler has a library called LibSyntax, which aims to represent the full contents of the source file, provides Swift and C++ APIs for reading files, generating other Swift files, and analyzing them. The LibSyntax tree is generated during the build operation, but the Swift compiler does not offer any mechanism for an external tool to access the tree data at the moment. This project aims to utilize the LibSyntax tree as an existing resource by supplying the framework for an external tool to communicate with the compiler, which would enable a simpler development for custom linters, formatters, and other tools."
SymPy,Akash Vaish,Improving Probability and Random Processes,"SymPy statistics module supports a variety of probability distributions, including finite, continuous, discrete distributions. The aim of this project is to make the module support a variety of new features, by building upon the already existing ones. This involves implementing joint distributions and compound distributions, which will in turn allow the assumption of dependence between random variables. The project also aims to implement the random processes Markov Chains and random walks, which are not implemented at all. Finally, the ability to export SymPy random variable objects to other Statistical libraries is also something that will be achieved during the course of the project."

SymPy,Yathartha Anirudh Joshi,Solvers: Completing Solveset,"One of the major features of any Computer Algebra System is solving equations. Sympy too have a powerful `solve` function that can solve a lot of equations, but due to its complex API and inability to give infinite solutions, `solveset` was implemented. Solveset is under development since 2014 and since then solveset is being developed to solve varied type of equations. But there is a lot of work that needs to be done to make `solveset` complete. For this, one of the major equation solver, i.e. transcendental equation solver needs to be implemented. Currently `solveset` is unable to handle such equations, therefore, to make `solveset` powerful and versatile `transolve` needs to be implemented. `transolve` will mainly cover equations like logarithmic, exponential, equations solvable by LambertW and trigonometric. Apart from this `solveset` also needs to give a unified result for a union of `ImageSet`, and that is why `_union()` in `ImageSet` also needs to be implemented. Modular eqautions, hyperbolic equations and implementing BigUnion and BigIntersection are other things that will make `solveset` complete."

As an adult, it’s pretty easy to go through the game's choices and pick the “right” ones. But I think the target audience here is young girls who may not actually be sure what’s safe and acceptable. Rather than asking them to try the scenario and potentially end up with a bad outcome, I think it would be more helpful to them if there was narrative explanation as to why certain choices are good or bad.

So, I’d like to:

- Design and add scalable framework for introductory sequences to scenarios
- Design and add scalable framework for providing out-of-character contextual information
- Write and implement introductory sequences for scenarios
- Source and include contextual information (in a style and manner in line with the game aesthetic) for existing scenarios
- Provide precedence and guidelines for adding similar contextual information to new scenarios/events"

The Eclipse Foundation,Pradeep Eswaran,Kuksa-based LWM2M Implementation,"LWM2M protocol is becoming the standard for remotely managing a device through a set of normalized operations. However, although its semantics can be implemented on any kind of protocols, the LWM2M specification is written in a way that it is tightly coupled to the CoAP protocol, compliant with a lossy network such as UDP or SMS transport. The goal of this specification is to propose an alternative composition of LWM2M semantics with CoAP message format based on MQTT publish/subscribe paradigm. The addition of CoAP Message Encryption  support inside Kuksa implementation of LWM2M provies IoT developers an increase sense of security when using LWM2M protocol.  Eclipse Leshan already provides java client and server implementations. Consequently, the Leshan protocol adapter must be added to the running Kuksa environment such that device registry and device management services can be utilized. Evaluation of LWM2M communication for real-world vehicle use cases and implementations of the protocol can be done in the RPI3 Rover."

It will have a trusted agent that is hidden from the normal world, responsible for taking snapshots of the kernel memory, and performing dynamic analysis on kernel memory. This will provide several advantages over existing methods of dynamic analysis, such as being invisible to even the kernel, and leaving minimal artefacts for malicious programs to realize that they are being profiled."

The Honeynet Project,Mathieu Dolmen,DRAKVUF : Process Injector Enhancement,"**DRAKVUF** allows to inject a binary directly into a running virtual machine. The current implementation uses either `CreateProcessA()` or `ShellExecuteA()` from the Windows API, which implies to have the program we want to execute into the guest’s filesystem. Furthermore, once the function is called, the process will have the name of that file. It can further lead a malware to detect the presence of **DRAKVUF** if we run known analysis tools.

To solve this issue we can use a more advanced technique to inject our binary. Among all the possibilities, the **Process Doppelgänging** technique seems the most suitable. It allows to inject the binary directly into the memory, without modification on the filesystem, by using **NTFS transaction**."

With high level of stealthiness, DRAKVUF can be used for further new and novel honeypot, intrusion detection system and dynamic malware analysis."
The Honeynet Project,Ulrich Fourier,#9 - DRAKVUF: Support for Dynamic Malware Analysis on ARM,"The relevance of ARM processors is rising. Especially since ARM recently started targeting the servers and desktop market, thus going beyond the mobile devices. That’s why malware targeting ARM is becoming an even bigger threat every day. On the other hand, it is still the x86 architecture for which most reverse engineering tools are developed. This Google Summer of Code (GSoC) project aims to add ARM support for both the dynamic analysis framework DRAKVUF and the virtual machine introspection (VMI) library libvmi. The idea is to base our project upon the result of an earlier GSoC project which added altp2m support for Xen on ARM. The altp2m subsystem defines different views on the guest’s physical memory and allows to dynamically switch among them. With altp2m and DRAKVUF we are able to build a stealthy VMI framework. In summary, the goal of the GSoC project is to add support for DRAKVUF for ARM and thus provide more options for reverse engineering on the ARM architecture."

The Honeynet Project,Vlad Florea,Application for the Honeypot Detection Tool,"The goal of this project is to create a tool that can scan a system for features which would let an attacker know prematurely it is a honeypot. This way he could avoid attacking it and thus avoid getting caught, making the honeypot useless. Security researchers could use it to scan their honeypot systems for such features before deploying them online or in production, in order to avoid mistakes. The tool should be able to generate a report with its findings and their severity so that appropriate action can be taken by the developer.

These features may include: bugs, configuration mistakes or default configurations left unchanged, unimplemented services, service combinations that wouldn’t make sense on the same machine or on the current operating system, unusual response times, etc."
The Honeynet Project,anant-joshi,Semi-automated DroidBot: Semi-automated Android UI testing,"The solution will consist of an Android app, that will read the input provided by the user, and generate an interaction model, which can be read by DroidBot, and used for automating the appropriate view.

Firstly, for every new page, a layout will be generated. The dumpWindowHierarchy method can be used to dump the layout to a file, and this file can be read to understand the events associated with it. This will be useful later, when the input events need to be reconciled.

Touch input events will be recorded using the getevent tool. Simple touches and gestures will be differentiated. Only events that are contained within the layout area will be processed by the system.

Since getevent isn't reliable for keypress input, it cannot be used. Instead, an IME that logs text input will be implemented. This reduces logical complexity by not having to parse getevent logs for keyboard input, when keyboard layouts can vary wildly.

The input events will be reconciled with the UI, by performing the input actions on the innermost element that the X and Y values of the input were contained within.

Interactions can be sent to droidbot either as a script, or by directly deserializing the UTG class."
The Honeynet Project,ctsung,Automated Malware Relationship Mining,"The Holmes Project has recently acquired a large dataset of labeled malware artifacts, which can be used for deep learning based malware relationship mining. This labeled dataset of over 20k samples should be a big help to do malware relationship detection. Besides, as a result of the previous GSoC’17, we also have an efficient data model for the malware relationships.

I will implement a learning model to generate knowledge base, which will be integrated into an analytic pipeline in the end. Besides, to make it more user-friendly, I will build a portable deployment of Holmes Processing. A better visualization of relationship aggregation from different malware analysis services will also be implemented.

The Java Pathfinder Team,Guolong Zheng,Synthesis to repair heap-manipulating programs using Java StarFinder,"The state of art of program repair for heap manipulating program  has focus on specific properties of bugs, like null pointer dereference. We try to fix programs with pre-condition and post-condition written in separation logic. Given a program, we first run JSF to collect its post-state(p) by symbolic execution with the given pre-condition. Then we check if p entails the given post-condition(p'). If not, a bug is detected. Our approach to program repair has two main components: abduction and repair specification inference. First, we propose to infer the missing information to establish the post-condition through abduction using an existing solver. In particular, we infer a constraint f such that p \* f is satisfied and p \* f |-> p'. Secondly, based on abduction, we symbolically execute the input program with the abduction in a backward manner in order to construct repair specifications at every line of the input program. These repair specifications help to infer valid Hoare-style triples with fix candidates."

To achieve this goal, my strategy is to have a working Gradle build coexisting with the current Ant script. Ant targets will migrate to Gradle tasks in an incremental and iterative process. By the end of the program, is expected to have the Gradle support fully integrated into the main repository."
The Java Pathfinder Team,Soha Hussein,Extending Veritesting In SPF,"Veritesting, [1] is a promising technique that speeds up dynamic symbolic execution by multiple of factors [2]. In veritesting, expensive forking is minimized by statically analyzing and summarizing regions of code, which are then used during dynamic symbolic execution.
During summer, I plan to a) extend veritesting to support test case generation for static re- gions, b) optimize instantiation of high-order regions based on benchmark results and c) work on a prototype to support static regions for 2-threaded programs."
The Libreswan Project,Rishabh Chaudhary,Web based Certificate and Profile User Interface,"There are shell scripts for creating X.509 certificates, revoking certificates and signing CRLs and scripts for the creation of Profile certificate files for certain devices such as Linux, Apple OS X, Windows, iOS, etc., these require careful specification of various certificate attributes so that these certificates work on a variety of devices: Android, Windows, iOS/OSX, Linux, etc. 
The goal of this project is to gather all that knowledge into a simple interface which should support the following:
* Generating the proper ipsec.conf configuration based on web admin interface including DNS/split-DNS configurations.
* Allow Administrator to invite new users using email id.
* A new user after account validation can download the generated certificate/profile (over TLS) for different platforms.
* The generated certificates/profiles can only be downloaded once, through the portal.
* Admin can list, revoke/disable (temporary revocation) user certificates/profiles.
* Generate PKCS#12 certificates for users.
* Generate iOS/OSX .mobileconfig profiles for automatic installation on iOS/OSX.
* Ipsilon user authentication to web application.
* Configure munin-node to work with libreswan plugin."
The Libreswan Project,Sahana Prasad,Extend RFC-7427 Signature Authentication support to IKEv2 with ECC / EDDSA support,"Libreswan itself currently only supports RSA as Digital Signature Authentication method, so it needs to be extended internally as well to be able to use other methods, such as ECDSA or EDDSA. Implementation of ECC/ECDSA requires the modification of the existing Libreswan public key code to fix  the RSA only parts so that it is able to accept different new types of keys in the future ( not just limited to EDDSA ). Libreswan will then be compliant to RFC-7427 and RFC-8247."

The three features in question are ""[**Group Key Managment using IKEv2**](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-yeung-g-ikev2-13 ""Group Key Managment using IKEv2"")"", ""[**Redirection Mechanism for IKEv2**](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5685 ""Redirection Mechanism for IKEv2"")"" and ""[**IKEv2 Session Resumption**](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5723 ""IKEv2 Session Resumption"")"". The ""*Redirection Mechanism for IKEv2*"" will be implemented before the first evaluation period, and after that it will be dynamically decided (with the libreswan mentors) whether to continue with implementing ""*Group Key Managment using IKEv2*"" or ""*IKEv2 Session Resumption*"". The reasons for that approach are described in project proposal. 

""*Redirection Mechanism for IKEv2*"" and ""*IKEv2 Session Resumption*"" are features that will improve the performance of VPN servers, especially the ones that serve a lot of VPN clients. ""*Group Key Managment using IKEv2*"" will enable key exchanging for secure Multicast communication."

The Linux Foundation,Lakshay Bandlish,Idea: Enhancements for ipptool,"Ipptool is a program that allows sending IPP requests to a specific printer or server in order to test it or to receive printer information in the form of responses. It is used by CUPS to pass requests like get-printer-attributes, get-jobs, print-job to the printer.

Ipptool is also used by PWG’s IPP Everywhere self-certification program’s software, which is used by printer manufacturers to test if their printers satisfy IPP Everywhere standards. The IPP Everywhere Self-Certification program does not test the printers for some of the operations and attributes required by IPP Everywhere. This project involves writing scripts to cover these standards and new scripts for other IPP specifications. It also involves writing the program ippfuzz to fuzz-test printers."

The NetBSD Foundation,Saad Mahmood,Machine-independent EFI bootloader,"With the increase of availability of ARM devices and the multi-vendor system adopted by ARM it was becoming increasingly difficult for kernel and distribution maintainers to support ARM devices. This was because that very minute changes in the device configuration i.e. peripherals on chip and off-chip functionality, required the kernel to be rebuilt or modified for that specific device. This is obviously very difficult to maintain and support.

There are two main goals of the project. First one is to add EFI support for ARM machines. Ever since the release of 64-bit ARM processors, ARM holdings has specified the UEFI to be recommended bootup method for modern machines. Second is the addition of support for FDT (or Flattened Device Tree). The addition of FDT will enable the use of a generic kernel for all ARM devices.

The Wine Project,moihack,Direct3D - Automated game benchmarks,"Wine is a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on several POSIX-compliant operating systems. Thanks to Wine, lots of Windows software with no known alternative to other platforms can be run and used as is. This even allows for Windows games to run on Linux, an area which still suffers in terms of title availability. As Wine development continues, monitoring performance of different 3D titles can become a time consuming task with no standard results due to different gameplay each time a user play-tests a game. Some scripts that monitor performance already exist for some old titles. The purpose of this project is to pick some more recent games that offer a benchmark mode and write scripts that configure, run the benchmark and read the results. Newer titles are more of a challenge for today's systems (and Wine) and should provide us with clear results regarding any performance improvements between Wine revisions."
The ns-3 Network Simulator Project,Davide Magrin,A simulation execution manager for ns-3,"The envisioned solution consists in the creation of a python library that can

   the aim of this library is to make obtaining and organizing results from
   multiple ns-3 script executions straightforward: users will only need to
   worry about writing the desired simulation script and specifying the range of
   parameters they desire to run the script with. The framework will then
   optimize the execution of the needed simulation runs, store the results in a

The ns-3 Network Simulator Project,Jude Niroshan-1,Trust-based routing protocols framework,"ns-3 contains different routing modules, both for IPv4 and for IPv6. None of them is trust-based. Given the increasing interest on trust-based routing schemes to increase and improve the network resilience Vs routing attacks, it would be useful to have a general approach for Trust-based schemes. As a matter of fact, there are multiple trust-based extensions for well known protocold (e.g., AODV), but each one modifies in a particular way the single routing protocol, making it difficult to export the solution to other routing schemes."
The ns-3 Network Simulator Project,Sourabh Jain,Direct Code Execution upgrade,"Direct Code Execution is a framework for ns-3. It allows the users to execute Linux kernel and Linux userspace networking applications inside ns-3 without changing their code. In order to provide such functionality, DCE integrates network simulator with custom Linux kernels like net-next-sim or net-next-nuse (LibOs). But net-next-nuse has not kept pace with latest versions of Linux kernel. This has been the major hindrance for DCE to use latest Linux kernel. An active alternative to LibOs is Linux Kernel Library (LKL), which provides similar features of LibOs and supports latest Linux kernel versions. In this project, LibOs will be replaced with LKL from DCE to support the networking stack of Linux. Currently, DCE uses custom implementation of libc; this makes it hard to maintain the code base. The another aspect of this project is to drop the custom libc and embed the musl libc in DCE."
The ns-3 Network Simulator Project,WenYing Dai,Implementation of AccECN and ECN++ in ns-3,"Reducing Internet Transport Latency is an interesting research topic and has gained significant attention in the recent past. Some of the promising new solutions rely on Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) (RFC 3168) to notify TCP endpoints of congestion that may be developing in a bottleneck queue, without resorting to packet drops. As a result, there have been attempts at Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to extend the functionality of ECN and provide rich feedback to TCP endpoints. In this regard, Accurate ECN feedback (AccECN) and ECN++ are two active topics of discussion at IETF. This project proposal is to: extend the ECN implementation in ns-3 to support AccECN and ECN++, test the correctness of implementation and provide examples."

a) Data sequence generators + checkers. These generate given bit data stream, then after transmission and receiving check that the bit data stream is correct.

b) Data channel wrappers. These give you a common interface to controlling the parameters of a channel used in transmission and receiving. For simple data channels this might just provide clock control. For more advanced channels, like the high speed transceivers, this provides things like controlling parameters like pre-emphasis, equalisation, etc.

c) Host computer Control GUI / Console. This gives a nice interface for controlling all the parameters and seeing the results of various tests."

X.org Foundation,Nayan Deshmukh,Improve the Linux/DRM GPU scheduler to feed one entity into multiple run queues,All the GPU drivers have a scheduler component that schedules the job received from the applications on the GPU hardware. Recently the amdgpu’s (AMD’s graphics driver) scheduler was shifted to a common space (now called DRM GPU scheduler) so that the other drivers can reuse the code. The GPU scheduler is now used by amdgpu and etnaviv (graphics driver for Vivante GPUs). It provides entities which allow userspace to push jobs into queues which are then executed by a hardware run queue. Now amdgpu has multiple identical hardware queues and we currently map round robin to the software queues provided by the GPU scheduler when those are created. To better balance the load we could extend the scheduler to feed multiple hardware queues from just one software queue provided by the GPU scheduler.

Or in other words, apps definitely get points for being pretty. The Zulip mobile application can be regarded as a work-in-progress. I shall work the on the following areas and improve it so the application may move closer towards completion.

* Overhaul and rebuild several major elements of the interface to achieve a more even, symmetric and uniform look.

* Adopt principles of Material Design for the application.

* Fix many small but annoying issues such as broken alignment in some menus, ripple and other effects overflowing into other elements, non-standard icons, animation delays, asymmetric margins etc.

* Improve support for different resolutions and pixel densities so nothing is out of place on a 18.5:9 or 18:9 display, or in landscape mode.

Most of Zulip's REST API is currently undocumented, which is a pity considering how powerful it is. The first project in my proposal is to solve this by working in our **Swagger/OpenAPI docs** until we have a 100% documented REST API. The relevant code examples will also be updated so we can provide fully functional scripts that show how to use it.

After that, issue #6932 will then be addressed so we can provide a reliable manner to **forward emails** to a realm's admins based in our current email mirroring tooling.

And finally, some improvements to our **i18n** infraestructure: add a string prioritization system that improves translator's workflow by letting them know which strings are more important for us (and therefore should be translated first)."

As a part of my GSoC proposal, I plan to implement the **Uncertain Knowledge and Reasoning** sections as well as the **Learning** section of the book. I also plan to introduce the relevant **alternate implementations** in the **extras** module.

Besides this, I also plan to develop the testing suite for the above-mentioned sections of the project. Depending upon the scope of requirements, I would also be interested in working on some application demos of various algorithms that provide a clearer picture to the reader. I have experience in developing algorithm demonstrations and hence would also like to contribute to the same."
aimacode,ad71,Finish AIMA-Python algorithms and add explanatory notebooks,"The aim of this project is to finish incomplete implementations of the algorithms in aima-python, and refactor some of the existing ones that do not work as intended. It also aims to add tests for these algorithms and increase the coverage of the existing ones. Detailed jupyter notebooks and visualizations will be written explaining the intuition behind the concepts, the functioning and the usage of the algorithms with real-world examples."
appleseedhq,Fedor Matantsev,Embree Integration,"Embree is a collection of high-performance ray tracing kernels, developed at Intel and being adopted by a range of commercial renderers such as VRay or Corona. Using embree inside appleseed might lead to significant performance gain. Moreover, there are interesting side effects: support for variety of geometry types, curve types, advanced opensubdiv caching and state-of-the-art multi-segment motion blur handling.

I will be happy to work with appleseed and make it even better. 

I want to thank François Beaune and Esteban Tovagliari for invaluable assistance!"
appleseedhq,oktomus,Adaptive image plane sampling proposal,"Current implementation of adaptive sampling needs to be overwriten so that it is more efficient, easier to use for any user and more robust regarding animations. Up to now, appleseed's image plane adaptive sampler is based on a per-pixel variance analysis. To work correctly, it requires a large amount of initial samples, which is not convinient. Moreover, each pixel analysis isn't aware of its neighbours and this lead to an image still noisy."
appleseedhq,rgirish28,Hair Rendering II - Hair shader and binary format,"The project aims to add three main components to the appleseed render to improve the hair and fur pipeline. Firstly, the addition of per vertex attributes to the curves primitive in order to create a more robust hair fibre curve representation. Secondly, the creation of a hair binary file format to import hair geometry from popular modelling softwares and export the format for ease of data flow in production. It will also support conversion from different binary hair file formats to the new native format. Finally, the addition of an advanced hair shading model that is tuned for production rendering. It is a physically based hair shader that captures the effects of the light scattering through hair fibres. The model is importance sampled and also has various parameters to change physical properties in the hair like refractive index and colour absorption and distribution. This project will fix one of the main deficiencies of the appleseed renderer and help the renderer challenge other production renderers for the mantle of the best."
coala,Ankit Joshi,Integrate pyflakes-enhanced AST into coala,"The idea, here, is to integrate **pyflakes-enhanced AST** into coala as a **metabear** which can then be used to develop various plugins. The second part of the project involves redesigning flake8 plugins **flake8-future-import** and **flake8-builtins** in such a way that they use pyflakes-enhanced AST over python AST. Finally, a wrapper is to be created which supplies a python AST to flake8 plugins so that they work as it is."

coala,Ishan Srivastava,Quickstart Green Mode,"It is tough for a new user to quickly grasp and start using the settings provided by coala. The user needs to be aware of the bears he might possibly need for his project and also the settings provided by the bears. Many of them directly opting for individual linting softwares when coala can provide a unified environment for them. This way many are never able to unleash the true power of coala. The first runs of coala should involve as less user interaction as possible, so that new users can realize how hassle free it is to use coala **over** a collection of linting technologies. Quickstart should be able to learn the bear settings from the project.

This project adds the capabilities to coala-quickstart by making smart analysis, depending upon the format already followed by the users, may it be separate formatting used for separate files or for a separate group of files (eg. grouped in a specific folder) or for different language files.

Many major communities don't use a fixed coding styles that the bears provide. The quickstart should be able to adapt itself and generate a config file which matches as closely to the codebase as it possibly can for easy and quick adoption."

Since all the major IDE's and code editors are now starting to support the standard Microsoft Language Server protocol it is now possible to expose coala's capabilities via the one said protocol and support a wide range of code editors. This proposal outlines the project where I intend to build one such server loosely based upon the proof of concept implementation built for vs-code.

freifunk,Alexander Paetzelt,Easily Expandable Wireless Intrusion Detection System,"While analyzing already available Open Source Wireless Intrusion Detection Systems (WIDS), I realized that there is no full-featured solution yet. Kismet is the biggest effort to have such system. However it is far away from being able to detect most of the known attacks. Beside Kismet, there are many small projects dedicated to only one or some WiFi attacks. While they might indeed detect the attacks at stake, they are neither compatible to Kismet nor do they provide detection for a wide range of attacks. Kismet, however, provides a plugin system which only allows loading of additional software written in C++ or as a webapp. 

This may increases the complexity for developers not experienced to C++ or who don't want to familiarize themselves with Kismet. The 'Easily Expandable Wireless Intrusion Detection System' (EEWIDS) tries to overcome this limitation and hereby tries to create a full-featured and expandable solution based on microservice approach. It does not matter in which way a developer plans to detect an attack or even what programming language she/he prefers."

But the main additions to make are: a full screen map, better color representation of nodes which are online or offline and possibly if they went offline a day ago, list of all nodes and accessibility to every node individually and to show some basic information about the node. This would greatly reduce the time when a node goes offline and a technician fixing it. Also users will be able to see how the network is working or if there is a problem they could alert someone or even fix the problem themselves."

LibreMesh already does extensive use of IPv6 technology, we even have an IPv6 mesh tunnel broker provider based on Tinc VPN. It works very well but configuring the tunnel is a manual work that requires specific skills which are not common in the majority of communities. Because of this, communities often are not taking advantage on IPv6 while their routers already support and make good use of it. To improve this situation the student should design a semi-automatic system to grant access to trusted routers to LibreNet6 (this may include key exchange) and code a tiny LiMe module that take care of tunnel configuration."

gRPC,Heli Wang,Support Static Type-Checking of gRPC Python and of Code Using gRPC Python,"Python’s dynamic type system makes it easy to introduce bugs into programs, which is one of the most popular complaints against the language. One attempt to fix this are type annotations. Type annotations allow programmers to specify type of function parameters and return values, which are described in PEP 484. However, type annotations syntax itself is not sufficient to prevent programmers to run buggy code containing invalid type operations. Static type checks are designed to check source code for type errors by looking at type annotations. As for the project,  type-checker Pytype will be integrated with gRPC for static type-checking.

The ideal deliverable of the static type-check integration with gRPC will be a pre-commit hook to automatically run pytype before a commit can be made, which will be optional to force developers to run type checkers before committing. If possible, continuous integration tools like Travis-CI for automate type-checking and testing."
gRPC,Naresh Ramesh,Enable building of gRPC Python with Bazel,"gRPC Python currently has a constellation of scripts written to build the project, but it has a lot of limitations in terms of speed and maintainability. Bazel is the open-sourced variant of Google's internal system, Blaze, which is an ideal replacement for building such projects in a fast and declarative fashion. But Bazel in itself is still in active development, especially in terms of Python (amongst a few others).

This project aims to fill this gap and attempt to build gRPC Python with Bazel. Although filed under gRPC, this project also targets contribution to Bazel for Python."

libvirt,Sukrit Bhatnagar,Automatic freeing of resources,"Writing cleanup code for every variable in large-scale open-source projects makes the code difficult to comprehend. The cleanup tasks like releasing resources are necessary and without them, there may be leaks. GNU C provides a variable attribute `cleanup` that runs a specified function automatically when the associated variable goes out of scope. The aim of this project is to incorporate this cleanup functionality into the libvirt code base. Another aspect of this project will be to ensure that adding this functionality does not change the intended behaviour of the code.
The deliverable will be an integration of cleanup code into the libvirt code base which does not interfere with the main logic, making the code more concise and comprehensible while maintaining intended functionality."

mlpack,Atharva Khandait,Variational Autoencoders,"Variational Autoencoders(VAEs) are widely used in unsupervised learning of complicated distributions. The more classical generative models depend upon sampling techniques such as MCMC. These sampling techniques are unable to scale to high dimensional spaces, for example distribution over set of images. Due to this reason, VAEs get rid of sampling by introducing gradient based optimization. 

I propose a project where I will implement a VAE framework for both feed forward and recurrent networks with rigorous testing and seamlessly integrate it with the current ann codebase of mlpack. I have kept in mind both ease of use for novice users and complete control over the VAE network for advanced users. In addition to a class, reproduction of results from the papers and a command line program will also be added. In the end, I will add a tutorial to help users get familiar with the framework."
mlpack,Haritha Sreedharan Nair,Neural Collaborative Filtering,"Recommendation systems are widely used in various online and offline platforms, collaborative filtering being the most commonly used method for implementing them. Most collaborative filtering algorithms, including the ones existing in mlpack, use matrix factorization for this. Although MF is de facto, it cannot deal with complex user-item relationships and also need the user to provide ratings explicitly (explicit feedback). This project proposal deals with these drawbacks by implementing a module for neural collaborative filtering, which can represent complex user-item interaction using neural networks and also can handle implicit feedback (comprising any interaction user has with any item as a positive instance). Neural collaborative filtering, if needed, can also be generalized to matrix factorization. NCF has been proved to give better hit ratio and other metrics than neighborhood based algorithms, and also gives comparable RMSE with existing CF methods in mlpack. This module can give much more flexible recommendations, even when there is less explicit feedback available."
mlpack,Manish Kumar,LMNN (via LRSDP) & BoostMetric Implementation,"Many cognitive techniques, such as recognition and categorization are assumed to have need of establishing
similarities between perceptual or conceptual representations. Basically when facing situations similar to what we have encountered before. This phenomenon signalled the development of many mathematical models of similarity.

Metric learning is one amongst those models that perform the task of devising similarities over objects. It has a plethora of applications in fields like information retrieval and recommendation system. Also, many machine learning approaches rely on some metric. This includes unsupervised techniques such as clustering, supervised procedures like KNN classification and semi-supervised modes as well. Metric learning has been involved as a preprocessing step for many of these approaches.

Henceforth learning a neat distance metric is a crucial task for forming similarities. LMNN & BoostMetric are among the supervised distance metric learning techniques which excel in this task. Accordingly, the fundamental objective of this project is to code novel implementations of LMNN & BoostMetric, with the purpose of achieving better benchmarking over kNN classification."

2. Add CF models which are more expressive, and models which can take implicit feedbacks into consideration (e.g. BiasSVD, SVD++).
3. Benchmark the cf module with public datasets (e.g. MovieLens, Netflix).
4. Accelerate program execution by identifying and modifying the codes which are slowing down the execution."

openSUSE,Asad,Develop Container-based backend for openQA,"OpenQA is an automated testing software developed by openSUSE to test the operating system installation process. Automated testing of operating system is important because, installation is a time-consuming process and when a new OS is released, it is not possible to test all possible combinations for installation options in a timely manner, these installation options include, type of image, type of installation medium (USB, DVD, UEFI), operating system options (KDE, GNOME) etc. OpenQA uses image recognition to test the full stack i.e., bootloader, installer and applications.
OpenQA works by the interaction of three software components i.e., web application, worker and os-autoinst. Container based services are becoming increasingly popular and these services are often packaged into container images. Adding the capability of testing container images into openQA, will provide stable container environments and enhanced testing. The aim of this project is to develop a container backend for openQA. The component os-autoinst already provides various backends such as qemu and integrating container backends like docker and LXC is going to add value to openQA and community."

Radare has its own decompiler ‘radeco’. Some of its analysis are developed, but it is not still implement pseudo C backend. In this proposal, I will describe a plan to make radeco generate pseudo C Code."
radare,mandlebro,[Cutter] Implement Debugging and Emulation support,The idea is to implement a debugging view in Cutter which allows to run/rerun the current binary with multiple r2 dbg/io plugins.
radare,sivaramaaa,Type Inference,Implement a basic type inference based on function arguments/return types and callgraph
strace,Chen Jingpiao,seccomp-assisted syscall filtering,"SECCOMP_RET_TRACE seccomp API could be used to implement a more efficient syscall filtering. Using this technique, tracees will be stopped on entering filtered syscalls only instead of all syscalls."
strace,Zhibin Li,Comprehensive test suite,"The point of this project is about coverage of branches of parsers as well as corner cases. In other words, there are mainly two parts. At first, add tests for newly added functions, features (new features for the test suite itself, too) , etc. Secondly, improve existing test cases with the aim at corner cases (type of variables, issues related to pointers, signedness, etc)."
vitrivr,Huirong Liu,Huirong's proposal,"We aim to explore methods to subtitle into video for Vitrivr platform, compare all methods and picked the best one to be integrated into the platform"
vitrivr,Vaibhav Maheshwari,vitrivr App,"This project targets at making Android app for vitrivr. Currently vitrivr has a web UI which is vitrivr-ng but it is not optimised for mobile use. vitrivr App will close that gap between vitrivr and mobile devices. Also this project will include adding/improving features of cineast like Spatial Retrieval and Add Media API. Spatial Retrieval will allow users to query on the basis of Location while Add Media API will allow users to add media directly from UI rather than writing commands on cineast server. Integrated with these, it will create a cohesive experience for mobile users which will allow them to query media from a huge server, collaborate with people or query media from own mobile device."
webpack,Dhruvdutt Jadhav,webpack-cli: Infrastructure and Automation Work - Dhruvdutt,"### webpack-cli: Infrastructure and Automation Work
This document majorly proposes most crucial things on the CLI roadmap like AST refactoring, static typing, scaffolding and transformations for new commands plus many other general improvements."
webpack,Jevan Chan,Webpack dependencies with WebAssembly,"The performance issue, or bundle time speed-up, is a common challenge for modern JavaScript/web bundler. As one of the most powerful module bundlers in recent year, Webpack team endeavors to enhance the bundling performance. In the latest version of Webpack 4, several improvements like new plugin system and parallelization with cache with UglifyJs have been implemented and accomplish a considerable performance enhancement. In this project, some cores and dependencies of Webpack will be re-implemented in other JS-like languages or low-level languages, and WebAssembly binaries will be generated from them with the corresponding compilers. Some automation tools will be used or developed to help to convert existing JavaScript sources as well as future works to other languages. At the same time, backward compatibility of earlier Node.js versions will be maintained. Besides, Node.js C++ Addons will also be tried as an option to compare the improvement in overall performance.  It can be considered to be a significant performance enhancement with this project in the future Webpack release."
webpack,Vincent Chan,Deep Scope Analysis,"I want to contribute to Webpack project by implementing one of the proposed ideas, namely “Deep Scope Analysis”. The program will traverse the ASTs to analyze all the scopes in  modules. Hence, it can distinguish unused exported variables and functions. Then Webpack can do tree-shaking from these informations to reduce the size of bundle."
