## Being an Ally

Suppose you are a straight,
physically able,
white or Asian male without mental health issues:
why should you care about people who are marginalized because they aren't these things?
One argument is self-interest:
study after study has shown that more diverse teams perform better,
that companies with more diverse management are more profitable,
and so on [[Zhan2020][Zhan2020]].

**The real reason**

Telling people they should support fair play because it will benefit *them*
implies that they would have no reason to do so if it didn't,
and implies that self-interest is the only legitimate justification for human action.
I disagree very strongly with that position;
instead,
I think the reason you should treat people fairly is that not doing so makes you an asshole.
An organization's culture is defined by the worst behavior it tolerates [[Gruenert2015][Gruenert2015]];
I believe that who we are as individuals is defined by the same test.
</div>

Another reason to care about these issues is that
discussion of fair play stops being theoretical as soon as we talk about your rights as an employee.
Until recently there has been less discussion of this in tech than of intellectual property rights,
but in the wake of incidents like [Google's decision to fire the AI researcher Timnit Gebru][gebru-firing],
programmers are belatedly realizing that
the industry they have created will treat them just as callously as it treats everyone else.

Standing up to a bad boss or an unfair professor is easier in theory than in practice,
because the student's evaluation of the professor doesn't affect the professor
nearly as much as the professor's evaluation of the student affects the student.
This imbalance is why management fads like "radical candor" are bullshit
(in the technical sense of the word [[Frankfurt2005][Frankfurt2005]]).
Managers can find ways to fire people who say things they don't like far more easily
than can find ways to hold their bosses accountable.

The only effective way to address power disparities like these is collective action:
many people with relatively little power can defend their rights if they band together.
Forty years of sustained disinformation from the rich and powerful
have made many people believe that collectives are intrinsically inefficient or that they stifle innovation;
ironically,
the entrepreneurs and CEOs who are the most vocal proponents unrestricted capitalism
all organize their companies along socialist lines [[Phillips2019][Phillips2019]].

As an example of what working together looks like,
consider the difference between a ride-sharing company like Uber
and the house-cleaning cooperative [Up&Go][up-and-go].
Uber uses its control of the app that connects customers with drivers
to extract profits by squeezing drivers.
In contrast,
the people who work for Up&Go own the app as a group;
5% of what customers pay goes to its upkeep,
and the rest goes to the workers [[Thompson2019][Thompson2019]].
There might be one less billionaire in the world,
but everyone else benefits.

Up&Go is an example of a commons:
something managed jointly by a community according to rules they have evolved themselves.
All three parts of that definition are essential:
a commons isn't just a shared pasture or an open source software stack—it also includes
the community that shares it and the rules they use to do so [[Bollier2014][Bollier2014],[Ostrom2015][Ostrom2015]].
As [[Mildenberger2019][Mildenberger2019]] describes,
the idea of "the tragedy of the commons" gets things completely wrong:
people exploiting a shared resource so much that it collapses is what happens when a commons breaks down.

**Your politics are showing**

An early reviewer of this material asked
whether it was appropriate for me to put so much of my personal politics into it.
I pointed out that many schools have a course on the business of software
that talks exclusively about for-profit startups backed by private investors and venture capital.
Choosing to discuss those topics is also political—it's just more common.

There isn't a lot you can do as a student or as a junior programmer to fix what's broken in our industry,
but it's never too early to start practicing.
An ally is a someone with unearned advantages
who tries to understand their own privilege
and create an environment that's fair for everyone.
As [this guide][dlf-active-bystander] from the [Digital Library Foundation][dlf] explains,
there are several ways to be an active bystander,
i.e., to lend your privilege to defuse situations and defend people who are being attacked.

[[Dobbin2019][Dobbin2019]] (summarized in [[Dobbin2020][Dobbin2020]])
found that most of what American companies have done over the past twenty years
to reduce sexual harassment and discrimination
has either had no effect or made things worse.
The reason is that the people who care don't gain anything from being told they should,
while the people who are part of the problem resent being told that
and tend to take out their anger on the people the training is meant to protect.

However,
[[Dobbin2019][Dobbin2019]] also found that showing people how to intervene *did* make a difference,
since this made them more likely to do so
in the same way that having some first aid training makes you more likely to take action in a crisis.
As an example,
your instructor can have you work through scenarios like this one
with your teammates and the rest of your class:

> Your and your teammates frequently work together in the business school library
> (which has better WiFi and more comfortable chairs than the computer labs).
> Every time you do, one of your teammates makes a point of sitting beside some
> younger students that they find attractive and talking with them.  It's clear
> from those students' body language that they find the attention unwelcome;
> you've pointed this out to your teammate, but their behavior has continued.
> What should you do next?

Neither of these scenarios is about programming, but I hope you understand by
now that the success or failure of your project depends on a lot more than just
the code you write.  Learning how to handle situations like these may also help
you become more compassionate: if you've never had to worry about them, the odds
are that (in John Scalzi's memorable analogy)
you've been playing at the lowest difficulty level there is your whole life, and
as a result don't realize how much harder things are for others whose default
setting isn't "easy
mode" [%b Scalzi2012 %].

### How far back should we go?

[%g preparatory_privilege "Preparatory privilege" %] is the advantage
someone has in a supposedly objective assessment as a result of opportunities
earlier in life that other people didn't have.  Ignoring it is like ignoring the
difference between professional athletes who are paid to train all day and
amateurs whose jobs only allow them to train in the evening or on weekends, or
pretending that people doing interviews in their second or third language are on
an equal footing with people who are interviewing in their native language.

But imagine you're about to have a meeting with someone.  There's a box with
half a dozen cookies in the room, so you help yourself to a couple before the
other person shows up. When they do, you have to make a choice: do you say,
"I've already had two, so I should only have one more and you should get three"
or, "There were four cookies in the box when you arrived, so we get two each"
(meaning that you will have had four in total).

Most people would say that the first answer is the moral one—in my experience,
people who don't aren't people you'd want on your team.  On the other hand, if I
had a couple of cookies yesterday or last week, I probably won't feel obliged to
give you more than half today.  Is it a company's responsibility to take past
inequities into account when hiring?

If the company is interested in on-the-job performance, the answer is "yes".
Going back to the athletic analogy, an amateur who can run a hundred meters in
12 seconds could perform better than a professional who can do it in 11 *once
they start training full-time*, i.e., once their disadvantage is removed.
Similarly, female students are less likely to be called on in class and more
likely to be given non-coding tasks in team projects than male students.  If
they can get a B despite that, they will probably outperform a male student who
only gets an A with the deck stacked in his favor, provided the company treats
both equally after they are hired.

That last statement is where many companies and universities fail despite good
intentions.  The [Centre for Community Organizations][coco] has a depressing
summary of what it's like to be [the "problem" woman of color in the
workplace][coco-problem].  If what it describes isn't familiar, you might be a
part of the problem, just as I was in my teens and twenties.

**Setting limits**

Men who want an excuse to continue to be assholes sometimes try to be clever
with words and talk about "diversity of thought," meaning, "I should be allowed
to be offensive as long as I don't raise my voice."  This is an example of the
[paradox of
tolerance][paradox-of-tolerance]: if a group is tolerant without limit,
it will eventually be undermined by the intolerant taking advantage of that. As
James Baldwin said, "We can disagree and still
love each other unless your disagreement is rooted in my oppression and denial
of my humanity and right to exist."
