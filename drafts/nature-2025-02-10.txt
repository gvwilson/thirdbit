1. If you had to limit yourself to recommending just a few actions, what would they be?
   1. Put open licenses on everything you can, make sure colleagues have copies, and copy their data/code/whatever in return
      - This isn't just about human threats: talk to anyone who lost work because of Hurricane Katrina
   2. Use a password manager (I recommend 1Password), two-factor authentication, and Signal (it's the only trustworthy messaging app out there)
   3. Don't open that attachment, install that software, or click on that link without checking
      - Or talk to the "journalist" who just cold-called you without verifying their credentials
      - Universities and many companies are practially training us to be unsafe
   4. Lobby your professional association to have policies and plans in place just in case
      - Incoherent, uncoordinated response from PAs and institutions encourages further attacks

2. Is the threat real for most research scientists, or only for those researching specific areas such as vaccines and reproductive health?
   - There's a continuum of risk, but the problem is that we don't know
   - Nobody at the CRU thought they were at risk until Climategate happened
   - Cancer rates in shrimp in the Gulf of Louisiana suddenly became "political" after the Deepwater Horizon disaster

3. How bad can the consequences get - is it about mental/emotional turmoil, or is there physical danger?
   - As with censorship, the turmoil is the point
     - Hurt a few to scare the rest
   - But ask Anthony Fauci how safe he feels these days…
   - …or anyone involved in reproductive health care for women in the US

4. Is it hard to convince people to change their online habits?
   - Yes: just as hard as getting people to practice safe sex was in the 1980s
   - "Security theatre" on the part of institutions is a big part of the problem
     - "Be safe!" but "I'll send your performance review as a Word document"

5. Do academics generally find it tricky to navigate the technical side of all of this (such as using a VPN)?
  - Yes: "Why Johnny Can't Encrypt" was published in 1999 and nothing has gotten easier
  - The current rush to put AI in everything is only making matters worse

6. Can threats come from "inside the fortress" – academic colleagues with different values, for instance? Are people aware of this?
   - Absolutely: sometimes people with different values, but more often people who are afraid for their jobs
     - Strong analogies here with people (not) speaking up about incidents of sexual harassment
   - What about the departmental secretary? The sys admin? The 22-year-old incel working at the company that hosts the university's email?

Threat models:

- Casual threat ("drive by"): opportunistic but not determined
  - But see "institutional threat" below
- Intimate threat: a life partner (not a big one for this conversation)
- Insider threat: "inside the fortress"
- Institutional threat: the rules change and now you're a target
  - Elon Musk can now read the tax records of every American, and the work emails and personnel evaluations of every government scientist
