title: How to Save What You Can

I grew up in a logging town in British Columbia.
There weren't as many forest fires then as now,
and they weren't as severe,
but as July turned to August people would make sure they always had a full tank of gas
and a change of clothes packed for the kids.
They'd stop on the street to talk to their noeighbors about who was going to look in on Mrs. Kerr
to make sure she was OK,
or ask the pharmacy for an extra order of tyheir prescription because,
well,
you never know,
do you?

Forty-five years later,
it's time—it's well past time—to start making plans like these for our research projects.
The Trump administration has launched an unprecedented assault on science;
thousands of people have been fired,
thousands of others have had their funding cut,
and things are going to get a lot worse before they (hopefully) get better.
What should you do if you're a PI
and you get the email saying that some coked-up tech bro in Washington has cut your funding
because you used the word "diverse" in a grant application eight years ago?
You have until the end of the month (say, two weeks) to clean up and clear out.
Your team is one post-doc, three grad students, and half an RSE.
Your data, code, papers, and collective memory are scattered across Google Drive, Slack, GMail, GitHub,
and the departmental server.
What specific steps do you take, in what order, and why?

1.  Remember that *the only plan that works is one you've practiced*
    (or as my dad once said, a full tank of gas is no use if you can't find the car keys).
    Once you and your team have made a plan,
    try it out:
    you will immediately discover two things that don't actually work
    and three others you have overlooked.

1.  *Make sure you can communicate with each other.*
    My family didn't own a walkie-talkie,
    but a lot of others did.
    Your team will need a way to coordinate without Slack or departmental email;
    a [Signal][signal] group is one option,
    but a mailing list that includes everyone's work and personal addresses
    is probably a better option.
    (Think attachments, search, etc.)

1.  *Make backups.*
    More specifically:
    1.  *Make sure you're __allowed__ to make backups*
        by putting open licenses on everything you can.
    1.  *Make sure you don't back up things you're not allowed to,*
        because if you accidentally copy sensitive or restricted material and someone finds out,
        you could have your entire backup taken away.
        (No, this is not a hypothetical scenario…)
    1.  *Run your backup nightly, starting now.*
        This isn't just to make sure you have everything:
        running the backup nightly is the best way to test that it actually works,
        and when the hammer falls,
        other people may be scrambling to pull their data out of the university systems as well,
        which will be practically indistinguishable from a denial-of-service attack.

1.  *Swap with colleagues.*
    "I'll store your data if you'll store mine" is a good strategy,
    especially if the two of you are in different countries.
    (Note: if you're *not* in the US,
    don't make the mistake of thinking your next election couldn't possibly put you in this situation.)
    And while you're at it,
    swap checklists:
    what did you think of that they didn't and vice versa?
