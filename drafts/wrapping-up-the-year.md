Another year over and what have I done?

-   I left [Deep Genomics][dg-leave] and [joined Plotly][plotly-join].
    Still don't think I'm cut out to be a manager,
    but I've deleted several hundred GitHub repositories
    and closed a couple of thousand stale issues.

-   The Python version of [*Software Design by Example*][sdxpy] came out.

-   I started playing the penny whistle.
    I find the sound a bit shrill compared to the tenor sax,
    but it's the only thing I've tried that doesn't aggravate my tendon problems.

-   I ran [the teaching workshop][t3] a couple of times to raise money for [Rainbow Railroad][rr],
    who need support now more than ever.

-   I appeared on the [Code for Thought][code-thought],
    [CoRecursive][corecursive],
    and [Software Unscripted][unscripted] podcasts.

-   I went to [a conference][scipy2024] for the first time since COVID
    and visited the [Capilano Suspension Bridge][capilano] for the first time in fifty years.

-   We wound down [It Will Never Work in Theory][nwit] and wrote [a retrospective][nwit-retro] about it.

-   I wrote [a tutorial on SQL][sql-tutorial] for data scientists.
    I started a couple of others,
    but since I don't have an audience or venue lined up,
    I doubt I'll ever finish them.

-   I ran for the board of the Python Software Foundation and [came seventh][psf-results].

-   I didn't finish any of the children's books I've been writing off and on for the last few years,
    sell any short stories,
    or find a writing group in Toronto.
