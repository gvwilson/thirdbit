Another year over and what have I done?

-   Finish one of the children's books I've been writing off and on for the last few years:
    nope.
    Didn't sell any short stories or find a writing group in Toronto, either.

-   Change jobs:
    yup.

-   The Python version of [*Software Design by Example*][sdxpy] came out.

-   Pick up another musical instrument:
    I've been playing the penny whistle now and again.
    I don't love the sound,
    but it's the only thing I've found that doesn't aggravate my tendon problems.

-   Run [the teaching workshop][t3] a few more times to raise money for [Rainbow Railroad][rr]:
    did it twice.

-   Wound down [It Will Never Work in Theory][nwit] and wrote [a retrospective][nwit-retro] about it.

-   Wrote [a tutorial on SQL][sql-tutorial] for data scientists,
    both to teach myself SQL and to stop myself from going nuts from boredom
    during my last couple of months in my previous job.

-   Appeared on the [Code for Thought][code-thought],
    [CoRecursive][corecursive],
    and [Software Unscripted][unscripted] podcasts.

-   Ran for the board of the Python Software Foundation;
    [came seventh][psf-results].
