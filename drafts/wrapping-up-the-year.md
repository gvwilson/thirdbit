title: "Wrapping Up the Year"
date: 2024-12-30

Another year over and what have I done?

-   I left [Deep Genomics][dg-leave] and [joined Plotly][plotly-join].
    Still don't enjoy managing as much as I enjoy coding and teaching,
    but I've deleted several hundred GitHub repositories
    and closed a couple of thousand stale issues.

-   The Python version of [*Software Design by Example*][sdxpy] came out.
    Reviewers seemed to like it,
    but sales and website traffic have been disappointing.
    I don't know if it's because I'm not working hard enough to get the word out,
    whether long-form prose is out of fashion,
    or whether I'm barking up the wrong tree.

-   I started playing the penny whistle.
    I find the sound quite shrill compared to the tenor sax,
    but it's the only thing I've tried that doesn't aggravate my tendon problems,
    and it's definitely improving my lung capacity.

-   I ran [the teaching workshop][t3] a couple of times to raise money for [Rainbow Railroad][rr],
    who need support now more than ever.

-   I appeared on the [Code for Thought][code-thought],
    [CoRecursive][corecursive],
    and [Software Unscripted][unscripted] podcasts.

-   I went to [a conference][scipy2024] for the first time since COVID
    and visited the [Capilano Suspension Bridge][capilano] for the first time in fifty years.

-   We wound down [It Will Never Work in Theory][nwit] and wrote [a retrospective][nwit-retro] about it.

-   I wrote [a tutorial on SQL][sql-tutorial] for data scientists.
    I started a couple of others,
    but since I don't have an audience or venue lined up,
    I doubt I'll ever finish them.

-   I ran for the board of the Python Software Foundation and [came seventh][psf-results].
    In retrospect I'm not surprised:
    I haven't really been part of the community in years.

-   I didn't finish any of the children's books I've been writing off and on for the last few years,
    write any new short stories,
    or find a writing group in Toronto.

What have I read that I would recommend?
Top of the list is Samantha Harvey's Orbital,
which deserves all the praise it has been given—I can't remember
the last time I read something so beautifully written.

So what about the year to come?

-   My daughter will finish high school in June and leave home in August to start college.
    I don't know how we're going to fill our evenings and weekends without her,
    but we might finally get around to terracing the slope in our back yard.

-   I'll be supervising some [undergrad][browsercast] [projects][mossball] at the University of Toronto
    for the first time in 15 years.

-   I'm going to keep trying to write fiction,
    but without peers to write *for* or the prospect of a market,
    it's a hard slog.

-   The same holds for the penny whistle:
    I have to find a teacher or a group to play with or I probably won't stick with it.
    (By way of which,
    if you know anyone organizing small ensemble lessons in Toronto's east end
    please give me a shout—the only person I can find is on the other side of the city.)
