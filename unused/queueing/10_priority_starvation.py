    # Priority Starvation

    ## *When High-Priority Traffic Crowds Out Low-Priority Jobs*

    A single server processes two job classes:

    - High-priority jobs (class H) arrive frequently and are served quickly.
    - Low-priority jobs (class L) arrive rarely and take longer to serve.

    The server always picks the highest-priority job available. Total server utilization $\rho = \rho_H + \rho_L < 1$, so the server has spare capacity on average. Yet low-priority jobs can wait far longer than the utilization level suggests they should.

    ### Static Priority: Starvation at Moderate Load

    With a static priority queue, high-priority jobs *never* yield to low-priority ones. Even when $\rho_H < 1$, high-priority bursts can lock out low-priority jobs for extended periods. The mean wait for low-priority jobs under a static non-preemptive priority queue is:

    $$W_L = \frac{\overline{s}_L}{1-\rho_H} \cdot \frac{1}{1-\rho_H-\rho_L}$$

    This diverges as $\rho_H \to 1$ independently of $\rho_L$. As $\rho_H$ approaches 100%, low-priority jobs wait arbitrarily long, even if only a few low-priority jobs ever arrive.

    ### Aging: Solving Starvation Creates Oscillation

    The standard remedy for starvation is *priority aging*: a waiting job's priority improves over time until it eventually beats even high-priority arrivals. This guarantees finite wait for all jobs.

    However, aging introduces a new pathology. When aged low-priority jobs finally burst through, they occupy the server and leave a backlog of high-priority jobs waiting. The high-priority queue then drains, and the cycle repeats — producing oscillating bursts rather than smooth, uniform service.

    ### Intuition

    Suppose H jobs arrive in random bursts. During a burst, the server never pauses for L jobs. An L job unlucky enough to arrive at the start of a long burst must wait for every H job in that burst to be served before getting its turn. As bursts grow more frequent (larger $\rho_H$), the expected burst length grows, and with it the expected wait for that unlucky L job. The math confirms: starvation is a real risk at moderate $\rho_H$, not just at extreme loads.

    ### What aging does

    Aging assigns each waiting L job a maximum patience time $T_{\max}$. After waiting $T_{\max}$, the job is promoted to high priority. This caps the worst-case wait: no L job can wait longer than $T_{\max}$ plus one service time. Mathematically, the effective $W_L$ is bounded by $T_{\max} + 1/\mu_L$.

    ## Practical Implications

    Priority queues appear throughout computing:

    - OS scheduling: interactive processes (high priority) vs. batch jobs (low priority). Linux uses dynamic priority aging (nice values + sleep bonuses) to avoid starvation.
    - Network QoS: real-time traffic (VoIP, video) vs. bulk data. Traffic shaping with Deficit Round Robin (DRR) or Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) guarantees bandwidth shares without starvation.
    - Database query planning: short OLTP queries vs. long OLAP queries. Resource groups and query timeouts implement a form of aging.

    ## Implementation

    Two runs are compared:

    1. Static priority: H jobs are inserted as `(0, ...)` and L jobs as `(1, ...)` into a `Queue(priority=True)`. The server always picks the smallest key first, so H jobs are always served before L jobs.
    2. Aging: an `Ager` process wakes up every `AGING_INTERVAL` time units, inspects waiting L jobs, and promotes sufficiently old ones by reducing their priority key until it falls below the H threshold and they move into the server's feed queue.

    ## Understanding the Math

    ### Mean wait for two-priority queues

    Let $\lambda_i$, $\mu_i$, and $\rho_i = \lambda_i / \mu_i$ be the arrival rate, service rate, and utilization of class $i \in \{H, L\}$. For a non-preemptive priority queue:

    $$W_H = \frac{R_0}{1 - \rho_H}$$

    $$W_L = \frac{R_0}{(1 - \rho_H)(1 - \rho_H - \rho_L)}$$

    where $R_0 = \tfrac{1}{2}(\lambda_H \overline{s_H^2} + \lambda_L \overline{s_L^2})$ is the mean residual work seen by an arriving customer. The ratio $W_L / W_H = 1/(1 - \rho_H)$ grows without bound as $\rho_H \to 1$.

    ### Utilization of each class

    Let $\lambda_H$ be the arrival rate of high-priority jobs (H) and $\mu_H$ be their service rate. The utilization contributed by H jobs alone is $\rho_H = \lambda_H / \mu_H$ — the fraction of server time that H jobs would consume if they were the only class. Similarly, $\rho_L = \lambda_L / \mu_L$ for low-priority jobs. The total utilization is $\rho = \rho_H + \rho_L$. Requiring $\rho < 1$ means the server has enough capacity for both classes on average.

    ### Why "on average" is not enough

    Even when $\rho < 1$, randomness creates bursts of H arrivals. During a burst, the server is continuously occupied by H jobs, and L jobs must wait in the background. The mean wait for low-priority jobs in a non-preemptive priority queue is:

    $$W_L = \frac{R_0}{(1 - \rho_H)(1 - \rho_H - \rho_L)}$$

    where $R_0$ is the mean residual work in the system when a job arrives. The critical observation is the factor $(1 - \rho_H)$ in the denominator. As $\rho_H \to 1$, this factor approaches zero and $W_L \to \infty$ — even if $\rho_L$ stays small and the total load $\rho$ is comfortably below 1.

    ### The trade-off

    Without aging, $W_L$ can be infinite when $\rho_H$ is large. With aging, $W_L \leq T_{\max} + 1/\mu_L$, but during promotion events the effective $\rho_H$ spikes temporarily, increasing $W_H$. Choosing $T_{\max}$ is a design decision: a small $T_{\max}$ protects L jobs but forces more promotions and penalizes H jobs more often; a large $T_{\max}$ is kinder to H jobs but allows L jobs to wait longer. There is no setting that simultaneously minimizes both — the trade-off is fundamental.
